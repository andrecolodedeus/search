<h1>On Marriage and Concupiscence (Book II)</h1>

<h2>Preliminary notes</h2>

<h3>(1) From the Preface of Augustine's <q>Unfinished Work Against Julianus.</q></h3>

<p>I Wrote a treatise, under the title <em>On Marriage and Concupiscence</em>, and addressed it to the Count Valerius, on learning that he had been informed of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> that they charge us with condemning marriage. Now in that treatise I showed the distinction, as criticially and accurately as I was able, between the good of marriage and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of carnal concupiscence,&mdash; an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is well used by conjugal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. On receiving my treatise, the illustrious man whom I have named sent me in a short paper  a few sentences culled from a work of Julianus,  a Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. In this work he has thought fit to extend to four books his answer to the before-mentioned treatise of mine, which is limited to one book only, <em>On Marriage and Concupiscence</em>. I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to whom we were indebted for the said extracts: he confined his selection, evidently on purpose, to the first book of Julianus' work. At the request of Valerius, I lost no time in drawing up my answer to the extracts. And thus it happened that I have written a second book also under the same title; and in reply to this Julianus has drawn up to eight books, in excess of his loquacious powers.</p>

<h3>(2) From Augustine's Epistle to Claudius [CCVII.].</h3>

<p><q>Whoever has perused this second book of mine, addressed (as the first was) to the Count Valerius, and drawn up (as, indeed, both were) for his use, will have discovered that there are some points in which I have not answered Julianus, but that I meant my work rather for him who made the extracts from that writer's books, and who did not arrange them in the order in which he found them. He deemed some considerable alteration necessary in his arrangement, very probably with the view of appropriating by this method as his own the thoughts which evidently were another person's.</q></p> 

<h2>The book itself</h2>

<p>Augustine, in this latter book, refutes sundry sentences which had been culled by some unknown author from the first of four books that Julianus had published in opposition to the former book of his treatise <q>On Marriage and Concupiscence;</q> which sentences had been forwarded to him at the instance of the Count Valerius. He vindicates the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> doctrine of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from his opponent's cavils and subtleties, and particularly shows how diverse it is from the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Manicheans.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1 [I.]&mdash; Introductory Statement.</h2>

<p>I Cannot tell you, dearly loved and honoured son Valerius, how great is the pleasure which my heart receives when I hear of your warm and earnest interest in the testimony of the word of God against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; and this, too, amidst your military duties and the cares which devolve on you in the eminent position you so <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> occupy, and the pressing functions, moreover, of your political life. After reading the letter of your Eminence, in which you acknowledge the book which I dedicated to you, I was roused to write this also; for you request me to attend to the statement, which my brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Alypius is commissioned to make to me, about the discussion which is being raised by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> over sundry passages of my book. Not only have I received this information from the narrative of my said brother, but I have also read the extracts which he produced, and which you had yourself forwarded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, after his departure from Ravenna. On discovering the boastful language of our adversaries, as I could easily do in these extracts, I determined, with the help of the Lord, to reply to their taunts with all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfulness</a> and scriptural authority that I could command.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2 [II.]&mdash; In This and the Four Next Chapters He Adduces the Garbled Extracts He Has to Consider.</h2>

<p>The paper which I now answer starts with this title: <q> <em>Headings out of a book written by Augustine, in reply to which I have culled a few passages out of books</em>.</q> I perceive from this that the person who forwarded these written papers to your Excellency wanted to make his extracts out of the books he does not name, with a view, so far as I can judge, to getting a quicker answer, in order that he might not delay your urgency. Now, after considering what books they were which he meant, I suppose that it must have been those which Julianus mentioned in the Epistle he sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>,  a copy of which found its way to me at the same time. For he there says: <q>They go so far as to allege that marriage, now in dispute, was not instituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;a declaration which may be read in a work of Augustine's, to which I have lately replied in a treatise of four books.</q> These are the books, as I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, from which the extracts were taken. It would, then, have been perhaps the better course if I had set myself deliberately to disprove and refute that entire work of his,  which he spread out into four volumes. But I was most unwilling to delay my answer, even as you yourself lost no time in forwarding to me the written statements which I was requested to reply to.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; The Same Continued.</h2>

<p>The words which he has quoted and endeavoured to refute out of my book, which I sent to you, and with which you are very well acquainted, are the following: <q>They are constantly affirming, in their excessive <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of us, that we condemn marriage and that divine procedure by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> creates <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings by means of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, inasmuch as we maintain that they who are born of such a union contract original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and do not deny that, of whatever <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> they are born, they are still under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> dominion unless they be born again in Christ.</q>  Now, in quoting these words of mine, he took care to omit the testimony of the apostle, which I adduced by the weighty significance of which he felt himself too hard pressed. For, after saying that men at their birth contract original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, I at once introduced the apostle's words: <q>By one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for in him all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152197"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> Well, as I have already mentioned, he omitted this passage of the apostle, and then closed up the other remarks of mine which have been now quoted. For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> too well how acceptable to the hearts and <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a> of all faithful <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are these words of the apostle, which I had adopted, but which he omitted&mdash;words which are so direct and so clear, that these new-fangled <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> use every effort in their dark and tortuous glosses to obscure and deprave their force.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; The Same Continued.</h2>

<p>But he has added other words of mine, where I have said: <q>Nor do they reflect that the good of marriage is no more impeachable by reason of the original <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is derived therefrom, than the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and fornication can be excused by reason of the natural good which is born of them. For as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the work of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, whether derived from this source or from that; so is man, whether born of this or that, the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Here, too, he has left out some words, in which he was afraid of catholic ears. For to come to the words here quoted, it had previously been said by us: <q>Because, then, we affirm this doctrine, which is contained in the oldest and unvarying rule of the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, these propounders of novel and perverse <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, who deny that there is in infants any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be washed away in the laver of regeneration, in their unbelief or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> us as if we condemned marriage, and as if we asserted to be the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> work what is God's own work, to wit, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being which is born of marriage.</q>  All this passage he has passed over, and merely quoted the words which follow it, as given above. Now, in the omitted words he was afraid of the clause which suits all hearts in the catholic Church and appeals to the very <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which has been firmly established and transmitted from ancient times with unfaltering voice and excites their hostility most strongly against us. The clause is this: <q>They deny that there is in infants any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be washed away in the laver of regeneration.</q> For all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> run to church with their infants for no other reason in the world than that the original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is contracted in them by their first and natural birth may be cleansed by the regeneration of their second birth.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; The Same Continued.</h2>

<p>He then returns  to our words, which were quoted before: <q>We maintain that they who are born of such a union contract original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and we do not deny that, of whatever <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> they are born, they are still under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> dominion unless they be born again in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> Why he should again refer to these words of ours I cannot tell; he had already cited them a little before. He then proceeds to quote what we said of Christ: <q>Who willed not to be born from the same union of the two sexes.</q> But here again he quietly ignored the words which I placed just previous to these words; my entire sentence being this: <q>That by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> they may be removed from the power of darkness, and translated into the kingdom of Him who willed not to be born from the same union of the two sexes.</q> Observe, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, what my words were which he shunned, in the temper of one who is thoroughly opposed to that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God which comes through our <q>Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> well enough that it is the height of improbity and impiety to exclude infants from their interest in the apostle's words, where he said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father: <q>Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of His dear son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152200"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse13">Colossians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> This, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, is the reason why he preferred to omit rather than quote these words.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; The Same Continued.</h2>

<p>He has next adduced that passage of ours, wherein we said: <q>For there would have been none of this shame-producing concupiscence, which is impudently praised by impudent men, if man had not previously <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; while as to marriage, it would still have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, even if no man had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>: for the procreation of children would have been effected without this disease.</q> Up to this point he cited my words; but he shrank from adding what comes next&mdash; <q>in the body of that chaste life, although without it this cannot be done in 'the body of this death.'</q> He would not complete my sentence, but mutilated it somewhat, because he dreaded the apostle's exclamation, of which my words gave him a reminder: <q>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152201"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24</a></span> For the body of this death <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> not in paradise before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; therefore did we say, <q>In the body of that chaste life,</q> which was the life of paradise, <q>the procreation of children could have been effected without the disease, without which now in the body of this death it cannot be done.</q> The apostle, however, before arriving at that mention of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> misery and God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which we have just quoted, had first said: <q>I see another law in my members warring against the law of my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and bringing me into captivity to the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is in my members.</q> Then it is that he exclaimed, <q>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord.</q> In the body of this death, therefore, such as it was in paradise before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there certainly was not <q>another law in our members warring against the law of our mind</q>&mdash; which now, even when we are unwilling, and withhold consent, and use not our members to fulfil that which it desires, still dwells in these members, and harasses our resisting and repugnant mind. And this conflict in itself, although not involving condemnation, because it does not consummate <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is nevertheless <q>wretched,</q> inasmuch as it has no peace. I think, then, that I have shown you clearly enough that this man had a special object as well as method in quoting my words: he adduced them for refutation in such manner as in some instances to interrupt the context of my sentences by removing what stood between them, and in other instances to curtail them by withdrawing their concluding words; and his reason for doing all this I think I have sufficiently explained.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7 [III.] Augustine Adduces a Passage Selected from the Preface of Julianus. (See <q>The Unfinished Work,</q> i. 73.)</h2>

<p>Let us now look at those words of ours which he adduced just as it suited him, and to which he would oppose his own. For they are followed by his words; moreover, as the person insinuated who sent you the paper of extracts, he copied something out of a preface, which was no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the preface of the books from which he selected a few passages. The paragraph thus copied stands as follows: <q>The teachers of our day, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother,  who are the instigators of the disgraceful faction which is now overheated with its <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, are determined on compassing the injury and discredit of the men with whose sacred fervour they are set on fire, by nothing less than the ruin of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; little thinking how much <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> they have conferred on those whose renown they have shown to be only capable of being destroyed along with the catholic religion. For, if one should say, either that there is <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> in man, or that God is the Creator of those that are born,  he is at once set down as a C&oelig;lestian and a Pelagian. To avoid being called <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, they turn Manicheans; and so, while shirking a pretended <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>, they incur a real reproach; just like the animals, which in hunting they surround with dyed feathers, in order to scare and drive them into their nets;  the poor brutes are not gifted with reason, and so they are thrust all together by a vain panic into a real destruction.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; Augustine Refutes the Passage Adduced Above.</h2>

<p>Well, now, whoever you are that have said all this, what you say is by no means <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; by no means, I repeat; you are much deceived, or you aim at deceiving others. We do not deny <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>; but, even as the Truth declares, <q>if the Son shall make you free, then shall you be free indeed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152206"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;8:36</a></span> It is yourselves who invidiously deny this Liberator, since you ascribe a vain liberty to yourselves in your captivity. Captives you are; for <q>of whom a man is overcome,</q> as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>of the same is he brought in bondage;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152207"><a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:19</a></span> and no one except by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the great Liberator is loosed from the chain of this bondage, from which no man living is free. For <q>by one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for in him all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152208"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> Thus, then, God is the Creator of those that are born in such wise that all pass from the one into condemnation, who have not the One Liberator by regeneration. For He is described as <q>the Potter, forming out of the same lump one vessel unto <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in His mercy, and another unto dishonour <span class="stiki" id="note152209"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;9:21</a></span> in judgment.</q> And so runs the Church's canticle <q>mercy and judgment.</q>  You are therefore only misleading yourself and others when you say, <q>If one should affirm, either that there is <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> in man, or that God is the Creator of those that are born, he is at once set down as a C&oelig;lestian and a Pelagian;</q>  for the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> says these things. If, however, any one says that there is a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> in man for worshipping God aright, without His assistance; and whosoever says that God is the Creator of those that are born in such wise as to deny that infants have any need of one to redeem them from the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: that is the man who is set down as a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of C&oelig;lestius and Pelagius. Therefore that men have within them a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, and that God is the Creator of those that are born, are propositions which we both allow. You are not C&oelig;lestians and <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> for merely saying this. But what you do really say is this, that any man whatever has freedom enough of will for doing good without God's help, and that infants undergo no such change as being <q>delivered from the power of darkness and translated into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152212"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse13">Colossians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> and because you say so, you are C&oelig;lestians and <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>. Why, then, do you hide under the covering of a common dogma for deceit, concealing your own special delinquency which has gained for you a party-name; and why, to terrify the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> with a shocking term, do you say of us, <q>To avoid being called <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, they turn Manicheans?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; The Catholics Maintain the Doctrine of Original Sin, and Thus are Far from Being Manicheans.</h2>

<p>Listen, then, for a little while, and observe what is involved in this question. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> say that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was created good by the good God as Creator; but that, having been corrupted by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it needs the physician Christ. The Manicheans affirm, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was not created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> good, and corrupted by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but that man was formed by the prince of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> darkness of a mixture of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> which had ever <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>&mdash; one good and the other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> and C&oelig;lestians say that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was created good by the good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but that it is still so sound and healthy in infants at their birth, that they have no need at that age of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> medicine. Recognise, then, your name in your dogma; and cease from intruding upon the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who refute you, a name and a dogma which belong to others. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> rejects both parties&mdash; the Manicheans and yourselves. To the Manicheans it says: <q>Have you not read that He which made man at the beginning, made them male and female; and said, For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they two shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more two, but one flesh. What, therefore, God has joined together, let not man put asunder.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152213"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;19:4-6</a></span> Now Christ shows, in this passage, that God is both the Creator of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the uniter in marriage of husband and wife; whereas the Manicheans deny both these propositions. To you, however, He says: <q>The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> has come to seek and to save that which is lost.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152214"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;19:10</a></span> But you, admirable <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as you are, answer Christ: <q>If you came to seek and to save that which was lost, then you did not come for infants; for they were not lost, but are born in a state of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: go to older men; we give you a rule from your own words: 'They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.'</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152215"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;9:12</a></span> Now, as it happens, the Manichean, who says that man has <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> mixed in his nature, must wish his good <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> at any rate to be saved by Christ; whereas you contend that there is in infants nothing to be sired by Christ, since they are already safe.  And thus the Manichean besets <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> with his detestable censure, and you with your cruel praise. For whosoever shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> your laudation, will never bring their babes to the Saviour. Entertaining such impious views as these, of what use is it that you fearlessly face that which is enacted for you  in order to induce salutary <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and to treat you as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, and not as that poor animal of yours which was surrounded with the coloured feathers to be driven into the hunting toils? Need was that you should hold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and, on account of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for it, have no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; but, as things are, you evade <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in such wise that, if you feared, you would rather run away from the net of the malignant one than run into it. The reason why your catholic mother alarms you is, because she fears for both you and others from you; and if by the help of her sons who possess any authority in the State she acts with a view to make you afraid, she does so, not from cruelty, but from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. You, however, are a very brave man; and you deem it the coward's part to be afraid of men. Well then, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and do not try with such obstinacy to subvert the ancient foundations of the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Although I could even wish that spirited temper of yours would entertain some little <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> authority, at least in the present case. I could wish, I say, that it would rather tremble through cowardice than perish through audacity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10 [IV.]&mdash; In What Manner the Adversary's Cavils Must Be Refuted.</h2>

<p>Let us now look at the rest of what he has joined together in his selections. But what should be my course of proceeding? Ought I to set forth every passage of his for the purpose of answering it, or, omitting everything which the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> contains, as not in dispute between us, only handle and confute those statements in which he strays away from the beaten path of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and endeavours to graft on catholic stems the poisonous shoots of his Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>? This is, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, the easier course. But I suppose I must not lose sight of a possible contingency, that any one, after reading my book, without perusing all that has been alleged by him, may think that I was unwilling to bring forward the passages on which his allegations depend, and by which are shown to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> deduced the statements which I am controverting as false. I should be glad, therefore, if the reader will without exception kindly observe and consider the two classes of contributions which occur in this little work of ours&mdash; that is to say, all that he has alleged, and the answers which on my side I give him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; The Devil the Author, Not of Nature, But Only of Sin.</h2>

<p>Now, the man who forwarded to your Love the paper in question has introduced the contents thereof with this title: <q>In opposition to those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who condemn matrimony, and ascribe its fruits to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> This, then, is not in opposition to us, who neither condemn matrimony, which we even commend in its order with a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> commendation, nor ascribe its fruits to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For the fruits of matrimony are men which are orderly engendered from it, and not the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which accompany their birth. Human beings are not under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> dominion because they are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, in which respect they are the fruits of matrimony; but because they are sinful, in which resides the transmission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is the author of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not of nature.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; Eve's Name Means Life, and is a Great Sacrament of the Church.</h2>

<p>Now, observe the rest of the passage in which he thinks he finds, to our prejudice, what is consonant with the above-quoted title. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> says he, <q>who had framed <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> out of the dust of the ground, formed Eve out of his rib, <span class="stiki" id="note152218"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse22">Genesis&nbsp;2:22-23</a></span> and said, She shall be called Life, because she is the mother of all who live.</q> Well now, it is not so written. But what matters that to us? For it constantly happens that our memory fails in verbal accuracy, while the sense is still maintained. Nor was it <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but her husband, who gave Eve her name, which should signify <em> Life</em>; for thus it is written: <q>And <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> called his wife's name Life, because she is the mother of all living.</q>  But very likely he might have understood the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> as testifying that God gave Eve this name through Adam, as His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. For in that she was called Life, and the mother of all living, there lies a great sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of which it would detain us long to speak, and which is unnecessary to our present undertaking. The very same thing which the apostle says, <q>This is a great sacrament: but I speak concerning Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,</q> was also spoken by <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> when he said, <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.</q>  The Lord Jesus, however, in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> mentions God as having said this of Eve; and the reason, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, is, that God declared through the man what the man, in fact, uttered as a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Now, observe what follows in the paper of extracts: <q>By that primitive name,</q> says he, <q>He showed for what labour the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> had been provided; and He said accordingly, 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.'</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152221"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> Now, who among ourselves denies that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was provided for the work of child-bearing by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, the beneficent Creator of all good? See further what he goes on to say: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, who created them male and female, <span class="stiki" id="note152222"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse27">Genesis&nbsp;1:27</a></span> furnished them with members suitable for procreation, and ordained that bodies should be produced from bodies; and yet is security for their capacity for effecting the work, executing all that exists with that power which He used in creation.</q>  Well, even this we acknowledge to be catholic doctrine, as we also do with regard to the passage which he immediately subjoins: <q>If, then, offspring comes only through sex, and sex only through the body, and the body through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who can hesitate to allow that fecundity is rightly attributed to God?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; The Pelagian Argument to Show that the Devil Has No Rights in the Fruits of Marriage.</h2>

<p>After these <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and catholic statements, which are, moreover, really contained in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, although they are not adduced by him in a catholic spirit, with the earnestness of a catholic <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, he loses no time in introducing to us the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Pelagius and C&oelig;lestius, for which purpose he wrote, indeed, his previous remarks. Mark carefully the following words: <q>You now who say, 'We do not deny that they, are still, of whatever <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> born, under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power, unless they be born again in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,' show us what the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> can recognise as his own in the sexes, by reason of which he can (to use your phrase) rightly claim as his property the fruit which they produce. Is it the <em>difference</em> of the sexes? But this is inherent in the bodies which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made. Is it their union? But this union is justified in the privilege of the primeval blessing no less than institution. For it is the voice of God that says, 'A man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.' <span class="stiki" id="note152224"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;2:24</a></span> It is again the voice of God which says, 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.' <span class="stiki" id="note152225"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> Or is it, perchance, their <em>fertility?</em> But this is the very reason why matrimony was instituted.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 14 [V.]&mdash; Concupiscence Alone, in Marriage, is Not of God.</h2>

<p>You see the terms of his question to us: what the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> can find in the sexes to call his own, by reason of which they should be in his power, who are born of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of whatsoever kind, unless they be born again in Christ; he asks us, moreover, whether it is the difference in the sexes which we ascribe to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, or their union, or their very fruitfulness. We answer, then, nothing of these qualities, inasmuch as the difference of sex belongs to <q>the vessels</q> of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; while the union of the two pertains to the procreation of children; and their fruitfulness to the blessing pronounced on the marriage institution. But all these things are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; yet among them he was unwilling to name that <q><a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, which is not of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but is of the world;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152226"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:16</a></span> and <q>of this world</q> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is said to be <q>the prince.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152227"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;14:30</a></span> Now, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> found no carnal concupiscence in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, because the Lord did not come as a man to men by its means. Accordingly, He says Himself: <q>The prince of this world comes, and finds nothing in me</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152228"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;14:30</a></span> &mdash; nothing, that is, of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; neither that which is derived from birth, nor that which is added during life. Among all the natural goods of procreation which he mentioned, he was, I repeat, unwilling to name this particular fact of concupiscence, over which even marriage blushes, which glories in all these before-mentioned goods. For why is the special work of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> withdrawn and hidden even from the eyes of their children, except that it is impossible for them to be occupied in laudable procreation without shameful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>? Because of this it was that even they were ashamed who first covered their nakedness. <span class="stiki" id="note152229"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;3:7</a></span> These portions of their person were not suggestive of shame before, but deserved to be commended and praised as the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They put on their covering when they felt their shame, and they felt their shame when, after their own disobedience to their Maker, they felt their members disobedient to themselves. Our quoter of extracts likewise felt ashamed of this concupiscence. For he mentioned the difference of the sexes; he mentioned also their union, and he mentioned their fertility; but this last concomitant of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> he blushed to mention. And no wonder if mere talkers are ashamed of that which we see <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> themselves, so interested in their function, blush to think of.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; Man, by Birth, is Placed Under the Dominion of the Devil Through Sin; We Were All One in Adam When He Sinned.</h2>

<p>He then proceeds to ask: <q>Why, then, are they in the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power whom God created?</q> And he finds an answer to his own question apparently from a phrase of mine. <q>Because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> says he, <q>not because of nature.</q> Then framing his answer in reference to mine, he says: <q>But as there cannot be offspring without the sexes, so there cannot be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without the will.</q> Yes, indeed, such is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For even as <q>by one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; so also has death passed through to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for in him all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152230"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> By the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will of that one man all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in him, since all were that one man, from whom, therefore, they individually derived original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <q>For you allege,</q> says he, <q>that the reason why they are in the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power is because they are born of the union of the two sexes.</q> I plainly aver that it is by reason of transgression that they are in the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power, and that their participation, moreover, of this transgression is due to the circumstance that they are born of the said union of the sexes, which cannot even accomplish its own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> function without the incident of shameful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. This has also, in fact, been said by Ambrose, of most blessed memory, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church in Milan, when he gives as the reason why Christ's birth in the flesh was free from all sinful fault, that His conception was not the result of a union of the two sexes; whereas there is not one among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings conceived in such union who is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. These are his precise words: <q>On that account, and being man, He was tried by every sort of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, and in the likeness of man He bore them all; inasmuch, however, as He was born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, He abstained from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For every man is a liar, and none is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only. It has accordingly,</q> adds he, <q>been constantly observed, that clearly no one who is born of a man and a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, that is to say, through the union of their bodies, is free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for whoever is free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is free also from conception of this kind.</q>  Well now, will you dare, you <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Pelagius and C&oelig;lestius, to call this man a Manichean? As the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Jovinian did, when the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> maintained the permanent <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of the blessed Mary even after child-bearing, in opposition to this man's impiety. If, however, you do not dare to call him a Manichean, why do you call us Manicheans when we defend the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the self-same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and with the self same opinions? But if you will taunt that most faithful man with having entertained Manichean <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in this matter, there is no help for it, you must enjoy your taunts as best you may, and so fill up Jovinian's measure more fully; as for ourselves, we can patiently endure along with such a man of God your taunts and jibes. And yet your heresiarch Pelagius commends Ambrose's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and extreme purity in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> so greatly, as to declare that not even an enemy could venture to find fault with him. Observe, then, to what length you have gone, and refrain from following any further in the audacious steps of Jovinian. And yet that man, although by his excessive commendation of marriage he put it on a par with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, never denied the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of Christ to save those who are born of marriage even fresh from their mother's womb, and to redeem them from the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. This, however, you deny; and because we oppose you in defence of those who cannot yet speak for themselves, and in defence of the very foundations of the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, you taunt us, with being Manicheans. But let us now see what comes next.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16 [VI.]&mdash; It is Not of Us, But Our Sins, that the Devil is the Author.</h2>

<p>He puts to us, then, another question, saying, <q>Whom, then, do you confess to be the author of infants? The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God?</q> I answer:  <q>Yes; the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</q> He then remarks, <q>But He did not make <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>;</q> and again asks, <q>Whether we confess the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to be the creator of infants?</q> Then again he answers, <q>But <em>he</em> did not create <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.</q> He then closes the subject, as it were, with this inference: <q>Since union is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and the condition of our bodies is degraded, therefore you ascribe our bodies to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> creator.</q> My answer to this is, I do not ascribe to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> creator our bodies, but our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; by reason of which it came to pass that, whereas in our bodies, that is to say, in what God has made, all was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and well-pleasing, there yet accrued in the intercourse of male and female what caused shame, so that their union was not such as might have been in the body of that unimpaired life, but such as we see with a blush in the body of this death. <q>But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> says he, <q>has divided in sex what He would unite in operation. So that from Him comes the union of bodies, from whom first came the creation of bodies.</q> We have already furnished an answer to this statement, when we said that these bodies are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But as regards the disobedience of the members of these bodies, this comes through the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh which <q>is not of the Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152233"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:16</a></span> He goes on to say, that <q>it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruits to spring from so many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, such as bodies, sexes, and their unions; or that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings should be made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the purpose of their being, by lawful right, as you maintain, held in possession by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> Now it has been already affirmed, that they are not thus held because they are men, which designation belongs to their nature, of which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is not the author; but because they are sinners, which designation is the result of that fault of nature of which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is the author.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17 [VII.]&mdash; The Pelagians are Not Ashamed to Eulogize Concupiscence, Although They are Ashamed to Mention Its Name.</h2>

<p>But among so many names of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, such as bodies, sexes, unions, he never once mentions the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> or concupiscence of the flesh. He is silent, because he is ashamed; and yet with a strange shamelessness of shame (if the expression may be used), he is not ashamed to praise what he is ashamed to mention. Now just observe how he prefers to point to his object by circumlocution rather than by direct mention of it. <q>After that the man,</q> says he, <q>by natural appetite <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his wife.</q> See again, he refused to say, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his wife by carnal concupiscence; but he used the phrase, <q>by natural appetite,</q> by which it is open to us to understand that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> will which wills the procreation of children, and not that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, of which even he is so much ashamed, forsooth, that he prefers to use ambiguous language to us, to expressing his mind in unmistakeable words. Now what is the meaning of his phrase&mdash; <q>by natural appetite</q>? Is not both the wish to be saved and the wish to beget, nourish, and educate children, natural appetite? And is it not likewise of reason, and not of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>? Since, however, we can ascertain his intention, we are pretty sure that he meant by these words to indicate the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the organs of generation. Do not the words in question appear to you to be the fig-leaves, under cover of which is hidden nothing else but that which he feels ashamed of? For just as they of old sewed the leaves together <span class="stiki" id="note152234"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;3:7</a></span> as a girdle of concealment, so has this man woven a web of circumlocution to hide his meaning. Let him weave out his statement: <q>But when the man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his wife by natural appetite, the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> says, Eve conceived, and bare a son, and called his name Cain. But what,</q> he adds, <q>does <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> say? Let us hear: I have obtained a man from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So that it is evident that he was God's work, and the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> testifies to his having been received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152235"><a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;4:1</a></span> Well, who can entertain a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on this point? Who can deny this statement, especially if he be a catholic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? A man is God's work; but carnal concupiscence (without which, if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had not preceded, man would have been begotten by means of the organs of generation, not less <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> than the other members to a quiet and normal will) is not of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but is of the world. <span class="stiki" id="note152236"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:16</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; The Same Continued.</h2>

<p>But now, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, look a little more attentively, and observe how he contrives to find a name wherewith to cover again what he blushes to unfold. <q>For,</q> says he, <q>Adam begot him by the power of his members, not by diversity of merits.</q> Now I confess I do not understand what he meant by the latter clause, <em>not by diversity of merits</em>; but when he said, <q>by the power of his members,</q> I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> he wished to express what he is ashamed to say openly and clearly. He preferred to use the phrase, <q>by the power of his members,</q> rather than say, <q>by the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh.</q> Plainly&mdash; even if the thought did not occur to him&mdash; he intimated a something which has an evident application to the subject. For what is more powerful than a man's members, when they are not in due submission to a man's will? Even if they be restrained by <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> or continence, their use and control are not in any man's power. Adam, then, begot his sons by what our author calls <q>the power of his members,</q> over which, before he begot them, he blushed, after his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If, however, he had never <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, he would not have begotten them by the <em>power</em>, but in the <em><a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a></em>, of his members. For he would himself have had the <em>power</em> to rule them as subjects to his will, if he, too, by the same will had only submitted himself as a subject to a more powerful One.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19 [VIII.]&mdash; The Pelagians Misunderstand <q>Seed</q> In Scripture.</h2>

<p>He goes on to say: <q>After a while the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> says again, 'Adam <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Eve his wife; and she bare a son, and he called his name Seth: saying, The Lord has raised me up another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.'</q> He then adds: <q>The Divinity is said to have raised up the seed itself; as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the sexual union was His appointment.</q> This person did not understand what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> records; for he supposed that the reason why it is said, The Lord has raised me up another seed instead of Abel, was none other than that God might be supposed to have excited in him a desire for sexual intercourse, by means whereof seed might be raised for being poured into the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> womb. He was perfectly unaware that what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has said is not <q>Has raised me up seed</q> in the sense he uses, but only as meaning <q>Has given me a son.</q> Indeed, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> did not use the words in question after his sexual intercourse, when he emitted his seed, but after his wife's confinement, in which he received his son by the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For what gratification is there (except perhaps for lascivious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and those who, as the apostle says with prohibition, <q>possess their vessel in the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of concupiscence</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152237"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:5</a></span>) in the mere shedding of seed as the ultimate pleasure of sexual union, unless it is followed by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and proper fruit of marriage&mdash; conception and birth?</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; Original Sin is Derived from the Faulty Condition of Human Seed.</h2>

<p>This, however, I would not say, as implying at all that we must look for some other creator than the supreme and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of either <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed or of man himself who comes from the seed; but as meaning, that the seed would have issued from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being by the quiet and normal <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of his members to his will's command, if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had not preceded. The question now before us does not concern the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed, but its corruption. Now the <em>nature</em> has God for its author; it is from its corruption that original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is derived. If, indeed, the seed had itself no corruption, what means that passage in the Book of Wisdom, <q>Not being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that they were a naughty generation, and that their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> was inbred, and that their cogitation would never be changed; for their seed was accursed from the beginning</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152238"><a href="../bible/wis012.htm#verse10">Wisdom&nbsp;12:10-11</a></span> Now whatever may be the particular application of these words, they are spoken of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. How, then, is the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of every man inbred, and his seed cursed from the beginning, unless it be in respect of the fact, that <q>by one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for in him all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a></q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152239"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> But where is the man whose <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cogitation can never be changed,</q> unless because it cannot be effected by himself, but only by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>; without the assistance of which, what are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, but that which the Apostle Peter says of them, when he describes them as <q>natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152240"><a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:12</a></span> Accordingly, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, in a certain passage, having both conditions in view&mdash;even the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God with which we are born, and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby we are delivered&mdash;says: <q>Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, even as others. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is rich in mercy, for His great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, has quickened us together with Christ; by whose <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we are saved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152241"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;2:3-5</a></span> What, then, is man's <q>natural <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>,</q> and <q>the seed cursed from the beginning;</q> and what are <q>the natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed,</q> and what the <q>by nature children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a></q>? Was this the condition of the nature which was formed in Adam? God forbid! Inasmuch as his pure nature, however, was corrupted in him, it has run on in this condition by natural descent through all, and still is running; so that there is no deliverance for it from this ruin, except by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21 [IX.]&mdash; It is the Good God That Gives Fruitfulness, and the Devil That Corrupts the Fruit.</h2>

<p>What, therefore, is this man's meaning, in the next passage, wherein he says concerning <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> and his sons, that <q>they were blessed, even as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> were; for God said unto them, 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and have dominion over the earth'</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152242"><a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;9:1</a></span> To these words of the Almighty he added some of his own, saying: <q>Now that pleasure, which you would have seem diabolical, was resorted to in the case of the above-mentioned married pairs; and it continued to exist, both in the goodness of its institution and in the blessing attached to it. For there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the following words were addressed to <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> and his sons in reference to their bodily connection with their wives, which had become by this time unalterably fixed by use: 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.'</q> It is unnecessary for us to employ many words in repeating our former argument. The point here in question is the corruption in our nature, whereby its goodness has been depraved, of which corruption the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is the author. That goodness of nature, as it is in itself, the author of which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is not the question we have to consider. Now God has never withdrawn from corrupted and depraved nature His own mercy and goodness, so as to deprive man of fruitfulness, vivacity, and health, as well as the very substance of his mind and body, his senses also and reason, as well as food, and nourishment, and growth. He, moreover, <q>makes His sun to arise on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152243"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> and all that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is from the good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even in the case of those men who will not be delivered from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; Shall We Be Ashamed of What We Do, or of What God Does?</h2>

<p>It is, however, of <em>pleasure</em> that this man spoke in his passage, because pleasure can be even <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>: of carnal concupiscence, or <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, which produces shame, he made no mention. In some subsequent words, however, he uncovered his susceptibility of shame; and he was unable to dissemble what nature herself has prescribed so forcibly. <q>There is also,</q> says he, <q>that statement: 'Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.'</q> Then after these words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he goes on to offer some of his own, saying: <q>That he might express <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in works, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> approached very near to a perilling of modesty.</q> What a confession! How clear and extorted from him by the force of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>! The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, it would seem, to express <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in works, almost imperilled modesty, when he said, <q>They two shall become one flesh;</q> wishing it to be understood of the sexual union of the male and the female. Let the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be alleged, why the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, in expressing the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, should approach so near an imperilling of modesty? Is it then the case that the works of man ought not to produce shame, but must be gloried in at all events, and that the works of God must produce shame? Is it, that in setting forth and expressing the works of God the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> or labour receives no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, but his modesty is imperilled? What, then, was it possible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to do, which it would be a shame for His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> to describe? And, what is a weightier question still, could a man be ashamed of any work which not man, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has made in man? Whereas workmen in all cases strive, with all the labour and diligence in their power, to avoid shame in the works of their own hands. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, however, is, that we are ashamed of that very thing which made those primitive <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings ashamed, when they covered their loins. That is the penalty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; that is the plague and mark of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; that is the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> and very fuel of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; that is the law in our members warring against the law of our mind; that is the rebellion against our own selves, proceeding from our very selves, which by a most righteous retribution is rendered us by our disobedient members. It is this which makes us ashamed, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> ashamed. If it were not so, what could be more ungrateful, more irreligious in us, if in our members we were to suffer confusion of face, not for our own fault or penalty, but because of the works of God?</p>

<h2>Chapter 23 [X.]&mdash; The Pelagians Affirm that God in the Case of Abraham and Sarah Aroused Concupiscence as a Gift from Heaven.</h2>

<p>He has much also to say, though to no purpose, concerning <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Sarah, how they received a son according to the promise; and at last he mentions the word <em>concupiscence.</em> But he does not add the usual phrase, <q>of the flesh,</q> because this is the very thing which causes the shame. Whereas, on account of concupiscence there is sometimes a call for boasting, inasmuch as there is a concupiscence of the spirit against the flesh, <span class="stiki" id="note152244"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> and a concupiscence of wisdom.  Accordingly, he says: <q>Now you have certainly defined as naturally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> this concupiscence which is indispensable for fecundity; whence comes it, therefore, that it is aroused in aged men by the gift of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>? Make it clear then, if you can, that that belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> work, which you see is conferred by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as a gift.</q> He says this, just as if concupiscence of the flesh had been previously wanting in them, and as if God had bestowed it upon them. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it was inherent in this body of death; that fecundity, however, was wanting of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the author; and this was actually given whenever God willed to confer the gift. Be it, however, far from us to affirm, what he thought we meant to say, that Isaac was begotten without the heat of sexual union.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24 [XI.]&mdash; What Covenant of God the New-Born Babe Breaks. What Was the Value of Circumcision.</h2>

<p>But let him inform us how it was that his  <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would be cut off from his people if he had not been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> on the eighth day. How could he have so <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, how so offended <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as to be punished for the neglect of others towards him with so severe a sentence, had there been no original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the case? For thus ran the commandment of God concerning the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of infants: <q>The uncircumcised man-child, whose flesh of his foreskin is not <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> on the eighth day, his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be cut off from his people; because he has broken my covenant.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152247"><a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;17:14</a></span> Let him tell us, if he can, how that child broke God's covenant&mdash;an innocent babe, so far as he was personally concerned, of eight days' age; and yet there is by no means any <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> uttered here by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. The fact is, the covenant of God which he then broke was not this which commanded <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, but that which forbade the tree; when <q>by one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for in him all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152248"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> And in his case the expiation of this was signified by the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the eighth day, that is, by the sacrament of the Mediator who was to be incarnate. For it was through this same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who was to come in the flesh, and was to die for us, and on the third day (which coming after the seventh or <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, was to be the eighth) to rise again, that even <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men were saved of old. For <q>He was delivered for our offenses, and raised again for our justification.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152249"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;4:25</a></span> Ever since <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was instituted among the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which was at that time the sign of the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it availed also to signify the cleansing even in infants of the original and primitive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in like manner from the time of its institution began to be of avail for the renewal of man. Not that there was no justification by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> before <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; for even when he was still in uncircumcision, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was himself justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, being the father of those nations which should also imitate his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note152250"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;4:10-11</a></span> In former times, however, the sacramental <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of justification by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> lay concealed in every mode.

<h2>Chapter 25 [XII.]&mdash; Augustine Not the Deviser of Original Sin.</h2>

<p><q>This sexual connection of bodies,</q> he says, <q>together with the ardour, with the pleasure, with the emission of seed, was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is praiseworthy on its own account, and is therefore to be approved; it, moreover, became sometimes even a great gift to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men.</q> He distinctly and severally repeated the phrases, <q>with ardour,</q> <q>with pleasure,</q> <q>with emission of seed.</q> He did not, however, venture to say, <q>with <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.</q> Why is this, if it be not that he is ashamed to name what he does not blush to praise? A gift, indeed, for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men is the prosperous propagation of children; but not that shame-producing excitement of the members, which our nature would not feel were it in a sound state, although corrupted nature now experiences it. On this account, indeed, it is that he who is born of it requires to be born again, in order that he may be a member of Christ; and that he of whom he is born, even though he be already born again, wants to be freed from that which exists in this body of death by reason of the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now since this is the case, how is it he goes on to say, <q>You must, therefore, of necessity confess that the original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which you had devised is done away with</q>? It was not I who devised the original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> holds from ancient times; but you, who deny it, are undoubtedly an innovating <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. In the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all are in the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power, born in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless they are regenerated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26 [XIII.]&mdash; The Child in No Sense Formed by Concupiscence.</h2>

<p>But as he was speaking of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Sarah, he goes on to say: <q>If, indeed, you were to affirm that the natural use was strong in them, and there was no offspring, my answer will be: Whom the Creator promised, the Creator also gave; the child which is born is not the work of cohabitation, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He, indeed, who made the first man of the dust, fashions all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> out of seed. As, therefore, the dust of the earth, which was taken as the material, was not the author of man; so likewise that power of sexual pleasure which forms and commingles the seminal elements does not complete the entire process of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> making, but rather presents to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, out of the treasures of nature, material with which He vouchsafes to make the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being.</q> Now the whole of this statement of his, except where he says, that the seminal elements are formed and commingled by sexual pleasure, would be correctly expressed by him were he only earnest in making it to defend the catholic sense. To us, however, who are fully aware what he strives to make out of it, he speaks indeed correctly in a perverse manner. The exceptional statement to the general <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which I do not deny belongs to this passage, is untrue for this reason, because the pleasure in question of carnal concupiscence does not form the seminal elements. These are already in the body, and are formed by the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God who created the body itself. They do not receive their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from the libidinous pleasure, but are excited and emitted in company with it. Whether, indeed, such pleasure accompanies the commingling of the seminal elements of the two sexes in the womb, is a question which perhaps <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> may be able to determine from their inmost feelings; but it is improper for us to push an idle curiosity so far. That concupiscence, however, which we have to be ashamed of, and the shame of which has given to our secret members their shameful designation, <em>pudenda</em>, had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in the body during its life in paradise before the entrance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but it began to exist <q>in the body of this death</q> after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the rebellion of the members retaliating man's own disobedience. Without this concupiscence it was quite possible to effect the function of the wedded pair in the procreation of children: just as many a laborious work is accomplished by the compliant operation of our other limbs, without any lascivious heat; for they are simply moved by the direction of the will, not excited by the ardour of concupiscence.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27.&mdash; The Pelagians Argue that God Sometimes Closes the Womb in Anger, and Opens It When Appeased.</h2>

<p>Carefully consider the rest of his remarks: <q>This likewise,</q> says he, is confirmed by the apostle's authority. For when the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> spoke of the resurrection of the dead, he said, <q>You fool, that which you sow is not quickened.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152254"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse36">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:36</a></span> And afterwards, 'But God gives it a body as it pleases Him, and to every seed its own body.' If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, says he, <q>has assigned to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed, as to every thing else, its own proper body, which no wise or <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man will deny, how will you prove that any person is born guilty? Do, I beg of you, reflect with what a noose this assertion of natural <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is choked. But come,</q> he says, <q>deal more gently with yourself, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you. Believe me, God made even you: it must, however, be confessed, that a serious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> has infected you. For what profaner opinion can be broached than that either God did not make man, or else that He made him for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; or, at any rate, that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> framed God's image, that is, man&mdash;which clearly is a statement not more absurd than impious? Is then,</q> says he, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so poor in resources, so lacking in all sense of propriety, as not to have had anything which He could confer on <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men as their reward, except what the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, after making them his dupes, might infuse into them for their vitiation?  Would you like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, however, that even in the case of those who are no <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, God can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have bestowed this power of procreation of children? When <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, struck with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> among a foreign nation, said that Sarah, his wife, was his sister, it is said that Abimelech, the king of the country, abducted her for a night's enjoyment of her. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who had the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in His keeping, appeared to Abimelech in his sleep, and restrained the royal audacity; threatening him with death if he went to the length of violating the wife. Then Abimelech said: 'Will you, O Lord, slay an innocent and righteous nation? Did they not tell me that they were brother and sister? Therefore Abimelech  arose early in the morning, and took a thousand pieces of silver, and sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and women-servants, and gave them to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and sent away his wife untouched. But <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> unto God for Abimelech; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants.'</q>  Now why he narrated all this at so great a length, you may find in these few words which he added: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> he says, <q>at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, restored their potency of generation, which had been taken away from the wombs of even the meanest servants; because God had closed up every womb in the house of Abimelech. <span class="stiki" id="note152257"><a href="../bible/gen020.htm#verse18">Genesis&nbsp;20:18</a></span> Consider now,</q> says he, <q>whether that ought to be called a natural <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which sometimes God when <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> takes away, and when appeased restores. He,</q> says he, <q>makes the children both of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and of the ungodly, inasmuch as the circumstance of their being <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> appertains to that nature which rejoices in God as its Author, while the fact of their impiety belongs to the depravity of their desires, and this comes to every person whatever as the consequence of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 28 [XIV.]&mdash; Augustine's Answer to This Argument. Its Dealing with Scripture.</h2>

<p>Now to this lengthy statement of his we have to say in answer, that, in the passages which he has quoted from the sacred writings, there is nothing said about that shameful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, which we say did not exist in the body of our first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in their blessedness, when they were naked and were not ashamed. <span class="stiki" id="note152258"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse25">Genesis&nbsp;2:25</a></span> The first passage from the apostle was spoken of the seeds of grain, which first die in order to be quickened. For some reason or other, he was unwilling to complete the verse for his quotation. All he adduces from it is: <q>You fool, that which you sow is not quickened;</q> but the apostle adds, <q>except it die.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152259"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse36">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:36</a></span> This writer, however, so far as I can judge, wished this passage, which treats only of grain seeds, to be understood of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed, by such as read it without either understanding the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> or recollecting them. Indeed, he not merely curtailed this particular sentence, by omitting the clause, <q>except it die,</q> but he omitted the following words, in which the apostle explained of what seeds he was speaking; for the apostle adds: <q>And that which you sow, you sow not that body which shall be, but the bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152260"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse37">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:37</a></span> This he omitted, and closed up his context with what the apostle then writes: <q>But God gives it a body as it has pleased Him, and to every seed its own body;</q> just as if the apostle spoke of man in cohabitation when he said, <q>You fool, that which you sow is not quickened,</q> with a view to our understanding of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed, that it is quickened by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not by man in cohabitation begetting children. For he had previously said: <q>Sexual pleasure does not complete the entire process of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> making, but rather presents to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, out of the treasures of nature, material with which He vouchsafes to make the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being.</q>  He then added the quotation, as if the apostle affirmed as follows: You fool, that which you sow is not quickened&mdash;quickened, that is, by yourself; but God forms the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being out of your seed. As if the apostle had not said the intermediate words, which this writer chose to pass over; and as if the apostle's aim was to speak of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed thus: <q>You fool, that which you sow is not quickened; but God gives to the seed a body such as pleases Him, and to every seed its own body.</q> Indeed, after the apostle's words, he introduces remarks of his own to this effect: <q>If, therefore, God has assigned to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed, as to everything else, its own proper body, which no wise or <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man will deny;</q> quite as if the apostle in the passage in question spoke of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29.&mdash; The Same Continued. Augustine Also Asserts that God Forms Man at Birth.</h2>

<p>Though I have given special attention to the point, I have failed to discover what assistance he could obtain from this deceitful use of Scripture, except that he wanted to produce the apostle as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and by him to prove, what we also assert, that God forms man of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed. And inasmuch as no passage directly occurred to him, he deceitfully manipulated this particular one; fearing no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that, if the apostle should chance to seem to have spoken of grain seeds, and not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, in this passage, we should have suggested to us at once by such procedure of his, how to refute him: not indeed as the pure-minded advocate of a chastened will, but as the impudent proclaimer of a profligate voluptuousness. But from the very seeds, forsooth, which the farmers sow in their fields he can be refuted. For why can we not suppose that God could have granted to man in his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> state in paradise, the same course with regard to his own seed which we see granted to the seeds of grain, in such wise that the former might be sown without any shameful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, the members of generation simply <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> the inclination of the will; just as the latter is sown without any shameful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, the hands of the husbandman merely moving in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to his will? There being, indeed, this difference, that the desire of begetting children in the parent is a nobler one than that which characterizes the farmer, of filling his barns. Then, again, why might not the almighty Creator, with His incontaminable ubiquity, and his power of creating from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed just what it pleased Him, have operated in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, with respect to what He even now makes, in the self-same manner as He operates in the ground with grain seeds according to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, making blessed mothers conceive without lustful passion, and bring forth children without parturient pains, inasmuch as there was not (in that state of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and in the body which was not as yet the body of this death, but rather of that life) in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> when receiving seed anything to produce shame, as there was nothing when giving birth to offspring to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pain? Whoever refuses to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this, or is unwilling to have it supposed that, while men previous to any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> lived in that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> state of paradise, such a condition as that which we have sketched could not have been permitted in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and kindness, must be regarded as the lover of shameful pleasure, rather than the encomiast of desirable fecundity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30 [XV.]&mdash; The Case of Abimelech and His House Examined.</h2>

<p>Then, again, as to the passage which he has adduced from the inspired history concerning Abimelech, and God's choosing to close up every womb in his household that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> should not bear children, and afterwards opening them that they might become fruitful, what is all this to the point? What has it to do with that shameful concupiscence which is now the question in dispute? Did <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, deprive those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of this feeling, and give it to them again just when He liked? The punishment however, was that they were unable to bear children, and the blessing that they were able to bear them, after the manner of this corruptible flesh. For God would not confer such a blessing upon this body of death, as only that body of life in paradise could have had before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered; that is, the process of conceiving without the prurience of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and of bearing children without excruciating pain. But why should we not suppose, since, indeed, <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says that every womb was closed, that this took place with something of pain, so that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were unable to bear cohabitation, and that God inflicted this pain in His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and removed it in His mercy? For if <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> was to be taken away as an impediment to begetting offspring, it ought to have been taken away from the men, not from the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> might perform her share in cohabitation by her will, even if the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> ceased by which she is stimulated, provided it were not absent from the man for exciting him; unless, perhaps (as Scripture informs us that even Abimelech himself was healed), he would tell us that virile concupiscence was restored to him. If, however, it were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that he had lost this, what necessity was there that he should be warned by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to hold no connection with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> wife? The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, Abimelech is said to have been healed, because his household was cured of the affliction which smote it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31 [XVI.]&mdash; Why God Proceeds to Create Human Beings, Who He Knows Will Be Born in Sin.</h2>

<p>Let us now look at those three clauses of his, than which three, he says, nothing more profane could possibly be uttered: <q>Either God did not make man, or else He made him for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; or, at any rate, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> framed God's image, that is, man.</q> Now, the first and the last of these sentences, even he himself must allow, if he be not reckless and perverse, were never uttered by us. The dispute is confined to that which he puts second between the other two. In respect of this, he is so far mistaken as to suppose that we had said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made man for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; as if, in the case of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings whom God creates of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, His care and purpose and provision were, that by means of His workmanship the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> should have as slaves those whom he is unable to make for himself. God forbid that any sort of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> belief, however childish, should ever entertain such a sentiment as this! Of His own goodness God has made man&mdash; the first without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, all others under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash; for the purposes of His own profound thoughts. For just as He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> full well what to do with reference to the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself, and what He does is just and good, however <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> he is, about whom He takes His measures; and just as He was not unwilling to create him because He foresaw that he would be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; so in regard to the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, though not a man of it is born without the taint of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He who is supremely good Himself is always working out good, making some men, as it were, <q>vessels of mercy,</q> whom <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> distinguishes from those who are <q>vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>;</q> while He makes others, as it were, <q>vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>,</q> that He may make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the riches of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> towards the vessels of mercy. <span class="stiki" id="note152262"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;9:23</a></span> Let, then, this objector go and contest the point against the apostle, whose words I use; nay, against the very Potter, whom the apostle forbids us answering again, in the well-known words: <q>Who are you, O man, that repliest against God! Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why have  you made me like this? Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and another unto dishonour?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152263"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;9:20-21</a></span> Well now, will this man contend that the vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> are not under the dominion of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? Or else, because they are under this dominion, are they made by another creator than He who makes the vessels of mercy? Or does He make them of other material, and not out of the self-same lump? Here, then, he may object, and say: <q>Therefore God makes these vessels for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> As if God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not how to make such a use of even these for the furtherance of His own good and righteous works, as He makes of the very <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32 [XVII.]&mdash; God Not the Author of the Evil in Those Whom He Creates.</h2>

<p>Then, does God feed the children of perdition, the goats on His left hand, <span class="stiki" id="note152264"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;25:33</a></span> for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and nourish and clothe them for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <q>because He makes His sun to rise on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and the good, and sends rain upon the just and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a></q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152265"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> He creates, then, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> just in the same way as He feeds and nourishes the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; because what He bestows on them by creating them appertains to the goodness of nature; and the growth which He gives them by food and nourishment, He bestows on them, of course, as a kindly help, not to their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> character, but to that same good nature which He in His goodness created. For in as far as they are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings&mdash; this is a good of that nature whose author and maker is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but in as far as they are born with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and so destined to perdition unless they are born again, they belong to the seed which was cursed from the beginning, <span class="stiki" id="note152266"><a href="../bible/wis012.htm#verse11">Wisdom&nbsp;12:11</a></span> by the fault of the primitive disobedience. This fault, however, is turned to good account by the Maker of even the vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, that He may make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the riches of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on the vessels of mercy: <span class="stiki" id="note152267"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse33">Romans&nbsp;9:33</a></span> and that no one may attribute to any merits of his own, pertaining as he does to the self-same mass, his deliverance through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but <q>he that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a>, let him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152268"><a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:17</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 33 [XVIII.]&mdash; Though God Makes Us, We Perish Unless He Re-makes Us in Christ.</h2>

<p>From this most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and firmly-established principle of the apostolic and catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the writer before us departs in company with the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>. He will not have it that men are born under the dominion of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, lest infants be carried to Christ to be delivered from the power of darkness, and to be translated into His kingdom. <span class="stiki" id="note152269"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse13">Colossians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> Thus he becomes the accuser of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is spread over the world; into this Church everywhere infants, when to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, are first exorcised, for no other reason than that the prince of this world may be cast out <span class="stiki" id="note152270"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;12:31</a></span> of them. For by him must they be necessarily possessed, as vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, since they are born of Adam, unless they be born again in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and transferred through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as vessels of mercy into His kingdom. In his attack, however, upon this most firmly-established <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he would avoid the appearance of an assault upon the entire Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Accordingly, he limits his appeal to me alone, and in the tone of reproof and admonition he says: <q>But God made even you, though it must be confessed that a serious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> has infected you.</q> Well now, I thankfully acknowledge that God did make even me; and still I must have perished with the vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, if He had only made me of Adam, and had not re-made me in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Possessed, however, as this man is with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Pelagius, he does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this: if, indeed, he persists in so great an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to the very end, then not he, but <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, will be able to see the character and extent of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which has not simply infected, but absolutely destroyed  him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34 [XIX.]&mdash; The Pelagians Argue that Cohabitation Rightly Used is a Good, and What is Born from It is Good.</h2>

<p>I request your attention now to the following words. He says, <q>That children, however, who are conceived in wedlock are by nature good, we may learn from the apostle's words, when he speaks of men who, leaving the natural use of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, burned in their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, men with men working together that which is disgraceful. <span class="stiki" id="note152272"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse27">Romans&nbsp;1:27</a></span> Here,</q> says he, <q>the apostle shows the use of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to be both natural and, in its way, laudable; the abuse consisting in the exercise of one's own will in opposition to the decent use of the institution. Deservedly then,</q> says he, <q>in those who make a right use thereof, concupiscence is commended in its kind and mode; while the excess of it, in which abandoned <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> indulge, is punished. Indeed, at the very time when God punished the abuse in <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> with His judgment of fire, He invigorated the generative powers of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Sarah, which had become impotent through old age.  If, therefore,</q> he goes on to say, <q>you think that fault must be found with the strength of the generative organs, because the Sodomites were steeped in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> thereby, you will have also to censure such <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things as bread and wine, since <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> informs us that they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> also in the abuse of these gifts. For the Lord, by the mouth of His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Ezekiel, says: 'These, moreover, were the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of your sister <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>; in their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, she and her children overflowed in fullness of bread and abundance of wine; and they helped not the hand of the poor and needy.' <span class="stiki" id="note152274"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse49">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:49</a></span> Choose, therefore,</q> says he, <q>which alternative you would rather have: either impute to the work of God the sexual connection of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies, or account such <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things as bread and wine to be equally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But if you should prefer this latter conclusion, you prove yourself to be a Manichean. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, however, is this: he who observes moderation in natural concupiscence uses a good thing well; but he who does not observe moderation, abuses a good thing. What means your statement, then,</q>  he asks, <q>when you say that 'the good of marriage is no more impeachable on account of the original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is derived herefrom, than the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and fornication can be excused because of the natural good which is born of them'? In these words,</q> says he, <q>you conceded what you had denied, and what you had conceded you nullified; and you aim at nothing so much as to be unintelligible. Show me any bodily marriage without sexual connection. Else impose some one name on this operation, and designate the conjugal union as either a good or an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. You answer, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that you have already defined marriages to be good. Well then, if marriage is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>&mdash;if the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being is the good fruit of marriage; if this fruit, being God's work, cannot be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, born as it is by good agency out of good&mdash;where is the original <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which has been set aside by so many prior admissions?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 35 [XX.]&mdash; He Answers the Arguments of Julianus. What is the Natural Use of the Woman? What is the Unnatural Use?</h2>

<p>My answer to this challenge is, that not only the children of wedlock, but also those of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, are a good work in so far as they are the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whom they are created: but as concerns original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, they are all born under condemnation of the first Adam; not only those who are born in <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, but likewise such as are born in wedlock, unless they be regenerated in the second Adam, which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. As to what the apostle says of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, that <q>leaving the natural use of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, the men burned in their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> one toward another: men with men working that which is unseemly;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152276"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse27">Romans&nbsp;1:27</a></span> he did not speak of the conjugal use, but the <q>natural use,</q> wishing us to understand how it comes to pass that by means of the members created for the purpose the two sexes can combine for generation. Thus it follows, that even when a man unites with a harlot to use these members, the use is a natural one. It is not, however, commendable, but rather culpable. But as regards any part of the body which is not meant for generative purposes, should a man use even his own wife in it, it is against nature and flagitious. Indeed, the same apostle had previously <span class="stiki" id="note152277"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse26">Romans&nbsp;9:26</a></span> said concerning <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: <q>Even their <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> did change the natural use into that which is against nature;</q> and then concerning men he added, that they worked that which is unseemly by leaving the natural use of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Therefore, by the phrase in question, <q>the natural use,</q> it is not meant to praise conjugal connection; but thereby are denoted those flagitious <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which are more unclean and criminal than even men's use of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, which, even if unlawful, is nevertheless natural.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36 [XXI.]&mdash; God Made Nature Good: the Saviour Restores It When Corrupted.</h2>

<p>Now we do not reprehend bread and wine because some men are luxurious and drunkards, any more than we disapprove of gold because of the greedy and avaricious. Wherefore on the same principle we do not censure the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> connection between husband and wife, because of the shame-causing <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of bodies. For the former would have been quite possible before any antecedent commission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and by it the united pair would not have been made to blush; whereas the latter arose after the perpetration of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and they were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to hide it, from very shame. <span class="stiki" id="note152278"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;3:7</a></span> Accordingly, in all united pairs ever since, however well and lawfully they have used this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, there has been a permanent necessity of avoiding the sight of man in any work of this kind, and thus acknowledging what caused inevitable shame, though a good thing would certainly <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> no man to be ashamed. In this way we have two distinct facts insensibly introduced to our notice: the good of that laudable union of the sexes for the purpose of generating children; and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of that shameful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, in consequence of which the offspring must be regenerated in order to escape condemnation. The man, therefore, who, though with the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> which causes shame, joins in lawful cohabitation, turns an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to good account; whereas he who joins in an unlawful cohabitation uses an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> badly; for that is more correctly called <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than good, at which both bad and good alike blush. We do better to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him who has said, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152279"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;7:18</a></span> rather than him who calls that good, by which he is so conformed that he admits it to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but if he feels no shame, he adds the worse <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of impudence. Rightly then did we declare that <q>the good of marriage is no more impeachable because of the original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is derived therefrom, than the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and fornication can be excused, because of the natural good which is born of them:</q> since the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which is born, whether of wedlock or of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now if this nature were an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it ought not to have been born; if it had not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it would not have to be regenerated: and (that I may combine the two cases in one and the same predicate) if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> were an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing, it would not have to be saved; if it had not in it any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it would not have to be saved. He, therefore, who contends that nature is not good, says that the Maker of the creature is not good; while he who will have it, that nature has no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in it, deprives it in its corrupted condition of a merciful Saviour. From this, then, it follows, that in the birth of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings neither fornication is to be excused on account of the good which is formed out of it by the good Creator, nor is marriage to be impeached by reason of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which has to be healed in it by the merciful Saviour.</p>

<h2>Chapter 37 [XXII.]&mdash; If There is No Marriage Without Cohabitation, So There is No Cohabitation Without Shame.</h2>

<p><q>Show me,</q> he says, <q>any bodily marriage without sexual connection.</q> I do not show him any bodily marriage without sexual connection; but then, neither does he show me any case of sexual connection which is without shame. In paradise, however, if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had not preceded, there would not have been, indeed, generation without union of the sexes, but this union would certainly have been without shame; for in the sexual union there would have been a quiet acquiescence of the members, not a <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh productive of shame. Matrimony, therefore, is a good, in which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being is born after orderly conception; the fruit, too, of matrimony is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as being the very <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being which is thus born; <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, however, is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with which every man is born. Now it was God who made and still makes man; but <q>by one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for in him all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152280"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 38 [XXIII.]&mdash; Jovinian Used Formerly to Call Catholics Manicheans; The Arians Also Used to Call Catholics Sabellians.</h2>

<p><q>By your new mode of controversy,</q> says he, <q>you both profess to be a catholic and patronize Manich&aelig;us, inasmuch as you designate matrimony both as a great good and a great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> Now he is utterly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what he says, or pretends to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. Or else he does not understand what we say, or does not wish it to be understood. But if he does not understand, he is impeded by the pre-occupation of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; or if he does not wish our meaning to be understood, then obstinacy is the fault with which he defends his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Jovinian, too, who endeavoured a few years ago to found a new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, used to declare that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> patronized the Manicheans, because in opposition to him they preferred <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> to marriage. But this man is sure to reply, that he does not agree with Jovinian in his indifference about marriage and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. I do not myself say that this is their opinion; still these new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> must allow, by the fact of Jovinian's playing off the Manicheans upon the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, that the expedient is not a novel one. We then declare that marriage is a good, not an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But just as the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> charge us with being Sabellians, although we do not say that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are one and the same, as the Sabellians hold; but affirm that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> have one and the same nature, as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: so do the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> cast the Manicheans in our teeth, although we do not declare marriage to be an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as the Manicheans pretend, but affirm that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> accrued to the first man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, that is to say, to the first married pair, and from them passed on to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> hold. As, however, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, while avoiding the Sabellians, fall into worse company, because they have had the audacity to divide not the Persons of the Trinity, but the natures; so the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, in their efforts to escape from the pestilent <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the Manicheans, by taking the opposite extreme, are convicted of entertaining worse sentiments than the Manicheans themselves touching the fruit of matrimony, inasmuch as they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that infants stand in no need of Christ as their Physician.</p>

<h2>Chapter 39 [XXIV.]&mdash; Man Born of Whatever Parentage is Sinful and Capable of Redemption.</h2>

<p>He then says: <q>You conclude that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, if born of fornication, is not guilty; and if born in wedlock, is not innocent. Your assertion, therefore, amounts to this, that natural good may possibly subsist from adulterous connections, while original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is actually derived from marriage.</q> Well now, he here attempts, but in vain before an intelligent reader, to give a wrong turn to words which are correct enough. Far be it from us to say, that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, if born in fornication, is not guilty. But we do affirm, that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, whether he be born in wedlock or in fornication, is in some respect good, because of the Author of nature, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; we add, however, that he derives some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by reason of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Our statement, therefore, <q>that natural good can subsist even from adulterous parentage, but that original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is derived even from marriage,</q> does not amount to what he endeavours to make of it, that one born in <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> is not guilty, nor innocent when born in wedlock; but that one who is generated in either condition is guilty, because of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and that the offspring of either state may be freed by regeneration, because of the good of nature.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40 [XXV.]&mdash; Augustine Declines the Dilemma Offered Him.</h2>

<p><q>One of these propositions,</q> says he, <q>is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the other false.</q> My reply is as brief as the allegation: Both are really <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, neither is false. <q>It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>,</q> he goes on to say, <q>that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> cannot be excused by reason of the man who is born of it; inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which adulterers commit, pertains to corruption of the will; but the offspring which they produce tends to the praise of fecundity. If one were to sow wheat which had been stolen, the crop which springs up is none the worse. Of course,</q> says he, <q>I blame the thief, but I praise the grain. So I pronounce him innocent who is born of the generous fruitfulness of the seed; even as the apostle puts it: 'God gives it a body, as it pleases Him; and to every seed its own body;' <span class="stiki" id="note152281"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse38">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:38</a></span> but, at the same time, I condemn the flagitious man who has committed his adulterous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in his perverse use of the divine appointment.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 41 [XXVI.]&mdash; The Pelagians Argue that Original Sin Cannot Come Through Marriage If Marriage is Good.</h2>

<p>After this he proceeds with the following words: <q>Certainly if <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is contracted from marriage, it may be blamed, nay, cannot be excused; and you place under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power its work and fruit, because everything which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is itself without good. The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, however, who is born of wedlock owes his origin not to the reproaches of wedlock, but to its seminal elements: the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of these, however, lies in the condition of bodies; and whosoever makes a bad use of these bodies, deals a blow at the good desert thereof, not at their nature. It is therefore clear,</q> argues he, <q>that the good is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. If, therefore,</q> he continues, <q>original <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is derived even from marriage, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the compact of marriage; and that must needs be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by which and from which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit has made its appearance; even as the Lord says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: 'A tree is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by its fruits.' <span class="stiki" id="note152282"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;7:16</a></span> How then,</q> he asks, <q>do you think yourself worthy of attention, when you say that marriage is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and yet declare that nothing but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> proceeds from it? It is evident, then, that marriages are guilty, since original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is deduced from them; and they are indefensible, too, unless their fruit be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> innocent. But they are defended, and pronounced good; therefore their fruit is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be innocent.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 42.&mdash; The Pelagians Try to Get Rid of Original Sin by Their Praise of God's Works; Marriage, in Its Nature and by Its Institution, is Not the Cause of Sin.</h2>

<p>I have an answer ready for all this; but before I give it, I wish the reader carefully to notice, that the result of the opinions of these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is, that no Saviour is necessary for infants, whom they deem to be entirely without any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to be saved from. This vast perversion of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so hostile to God's great <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is given through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who <q>came to seek and to save what was lost,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152283"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;19:10</a></span> tries to insinuate its way into the hearts of the unintelligent by eulogizing the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that is, by its eulogy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed, of marriage, of sexual intercourse, of the fruits of matrimony&mdash; which are all of them <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. I will not say that he adds the praise of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; because he too is ashamed even to name it, so that it is something else, and not <em>it</em>, which he seems to praise. By this method of his, not distinguishing between the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which have accrued to nature and the goodness of nature's very self, he does not, indeed, show it to be sound (because that is untrue), but he does not permit its diseased condition to be healed. And, therefore, that first proposition of ours, to the effect that the good thing, even the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, which is born of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, does not excuse the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of adulterous connection, he allows to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and this point, which occasions no question to arise between us, he even defends and strengthens (as he well may) by his similitude of the thief who sows the seed which he stole, and out of which there arises a really good harvest. Our other proposition, however, that <q>the good of marriage cannot be blamed for the original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is derived from it,</q> he will not admit to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; if, indeed, he assented to it, he would not be a Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, but a catholic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. <q>Certainly,</q> says he, <q>if <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> arises from marriage, it may be blamed, nay, cannot be excused; and you place its work and fruit under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power, because everything which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is itself without good.</q> And in addition to this, he contrived other arguments to show that good could not possibly be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and from this he drew the inference, that marriage, which is a good, is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and that consequently from it no man could be born in a sinful state, and having need of a Saviour: just as if we said that marriage is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, though it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being which is born in wedlock is not born without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Marriage was instituted not for the purpose of sinning, but of producing children. Accordingly the Lord's blessing on the married state ran thus: <q>Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152284"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, however, which is derived to children from marriage does not belong to marriage, but to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which accrues to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> agents, from whose union marriage comes into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">being</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, both the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of shameful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> can exist without marriage, and marriage might have been without it. It appertains, however, to the condition of the body (not of that life, but) of this death, that marriage cannot exist without it though it may exist without marriage. Of course that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh which causes shame has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> out of the married state, whenever it urges men to the commission of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, chambering and uncleanness, so utterly hostile to the purity of marriage; or again, when it does not commit any of these things, because the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> agent gives no permission or assent to their commission, but still rises and is set in motion and creates disturbance, and (especially in dreams) effects the likeness of its own veritable work, and reaches the end of its own emotion. Well, now, this is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is not even in the married state actually an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of marriage; but it has this apparatus all ready in the body of this death, even against its own will, which is indispensable no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> for the accomplishment of that which it does will. The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in question, therefore, does not accrue to marriage from its own institution, which was blessed; but entirely from the circumstance that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world by one man, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for in him all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note152285"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 43.&mdash; The Good Tree in the Gospel that Cannot Bring Forth Evil Fruit, Does Not Mean Marriage.</h2>

<p>What, then, does he mean by saying, <q>A tree is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by its fruits,</q> on the ground of our reading that the Lord spoke thus in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>? Was, then, the Lord speaking of this question in these words, and not rather of men's two wills, the good and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, calling one of these the good tree, and the other the corrupt tree, inasmuch as good works spring out of a good will, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ones out of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will&mdash; the converse being impossible, good works out of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ones out of a good will? If, however, we were to suppose marriage to be the good tree, according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> simile which he has mentioned, then, of course, we must on the other hand assume fornication to be the corrupt tree. Wherefore, if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being is said to be the fruit of marriage, in the sense of the good fruit of a good tree, then undoubtedly a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being could never have been born in fornication. <q>For a corrupt tree brings not forth good fruit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152286"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;7:18</a></span> Once more, if he were to say that not <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> must be supposed to occupy the place of the tree, but rather <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, of which man is born, then in this way not even marriage can stand for the tree, but only the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of which man is born. His simile, therefore, taken from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> avails him nothing in elucidating this question, because marriage is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is transmitted in the natural birth, and atoned for in the new birth; but the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> transgression of the first man is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <q>You repeat,</q> says he, <q>your allegation, 'Just as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, from whatever source it is derived to infants, is the work of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, so man, howsoever he be born, is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.'</q> Yes, I said this, and most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> too; and if this man were not a Pelagian, but a catholic, he too would have nothing else to avow in the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 44 [XXVII.]&mdash; The Pelagians Argue that If Sin Comes by Birth, All Married People Deserve Condemnation.</h2>

<p>What, then, is his object when he inquires of us, <q>By what means <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be found in an infant, through the will, or through marriage, or through its <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a></q>? He speaks, indeed, in such a way as if he had an answer to all these questions, and as if by clearing all of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> together he would have nothing remain in the infant whence <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> could be found. I beg your attention to his very words: <q>Through what,</q> says he, <q>is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> found in an infant? Through the will? But there has never been one in him? Through marriage? But this appertains to the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> work, of whom you had previously declared that in this action they had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; though it appears from your subsequent words that you did not make this concession <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>. Marriage, therefore,</q> he says, <q>must be condemned, since it furnished the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Yet marriage only indicates the work of personal agents. The <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, therefore, who by their coming together afforded occasion for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are properly deserving  of the condemnation. It does not then admit of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>,</q> says he, <q>any longer, if we are to follow your opinion, that married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are handed over to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, it being by their means brought about that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has come to exercise dominion over men. And what becomes of what you just before had said, that man was the work of God? Because if through their birth it happens that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is in men, and through the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has power over men, so in fact you declare the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to be the author of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, from whom comes their origin at birth. If, however, you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that man is made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that husband and wife are innocent, see how impossible is your standpoint, that original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is derived from them.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 45.&mdash; Answer to This Argument: The Apostle Says We All Sinned in One.</h2>

<p>Now, there is an answer for him to all these questions given by the apostle, who censures neither the infant's will, which is not yet matured in him for sinning, nor marriage, which, as such, has not only its institution, but its blessing also, from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, so far as they are <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, who are united together properly and lawfully for the procreation of children; but he says, <q>By one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for in him all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152287"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> Now, if these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> would only receive this statement with catholic hearts and ears, they would not have rebellious feelings against the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor would they vainly endeavour to convert to their own particular and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> sense these very clear and manifest words of the apostle, when they assert that the purport of the passage is to this effect: that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was the first to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and that any one who wished afterwards to commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> found an example for sinning in him; so that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, you must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, did not pass from this one upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by birth, but by the imitation of this one. Whereas it is certain that if the apostle meant this imitation to be here understood, he would have said that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had entered into the world and passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not by one man, but rather by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> it is written: <q>They that are on his side do imitate him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152288"><a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse24">Wisdom&nbsp;2:24</a></span> He used the phrase <q>by one man,</q> from whom the generation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, of course, had its beginning, in order to show us that original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by generation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 46.&mdash; The Reign of Death, What It Is; The Figure of the Future Adam; How All Men are Justified Through Christ.</h2>

<p>But what else is meant even by the apostle's subsequent words? For after he had said the above, he added, <q>For until the law <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was in the world,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152289"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;5:13</a></span> as much as to say that not even the law was able to take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <q>But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> adds he, <q>was not imputed when there was no law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152290"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;5:13</a></span> It <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> then, but was not imputed, for it was not set forth so that it might be imputed. It is on the same principle, indeed, that he says in another passage: <q>By the law is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152291"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;3:20</a></span> <q>Nevertheless,</q> says he, <q>death reigned from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152292"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;5:14</a></span> that is, as he had already expressed it, <q>until the law.</q> Not that there was no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but because even the law, which was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, was unable to deprive death of its power, which, of course, reigns only by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Its reign, too, is such as to plunge mortal man even into that second death which is to endure for evermore. <q>Death reigned,</q> but over whom? <q>Even over them that had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of Him that was to come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152293"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;5:14</a></span> Of whom that was to come, if not Christ? And in what sort a figure, except in the way of contrariety? Which he elsewhere briefly expresses: <q>As in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152294"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:22</a></span> The one condition was in one, even as the other condition was in the other; this is the figure. But this figure is not conformable in every respect; accordingly the apostle, following up the same idea, added, <q>But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead; much more the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the gift by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is by one man, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, has abounded unto many.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152295"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;5:15</a></span> But why <q>has it much more abounded,</q> except it be that all who are delivered through Christ suffer temporal death on Adam's account, but have everlasting life in store for the sake of Christ Himself? <q>And not as it was by one that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>,</q> says he, <q>so is the gift: for the judgment was from one to condemnation, but the free gift is from many offenses unto justification.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152296"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;5:15</a></span> <q>By one</q> what, but offense? Since it is added, <q>the free gift is from many offenses.</q> Let these objectors tell us how it can be <q>by one offense unto condemnation,</q> unless it be that even the one original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which has passed over unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is sufficient for condemnation? Whereas the free gift delivers from many offenses to justification, because it not only cancels the one offense, which is derived from the primal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but all others also which are added in every individual man by the motion of his own will. <q>For if by one man's offense death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and righteousness shall reign in life by One, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Therefore, by the offense of one upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to condemnation; so by the righteousness of one upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> unto justification of life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152297"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;5:17-18</a></span> Let them after this persist in their vain imaginations, and maintain that one man did not hand on <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by propagation, but only set the example of committing it. How is it, then, that by one's offense judgment comes on all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to condemnation, and not rather by each man's own numerous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, unless it be that even if there were but that one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is sufficient, without the addition of any more, to lead to condemnation&mdash;as, indeed, it does lead all who die in infancy who are born of Adam, without being born again in Christ? Why, then, does he, when he refuses to hear the apostle, ask us for an answer to his question, <q>By what means may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be discovered in an infant&mdash;through the will, or through marriage, or through its <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>?</q> Let him listen in silence, and hear by what means <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may be discovered in an infant. <q>By the offense of one,</q> says the apostle, <q>upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to condemnation.</q> He said, moreover, all to condemnation through Adam, and all to justification through Christ: not, of course, that Christ removes to life all those who die in Adam; but he said <q>all</q> and <q>all,</q> because, as without <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> no one goes to death, so without Christ no man to life. Just as we say of a teacher of letters, when he is alone in a town: This man teaches all their learning; not because all the inhabitants take lessons, but because no man who learns at all is taught by any but him. Indeed, the apostle afterwards designates as <em>many</em> those whom he had previously described as <em>all</em>, meaning the self-same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> by the two different terms. <q>For,</q> says he, <q>as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of one shall many be made righteous.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152298"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;5:19</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 47.&mdash; The Scriptures Repeatedly Teach Us that All Sin in One.</h2>

<p>Still let him ply his question: <q>By what means may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be discovered in an infant?</q> He may find an answer in the inspired pages: <q>By one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for in him all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q> <q>Through the offense of one many are dead.</q> <q>The judgment was from one to condemnation.</q> <q>By one man's offense death reigned by one.</q> <q>By the offense of one, Judgment came upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to condemnation.</q> <q>By one man's disobedience many were made sinners.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152299"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12-19</a></span> Behold, then, <q>by what means <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be discovered in an infant.</q> Let him now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; let him permit infants to come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that they may be saved. [XXVIII.] What means this passage of his: <q>He <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not who is born; he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not who begot him; He <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not who created him. Amidst these intrenchments of innocence, therefore, what are the breaches through which you pretend that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered?</q> Why does he search for a hidden chink when he has an open door? <q>By one man,</q> says the apostle; <q>through the offense of one,</q> says the apostle; <q>By one man's disobedience,</q> says the apostle. What does he want more? What does he require plainer? What does he expect to be more impressively repeated?</p>

<h2>Chapter 48.&mdash; Original Sin Arose from Adam's Depraved Will. Whence the Corrupt Will Sprang.</h2>

<p><q>If,</q> says he, <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> comes from the will, it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will that causes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; if it comes from nature, then nature is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> I at once answer, Sin does come from the will. Perhaps he wants to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, whether original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> also? I answer, most certainly original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> also. Because it, too, was engendered from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the first man; so that it both <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in him, and passed on to all. As for what he next proposes, <q>If it comes from nature, then nature is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> I request him to answer, if he can, to this effect: As it is manifest that all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works spring from a corrupt will, like the fruits of a corrupt tree; so let him say whence arose the corrupt will itself&mdash; the corrupt tree which yields the corrupt fruits. If from an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, what was the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but the good work of God? If from man, what was even he, but the good work of God? Nay, inasmuch as the corrupt will arose in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and in man from man, what were both these, previous to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> arising within them, but the good work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with a good and laudable nature? Behold, then, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> arises out of good; nor was there any other source, indeed, whence it could arise, but out of good. I call that will bad which no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has preceded; no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works, of course, since they only proceed from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will, as from a corrupt tree. Nevertheless, that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will arose out of good, could not be, because that good was made by the good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but because it was created out of nothing&mdash; not out of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What, therefore, becomes of his argument, <q>If nature is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it will never do for the work of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to permeate the work of God</q>? Did not the work of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, I ask, arise in a work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when it first arose in that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who became the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? Well, then, if <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which was absolutely nowhere previously, could arise in a work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why could not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which had by this time found an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> somewhere, pervade the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; especially when the apostle uses the very expression in the passage, <q>And so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a></q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152300"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> Can it be that men are not the work of God? Sin, therefore, has passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>&mdash; in other words, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> work has penetrated the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; or putting the same meaning in another shape, The work done by a work of God has pervaded God's work. And this is the reason why God alone has an unchangeable and almighty goodness: even before any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> He made all things good; and out of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which have arisen in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which He has made, He works through all for good.</p>

<h2>Chapter 49 [XXIX.]&mdash; In Infants Nature is of God, and the Corruption of Nature of the Devil.</h2>

<p><q>In a single man rightly is the intention blamed and the origin praised; because there must be two things to admit of contraries: in an infant, however, there is but one thing, nature only; because will has no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in his case. Now this one thing,</q> says he, <q>is ascribable either to God or to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. If nature,</q> he goes on to observe, <q>is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there cannot be original <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in it. If of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, there will be nothing on the ground of which man may be vindicated for the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So that he is completely a Manichean who maintains original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> Let him hear rather what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in opposition to all this. In a single man the will is to be blamed, and his nature to be praised; because there should be two things for the application of contraries. Still, even in an infant, it is not the case that there is but one thing only, that is, the nature in which man was created by the good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for he has also that corruption, which has passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by one, as the apostle wisely says, and not as the folly of Pelagius, or C&oelig;lestius, or any of their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> would represent the matter. Of these two things, then, which we have said exist in an infant, one is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. From the fact, however, that (owing to one of the two, even the corruption) both are subjected to the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, there really ensues no incongruity; because this happens not from the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In fact, corruption is subjected to corruption, nature to nature, because the two are even in the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; so that whenever those who are beloved and elect are <q>delivered from the power of darkness</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152301"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse13">Colossians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> to which they are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> exposed, it is clear enough how great a gift is bestowed on the justified and good by the good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who brings good even out of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 50.&mdash; The Rise and Origin of Evil. The Exorcism and Exsufflation of Infants, a Primitive Christian Rite.</h2>

<p>As to the passage, which he seemed to himself to indite in a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> vein, as it were, <q>If nature is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there cannot be original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in it,</q> would not another person seem even to him to give a still more <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> turn to it, thus: <q>If nature is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there cannot arise any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in it?</q> And yet this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. The Manicheans, indeed, meant to assert this, and they endeavoured to steep in all sorts of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> the very nature of God itself, and not His creature, made out of nothing. For <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> arose in nothing else than what was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>&mdash; not, however, the supreme and unchangeable good which is God's nature, but that which was made out of nothing by the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This, then, is the reason why man is claimed for a divine work; for he would not be man unless he were made by the operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> would not exist in infants, if <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> had not been committed by the wilfulness of the first man, and original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> derived from a nature thus corrupted. It is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, then, as he puts it, <q>He is completely a Manichean who maintains original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q> but rather, he is completely a Pelagian who does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is not simply from the time when the pestilent opinions of Manich&aelig;us began to grow that in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> infants about to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> were for the first time exorcised with exsufflation,&mdash; which ceremonial was intended to show that they were not removed into the kingdom of Christ without first being delivered from the power of darkness; <span class="stiki" id="note152302"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse13">Colossians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> nor is it in the books of Manich&aelig;us that we read how <q>the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> come to seek and to save that which was lost,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152303"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;19:10</a></span> or how <q>by one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152304"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> with those other similar passages which we have quoted above; or how God <q>visits the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the fathers upon the children;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152305"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse5">Exodus&nbsp;20:5</a></span> or how it is written in the Psalm, <q>I was shapen in iniquity, and in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> did my mother conceive me;</q>  or again, how <q>man was made like vanity: his days pass away like a shadow;</q>  or again, <q>behold, You have made my days old, and my <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as nothing before You; nay, every man living is altogether vanity;</q>  or how the apostle says, <q>every creature was made subject to vanity;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152309"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;8:20</a></span> or how it is written in the book of Ecclesiastes, <q>vanity of vanities; all is vanity: what profit has a man of all his labour which he takes under the sun?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152310"><a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#verse2">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;1:2-3</a></span> and in the book of Ecclesiasticus, <q>a heavy yoke is upon the sons of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> from the day that they go out of their mother's womb to the day that they return to the mother of all things;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152311"><a href="../bible/sir040.htm#verse1">Sirach&nbsp;40:1</a></span> or how again the apostle writes, <q>in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152312"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:22</a></span> or how <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Job says, when speaking about his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <q>for man that is born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is short-lived and full of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>: as the flower of grass, so does he fall; and he departs like a shadow, nor shall he stay. Have You not taken account even of him, and caused him to enter into judgment in Your sight? For who shall be pure from uncleanness? Not even one, even if his life should be but of one day upon the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152313"><a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse1">Job&nbsp;14:1-5</a></span> Now when he speaks of <em>uncleanness</em> here, the mere perusal of the passage is enough to show that he meant <em><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em> to be understood. It is plain from the words, of what he is speaking. The same phrase and sense occur in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Zechariah, in the place where <q>the filthy garments</q> are removed from off the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and it is said to him, <q>I have taken away your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152314"><a href="../bible/zec003.htm#verse4">Zechariah&nbsp;3:4</a></span> Well now, I rather think that all these passages, and others of like import, which point to the fact that man is born in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and under the curse, are not to be read among the dark recesses of the Manicheans, but in the sunshine of catholic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 51.&mdash; To Call Those that Teach Original Sin Manicheans is to Accuse Ambrose, Cyprian, and the Whole Church.</h2>

<p>What, moreover, shall I say of those commentators on the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> who have flourished in the catholic Church? They have never tried to pervert these testimonies to an alien sense, because they were firmly established in our most ancient and solid <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and were never moved aside by the novelty of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Were I to wish to collect these together, and to make use of their testimony, the task would both be too long, and I should probably seem to have bestowed less preference than I ought on canonical authorities,  from which one must never deviate. I will merely mention the most blessed Ambrose, to whom (as I have already observed ) Pelagius accorded so signal a testimony of his integrity in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. This Ambrose, however, maintained that there was nothing else in infants, which required the healing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, than original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.  But in respect of Cyprian, with his all-<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> crown,  will any one say of him, that he either was, or ever could by any possibility have been, a Manichean, when he suffered before the pestilent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> had made its appearance in the Roman world? And yet, in his book on the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of infants, he so vigorously maintains original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as to declare, that even before the eighth day, if necessary, the infant ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, lest his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should be lost; and he wished it to be understood, that the infant could the more readily attain to the indulgence of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, inasmuch as it is not so much his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of another, which are remitted to him. Well, then, let this writer dare to call these Manicheans; let him, moreover, under this scandalous imputation asperse that most ancient tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whereby infants are, as I have said, exorcised with exsufflation, for the purpose of being translated into the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, after they are delivered from the power of darkness&mdash; that is to say, of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. As for ourselves, indeed, we are more ready to be associated with these men, and with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so firmly rooted in this ancient <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in suffering any amount of curse and contumely, than with the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, to be covered with the flattery of public praise.</p>

<h2>Chapter 52 [XXX.]&mdash; Sin Was the Origin of All Shameful Concupiscence.</h2>

<p><q>Do you,</q> he asks, <q>repeat your affirmation, 'There would be no concupiscence if man had not first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; marriage, however, would have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, even if no one had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>'?</q> I never said, <q>There would be no concupiscence,</q> because there is a concupiscence of the spirit, which craves wisdom. <span class="stiki" id="note152319"><a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse21">Wisdom&nbsp;6:21</a></span> My words were, <q>There would be no <em>shameful</em> concupiscence.</q>  Let my words be re-perused, even those which he has cited, that it may be clearly seen how dishonestly they are handled by him. However, let him call it by any name he likes. What I said would not have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> unless man had previously <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, was that which made them ashamed in paradise when they covered their loins, and which every one will allow would not have been felt, had not the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of disobedience first occurred. Now he who wishes to understand what they felt, ought to consider what it was they covered. For of the fig-leaves they made themselves <q>aprons,</q> not clothes; and these aprons or kilts are called <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03B6;&#x1F7D;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span> in Greek. Now all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well enough what it is which these <em> peri-zomata</em> cover, which some Latin writers explain by the word <em>campestria</em>. Who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> wore this kilt, and what parts of the body such a dress concealed; even the same which the Roman youths used to cover when they practised naked in the <em>campus</em>, from which circumstance the name <em> campester</em> was given to the apron. </p>

<h2>Chapter 53 [XXXI.]&mdash; Concupiscence Need Not Have Been Necessary for Fruitfulness.</h2>

<p>He says: <q>Therefore that marriage which might have been without concupiscence, without bodily motion, without necessity for sexual organs&mdash; to use your own statement&mdash; is pronounced by you to be laudable; whereas such marriages as are now enacted are, according to your decision, the invention of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Those, therefore, whose institution was possible in your dreams, you deliberately assert to be good, while those which <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> intends, when it says, 'Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh,' <span class="stiki" id="note152322"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;2:24</a></span> you pronounce to be diabolical <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, worthy, in short, to be called a pest, not matrimony.</q> It is not to be wondered at, that these Pelagian opponents of mine try to twist my words to any meaning they wish them to bear, when it has been their custom to do the same thing with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, and not simply in obscure passages, but where their testimony is clear and plain: a custom, indeed, which is followed by all other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Now who could make such an assertion, as that it was possible for marriages to be <q>without bodily motion, without necessity for sexual organs</q>? For God made the sexes; because, as it is written, <q>He created them male and female.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152323"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse27">Genesis&nbsp;1:27</a></span> But how could it possibly happen, that they who were to be united together, and by the very union were to beget children, were not to move their bodies, when, of course, there can be no bodily contact of one person with another if bodily motion be not resorted to? The question before us, then, is not about the motion of bodies, without which there could not be sexual intercourse; but about the shameful motion of the organs of generation, which certainly could be absent, and yet the fructifying connection be still not wanting, if the organs of generation were not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, but simply to the will, like the other members of the body. Is it not even now the case, in <q>the body of this death,</q> that a command is given to the foot, the arm, the finger, the lip, or the tongue, and they are instantly set in motion at this intimation of our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>? And (to take a still more wonderful case) even the liquid contained in the urinary vessels obeys the command to flow from us at our pleasure, and when we are not pressed with its overflow; while the vessels, also, which contain the liquid, discharge without difficulty, if they are in a healthy state, the office assigned them by our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of propelling, pressing out, and ejecting their contents. With how much greater ease and quietness, then, if the generative organs of our body were compliant, would natural motion ensue, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conception be effected; except in the instance of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who violate natural order, and by a righteous retribution are punished with the intractability of these members and organs! This punishment is felt by the chaste and pure, who, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, would rather beget children by mere natural desire than by voluptuous pruriency; while unchaste <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who are impelled by this diseased passion, and bestow their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> upon harlots as well as wives, are excited by a still heavier mental remorse in consequence of this carnal chastisement.</p>

<h2>Chapter 54 [XXXII.]&mdash; How Marriage is Now Different Since the Existence of Sin.</h2>

<p>God forbid that we should say, what this man pretends we say, <q>Such marriages as are now enacted are the invention of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> Why, they are absolutely the same marriages as God made at the very first. For this blessing of His, which He appointed for the procreation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, He has not taken away even from men under condemnation, any more than He has deprived them of their senses and bodily limbs, which are no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> His gifts, although they are condemned to die by an already incurred retribution. This, I say, is the marriage whereof it was said (only excepting the great sacrament of Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which the institution prefigured): <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152324"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;2:24</a></span> For this, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, was said before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and if no one had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, it might have been done without shameful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. And now, although it is not done without that, in the body of this death, there is that nevertheless which does not cease to be done so that a man may cleave to his wife, and they two be one flesh. When, therefore, it is alleged that marriage is now one thing, but might have been another had no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, this is not predicated of its nature, but of a certain quality which has undergone a change for the worse. Just as a man is said to be different, though he is actually the same individual, when he has changed his manner of life either for the better or the worse; for as a righteous man he is one thing, and as a sinful man another, though the man himself be really the same individual. In like manner, marriage without shameful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is one thing, and marriage with shameful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is another. When, however, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is lawfully united to her husband in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> constitution of wedlock, and fidelity to what is due to the flesh is kept free from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and so children are lawfully begotten, it is actually the very same marriage which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> instituted at first, although by his primeval inducement to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> inflicted a heavy wound, not, indeed, on marriage itself, but on man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> by whom marriage is made, by his prevailing on them to disobey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is requited in the course of the divine judgment by the reciprocal disobedience of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> own members. United in this matrimonial state, although they were ashamed of their nakedness, still they were not by any means able altogether to lose the blessedness of marriage which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> appointed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 55 [XXXIII.]&mdash; Lust is a Disease; The Word <q>Passion</q> In the Ecclesiastical Sense.</h2>

<p>He then passes on from those who are united in marriage to those who are born of it. It is in relation to these that we have to encounter the most laborious discussions with the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in connection with our subject. Impelled by some hidden instinct from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he makes avowals which go far to untie the whole knot. For in his desire to raise greater odium against us, because we had said that infants are born in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> even of lawful wedlock, he makes the following observation: <q>You assert that they, indeed, who have not been ever born might possibly have been good; those, however, who have peopled the world, and for whom Christ died, you decide to be the work of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, born in a disordered state, and guilty from the beginning. Therefore,</q> he continues, <q>I have shown that you are doing nothing else than denying that God is the Creator of the men who actually exist.</q> I beg to say, that I declare none but God to be the Creator of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, however <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> it be that all are born in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and must perish unless born again. It was, indeed, the sinful corruption which had been sown in them by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> persuasion that became the means of their being born in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; not the created nature of which men are composed. Shameful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, however, could not excite our members, except at our own will, if it were not a disease. Nor would even the lawful and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> cohabiting of husband and wife raise a blush, with avoidance of any eye and desire of secrecy, if there were not a diseased condition about it. Moreover, the apostle would not prohibit the possession of wives in this disease, did not disease exist in it. The phrase in the Greek text, <span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BD; &#x03C0;&#x1F71;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03B9; &#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03B8;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>, is by some rendered in Latin, <em>in morbo desiderii</em> vel <em>concupiscenti&aelig;</em>, in the disease of desire or of concupiscence; by others, however, <em>in passione concupiscenti&aelig;</em>, in the passion of concupiscence; or however it is found otherwise in different copies: at any rate, the Latin equivalent <em>passio</em> (passion), especially in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> use, is usually understood as a term of censure.</p>

<h2>Chapter 56.&mdash; The Pelagians Allow that Christ Died Even for Infants; Julianus Slays Himself with His Own Sword.</h2>

<p>But whatever opinion he may entertain about the shame-causing concupiscence of the flesh, I must request your attention to what he has said respecting infants (and it is in their behalf that we labour), as to their being supposed to need a Saviour, if they are not to die without <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. I repeat his words once more: <q>You assert,</q> says he to me, <q>that they, indeed, who have not been ever born might possibly have been good; those, however, who have peopled the world, <em>and for whom Christ died</em>, you decide to be the work of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, born in a disordered state, and guilty from the very beginning.</q> Would that he only solved the entire controversy as he unties the knot of this question! For will he pretend to say that he merely spoke of adults in this passage? Why, the subject in hand is about infants, about <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings at their birth; and it is about these that he raises odium against us, because they are defined by us as guilty from the very first, because we declare them to be guilty, since Christ died for them. And why did Christ die for them if they are not guilty? It is entirely from them, yes, from them, we shall find the reason, wherefore he thought odium should be raised against me. He asks: <q>How are infants guilty, for whom Christ died?</q> We answer: Nay, how are infants not guilty, since Christ died for them? This dispute wants a judge to determine it. Let Christ be the Judge, and let Him tell us what is the object which has profited by His death? <q>This is my blood,</q> He says, <q>which shall be shed  for many for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152326"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;26:28</a></span> Let the apostle, too, be His assessor in the judgment; since even in the apostle it is Christ Himself that speaks. Speaking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, he exclaims: <q>He who spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152327"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;8:32</a></span> I suppose that he describes Christ as so delivered up for us all, that infants in this matter are not separated from ourselves. But what need is there to dwell on this point, out of which even he no longer raises a contest? For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, he not only confesses that Christ died even for infants, but he also reproves us out of this admission, because we say that these same infants are guilty for whom Christ died. Now, then, let the apostle, who says that Christ was delivered up for us all, also tell us why Christ was delivered up for us. <q>He was delivered,</q> says he, <q>for our offenses, and rose again for our justification.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152328"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;4:25</a></span> If, therefore, as even this man both confesses and professes, both admits and objects, infants, too, are included among those for whom Christ was delivered up; and if it was for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that Christ was delivered up, even infants, of course, must have original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for whom Christ was delivered up; He must have something in them to heal, who (as Himself affirms) is not needed as a Physician by the whole, but by the sick; <span class="stiki" id="note152329"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;9:12</a></span> He must have a reason for saving them, seeing that He came into the world, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says, <q>to save sinners;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152330"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:15</a></span> He must have something in them to remit, who testifies that He shed His blood <q>for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152331"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;26:28</a></span> He must have good reason for seeking them out, who <q>came,</q> as He says, <q>to seek and to save that which was lost;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152332"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;19:10</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> must find in them something to destroy, who came for the express purpose, as the Apostle John says, <q>that He might destroy the works of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152333"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:8</a></span> Now to this <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of infants He must be an enemy, who asserts their innocence, in such a way as to deny them the medicine which is required by the hurt and wounded.</p>

<h2>Chapter 57 [XXXIV.]&mdash; The Great Sin of the First Man.</h2>

<p>Now observe what follows, as he goes on to say: <q>If, before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, God created a source from which men should be born, but the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> a source from which <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were disturbed, then beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> must be ascribed to those that are born, and guilt to those that produce. Since, however, this would be a most manifest condemnation of marriage; remove, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, this view from the midst of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and really <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that all things were made by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and that without Him nothing was made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152334"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> He so speaks here, as if he would make us say, that there is a something in man's substance which was created by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> persuaded <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; he did not create it as a nature. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he persuaded nature for man is nature; and therefore by his persuasion he corrupted it. He who wounds a limb does not, of course, create it, but he injures it.  Those wounds, indeed, which are inflicted on the body produce lameness in a limb, or difficulty of motion; but they do not affect the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whereby a man becomes righteous: that wound, however, which has the name of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, wounds the very life, which was being righteously lived. This wound was at that fatal moment of the fall inflicted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to a vastly wider and deeper extent than are the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> among men. Whence it came to pass, that our nature having then and there been deteriorated by that great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the first man, not only was made a sinner, but also generates sinners; and yet the very weakness, under which the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life has drooped and died, is not really nature, but corruption; precisely as a bad state of health is not a bodily substance or nature, but disorder; very often, indeed, if not always, the ailing character of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> is in a certain way implanted, and reappears in the bodies of their children.</p>

<h2>Chapter 58.&mdash; Adam's Sin is Derived from Him to Every One Who is Born Even of Regenerate Parents; The Example of the Olive Tree and the Wild Olive.</h2>

<p>But this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which changed man for the worse in paradise, because it is far greater than we can form any judgment of, is contracted by every one at his birth, and is remitted only in the regenerate; and this derangement is such as to be derived even from <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who have been regenerated, and in whom the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is remitted and covered, to the condemnation of the children born of them, unless these, who were bound by their first and carnal birth, are absolved by their second and spiritual birth. Of this wonderful fact the Creator has produced a wonderful example in the cases of the olive and the wild olive trees, in which, from the seed not only of the wild olive, but even of the good olive, nothing but a wild olive springs. Wherefore, although even in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whose natural birth is followed by regeneration through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, there exists this carnal concupiscence which contends against the law of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, yet, seeing that it is remitted in the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, it is no longer accounted to them as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor is it in any degree hurtful, unless consent is yielded to its motions for unlawful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Their offspring, however, being begotten not of spiritual concupiscence, but of carnal, like a wild olive of our race from the good olive, derives guilt from them by natural birth to such a degree that it cannot be liberated from that pest except by being born again. How is it, then, that this man affirms that we ascribe <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to those who are born, and guilt to their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>? When the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> rather shows that even if there has been <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is inherent in their children, which is abolished in them only if they are born again.</p>

<h2>Chapter 59 [XXXV.]&mdash; The Pelagians Can Hardly Venture to Place Concupiscence in Paradise Before the Commission of Sin.</h2>

<p>This being the case, let him think what he pleases about this concupiscence of the flesh and about the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> which lords it over the unchaste, has to be mastered by the chaste, and yet is to be blushed at both by the chaste and the unchaste; for I see plainly he is much pleased with it. Let him not hesitate to praise what he is ashamed to name; let him call it (as he has in fact called it) the vigour of the members, and let him not be afraid of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of chaste ears; let him designate it the power of the members, and let him not care about the impudence. Let him say, if his blushes permit him, that if no one had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, this vigour must have flourished like a flower in paradise; nor would there have been any need to cover that which would have been so moved that no one should have felt ashamed; rather, with a wife provided, it would have been ever exercised and never repressed, lest so great a pleasure should ever be denied to so vast a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Far be it from being thought that such blessedness could in such a spot fail to have what it wished, or ever experience in mind or body what it disliked. And so, should the motion of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> precede men's will, then the will would immediately follow it. The wife, who ought certainly never to be absent in this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> state of things, would be urged on by it, whether about to conceive or already pregnant; and, either a child would be begotten, or a natural and laudable pleasure would be gratified,&mdash; for perish all seed rather than disappoint the appetite of so good a concupiscence. Only be sure that the united pair do not apply themselves to that use of each other which is contrary to nature, then (with so modest a reservation) let them use, as often as they would have delight, their organs of generation, created for the purpose. But what if this very use, which is contrary to nature, should perhaps give them delight; what if the aforesaid laudable <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> should hanker even after such delight; I wonder whether they should pursue it because it was sweet, or loathe it because it was base? If they should pursue it to gratification, what becomes of all thought about <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>? If they should loathe it, where is the peaceful composure of so good a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>? But at this point perchance his blushes will awake, and he will say that so great is the tranquillity of this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> state, and so entire the orderliness which may have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in this state of things, that carnal concupiscence never preceded these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons'</a> will: only whenever they themselves wished, would it then arise; and only then would they entertain the wish, when there was need for begetting children; and the result would be, that no seed would ever be emitted to no purpose, nor would any embrace ever ensue which would not be followed by conception and birth; the flesh would <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the will, and concupiscence would vie with it in subserviency. Well, if he says all this of the imagined <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> state, he must at least be pretty sure that what he describes does not now exist among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And even if he will not concede that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is a corrupt condition, let him at least allow that through the disobedience of the man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> state the very concupiscence of their flesh was corrupted, so that what would once be excited obediently and orderly is now moved disobediently and inordinately, and that to such a degree that it is not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of even chaste-minded husbands and wives, so that it is excited when it is not wanted; and whenever it is necessary, it never, indeed, follows their will, but sometimes too hurriedly, at other times too tardily, exerts its own movements. Such, then, is the rebellion of this concupiscence which the primitive pair received for their own disobedience, and transfused by natural descent to us. It certainly was not at their bidding, but in utter disorder, that it was excited, when they covered their members, which at first were worthy to be gloried in, but had then become a ground of shame.</p>

<h2>Chapter 60.&mdash; Let Not the Pelagians Indulge Themselves in a Cruel Defence of Infants.</h2>

<p>As I said, however, let him entertain what views he likes of this <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; let him proclaim it as he pleases, praise it as much as he chooses (and he pleases <em>much</em>, as several of his extracts show), that the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> may gratify themselves, if not with its uses, at all events with its praises, as many of them as fail to enjoy the limitation of continence enjoined in wedlock. Only let him spare the infants, so as not to praise their condition uselessly, and defend them cruelly. Let him not declare them to be safe; let him suffer them to come, not, indeed, to Pelagius for eulogy, but to Christ for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For, that this book may be now brought to a termination, since the dissertation of this man is ended, which was written on the short paper you sent me, I will close with his last words: <q>Really <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that all things were made by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and that without Him nothing was made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152336"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> Let him grant that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is Jesus even to infants; and as he confesses that all things were made by Him, in that He is <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, so let him acknowledge that infants, too, are saved by Him in that He is Jesus; let him, I say, do this if he would be a catholic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. For thus it is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>And they shall call His name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note152337"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;1:21</a></span> &mdash; Jesus, because Jesus is in Latin <em>Salvator</em>, <q>Saviour.</q> He shall, indeed, save His people; and among His people surely there are infants. <q>From their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></q> shall He save them; in infants, too, therefore, are there original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, on account of which He can be Jesus, that is, Saviour, even unto them.</p>
