<h1>On Marriage and Concupiscence (Companion Letter)</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">A letter  addressed to the Count Valerius, on Augustine's forwarding to him what he calls his first book <q>On Marriage and Concupiscence.</q> </span> </p>

<p>To the illustrious and deservedly eminent Lord and his most dearly beloved son in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Valerius, Augustine sends greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>1. While I was chafing at the long disappointment of receiving no acknowledgments from your Highness of the many letters which I had written to you, I all at once received three letters from your Grace,&mdash; one by the hand of my fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Vindemialis, which was not meant for me only, and two, soon afterwards, through my brother <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Firmus. This <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, who is bound to me, as you may have ascertained from his own lips, by the ties of a most intimate <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, had much conversation with me about your excellence, and gave me undoubted <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of his complete <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of your character <q>in the bowels of Christ;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152056"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;1:8</a></span> by these means he had sight, not only of the letters of which the fore-mentioned <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and he himself had been the bearers, but also of those which we expressed our disappointment at not having received. Now his information respecting you was all the more pleasant to us, inasmuch as he gave me to understand, what it was out of your power to do, that you would not, even at my earnest request for an answer, become the extoller of your own praises, contrary to the permission of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note152057"><a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse2">Proverbs&nbsp;27:2</a></span> But I ought myself to hesitate to write to you in this strain, lest I should incur the suspicion of flattering you, my illustrious and deservedly eminent lord and dearly beloved son in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>2. Now, as to your praises in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or rather Christ's praises in you, see what delight and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> it was to me to hear of them from him, who could neither deceive me because of his fidelity to me, nor be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of them by reason of his friendship with you. But other testimony, which though inferior in amount and certainty has still reached my ear from various quarters, assures me how sound and catholic is your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; how devout your hope of the future; how great your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the brethren; how <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> your mind amid the highest honours, as you do not trust in uncertain riches, but in the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and art rich in good works; <span class="stiki" id="note152058"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:17</a></span> how your house is a rest and comfort of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and a terror to evil-doers; how great is your care that no man lay snares for Christ's members (either among His old enemies or those of more recent days), although he use Christ's name as a cloak for his wiles; and at the same time, though you give no quarter to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of these enemies, how provident you are to secure their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. This and the like, we frequently hear, as I have already said, even from others; but at the present moment we have, by means of the above-mentioned brother, received a fuller and more trustworthy <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>3. Touching, however, the subject of conjugal purity, that we might be able to bestow our commendation and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> upon you for it, could we possibly listen to the information of any one but some bosom friend of your own, who had no mere superficial acquaintance with you, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> your innermost life? Concerning, therefore, this excellent gift of God to you, I am delighted to converse with you with more frankness and at greater length. I am quite sure that I shall not prove burdensome to you, even if I send you a prolix treatise, the perusal of which will only ensure a longer converse between us. For this have I discovered, that amidst your manifold and weighty cares you pursue your reading with ease and pleasure; and that you take great delight in any little performances of ours, even if they are addressed to other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, whenever they have chanced to fall into your hands. Whatever, therefore, is addressed to <em>yourself</em>, in which I can speak to you as it were personally, you will deign both to notice with greater attention, and to receive with a higher pleasure. From the perusal, then, of this letter, turn to the book which I send with it. It will in its very commencement, in a more convenient manner, intimate to your Reverence the reason, both why it has been written, and why it has been submitted specially to your consideration.</p>
