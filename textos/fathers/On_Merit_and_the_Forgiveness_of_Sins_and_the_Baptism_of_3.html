<h1>On Merit and the Forgiveness of Sins, and the Baptism of Infants (Book III)</h1>

<p> <em>In the Shape of a Letter Addressed to the Same Marcellinus.</em></p>

<p> <em>In which Augustine refutes some <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Pelagius on the question of the merits of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of infants&mdash; being sundry arguments of his which he had interspersed among his expositions of Saint <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in opposition to original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</em></p>

<p>To his beloved son Marcellinus, Augustine, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and servant of Christ and of the servants of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, sends greeting in the Lord.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1 [I.]&mdash; Pelagius Esteemed a Holy Man; His Expositions on Saint Paul.</h2>

<p>The questions which you proposed that I should write to you about, in opposition to those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who say that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> would have died even if he had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and that nothing of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has passed to his posterity by natural transmission; and especially on the subject of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of infants, which the universal Church, with most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and maternal care, maintains in constant celebration; and whether in this life there are, or have been, or ever will be, children of men without any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all&mdash; I have already discussed in two lengthy books. And I venture to think that if in them I have not met all the points which perplex all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> minds on such matters (an achievement which, I apprehend&mdash;nay, which I have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>&mdash;lies beyond the power either of myself, or of any other person), I have at all events prepared something in the shape of a firm ground on which those who defend the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> delivered to us by our fathers, against the novel opinions of its opponents, may at any time take their stand, not unarmed for the contest. However, within the last few days I have read some writings by Pelagius,&mdash; a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, as I am told, who has made no small progress in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life&mdash;containing some very brief expository notes on the epistles of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>;  and therein I found, on coming to the passage where the apostle says, <q>By one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so it passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150653"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> an argument which is used by those who say that infants are not burdened with original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now I confess that I have not refuted this argument in my lengthy treatise, because it did not indeed once occur to me that anybody was capable of thinking such sentiments. Being, however, unwilling to add to that work, which I had concluded, I have thought it right to insert in this epistle both the argument itself in the very words in which I read it, and the answer which it seems to me proper to give to it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2 [II.]&mdash; Pelagius' Objection; Infants Reckoned Among the Number of Believers and the Faithful.</h2>

<p>In these terms, then, the argument is stated:&mdash; <q>But they who deny the transmission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> endeavour to impugn it thus: If (say they) Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> injured even those who do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, therefore Christ's righteousness also profits even those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; because 'In like manner, nay, much more,' he says, 'are men saved by one, than they had previously perished by one.'</q> Now to this argument, I repeat, I advanced no reply in the two books which I previously addressed to you; nor, indeed, had I proposed to myself such a task. But now I beg you first of all to observe, when they say, <q>If Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> injures even those who do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, then Christ's righteousness also profits even those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</q> how absurd and false they judge it to be, that the righteousness of Christ should profit even those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; and that thence they think to put together such an argument as this: That no more could the first man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> possibly do injury to infants who commit no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, than the righteousness of Christ can benefit any who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Let them therefore tell us what is the benefit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> righteousness to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> infants; let them by all means tell us what they mean. For of course, since they do not forget that they are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> themselves, they have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that there is some benefit. But whatever be this benefit, it is incapable (as they themselves assert) of benefiting those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Whence they are compelled to class <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> infants in the number of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and to assent to the authority of the Holy Universal Church, which does not account those unworthy of the name of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, to whom the righteousness of Christ could be, according to them, of no use except as <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. As, therefore, by the answer of those, through whose agency they are born again, the Spirit of righteousness transfers to them that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which, of their own will, they could not yet have; so the sinful flesh of those, through whose agency they are born, transfers to them that injury, which they have not yet contracted in their own life. And even as the Spirit of life regenerates them in Christ as <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, so also the body of death had generated them in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> as sinners. The one generation is carnal, the other Spiritual; the one makes children of the flesh, the other children of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; the one children of death, the other children of the resurrection; the one the children of the world, the other the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the one children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, the other children of mercy; and thus the one binds them under original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the other liberates them from the bond of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; Pelagius Makes God Unjust.</h2>

<p>We are driven at last to yield our assent on divine authority to that which we are unable to investigate with even the clearest <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. It is well that they remind us themselves that Christ's righteousness is unable to profit any but <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, while they yet allow that it somewhat profits infants; according to this (as we have already said) they must, without evasion, find room for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> infants among the number of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. Consequently, if they are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, they will have to rank among those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; and therefore they will not even have life, but <q>the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God abides on them,</q> inasmuch as <q>he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not the Son shall not see life; but the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God abides on him;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150654"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;3:36</a></span> and they are under judgment, since <q>he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not is condemned already;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150655"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;3:18</a></span> and they shall be condemned, since <q>he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>, and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, shall be saved; but he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not shall be damned.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150656"><a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse16">Mark&nbsp;16:16</a></span> Let them, now, then see to it with what <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> they can hold or strive to maintain that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings have no part in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, but in the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and incur the divine judgment and condemnation, who are without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; if, that is, as they cannot have any actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so also they have within them no original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p>To the other points which Pelagius makes them urge who argue against original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, I have already, I think, sufficiently and clearly replied in the two former books of my lengthy treatise. Now if my reply should seem to any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to be brief or obscure, I beg their pardon, and request the favour of their coming to terms with those who perhaps censure my treatise, not for being too brief, but rather as being too long; while any who still do not understand the points which I cannot help thinking I have explained as clearly as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the subject allowed me, shall certainly hear no blame or reproach from me for indifference, or want of understanding me.  I would rather that they should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> God to give them intelligence.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5 [III.]&mdash; Pelagius Praised by Some; Arguments Against Original Sin Proposed by Pelagius in His Commentary.</h2>

<p>But we must not indeed omit to observe that this good and praiseworthy man (as they who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him describe him to be) has not advanced this argument against the natural transmission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in his own person, but has reproduced what is alleged by those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who disapprove of the doctrine, and this, not merely so far as I have just quoted and confuted the allegation, but also as to those other points on which I have now further undertaken to furnish a reply. Now, after saying, <q>If (they say) Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> injured even those who do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, therefore Christ's righteousness also profits even those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</q>&mdash; which sentence, you will perceive from what I have said in answer to it, is not only not repugnant to what we hold, but even reminds us what we ought to hold&mdash;he at once goes on to add, <q>Then they contend, if <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> cleanses away that old <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, those children who are born of two <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> must needs be free from this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for they could not have transmitted to their children what they did not possess themselves. Besides,</q> says he, <q>if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not of transmission, but only the flesh, then only the latter has the transmission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and it alone deserves punishment; for they allege that it would be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is only now born, and comes not of the lump of Adam, to bear the burden of so old an alien <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. They say, likewise,</q> says Pelagius, <q>that it cannot by any means be conceded that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who remits to a man his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, should impute to him another's.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; Why Pelagius Does Not Speak in His Own Person.</h2>

<p>Pray, don't you see how Pelagius has inserted the whole of this paragraph in his writings, not in his own person, but in that of others, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> so well the novelty of this unheard-of doctrine, which is now beginning to raise its voice against the ancient ingrafted opinion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that he was ashamed or afraid to acknowledge it himself? And perhaps he does not himself think that a man is born without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for whom he confesses that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to be necessary by which comes the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; or that the man is condemned without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> who must be reckoned, when unbaptized, in the class of non-<a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, since the gospel of course cannot deceive us, when it most clearly asserts, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not shall be damned;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150658"><a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse16">Mark&nbsp;16:16</a></span> or, lastly, that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is not admitted into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, forasmuch as <q>except a man be born of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150659"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;3:5</a></span> &mdash; and so must either be precipitated into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or, what is still more absurd, must have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life outside the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>; for the Lord, when foretelling what He should say to His people at last&mdash;<q>Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150660"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;25:34</a></span> &mdash; also clearly indicated what the kingdom was of which He was speaking, by concluding thus: <q>So these shall go away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous into life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150661"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;25:46</a></span> These opinions, then, and others which spring from the central <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> so worthy a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and so good a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, does not at all accept, as being too perverse and repugnant to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But it is quite possible that he may, by the very arguments of those who deny the transmission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, be still so far distressed as to be anxious to hear or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what can be said in reply to them; and on this account he was both unwilling to keep silent the tenets propounded by them who deny the transmission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in order that he might get the question in due time discussed, and, at the same time, declined to report the opinions in his own person, lest he should be supposed to entertain them himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7 [IV.]&mdash; Proof of Original Sin in Infants.</h2>

<p>Now, although I may not be able myself to refute the arguments of these men, I yet see how necessary it is to adhere closely to the clearest statements of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, in order that the obscure passages may be explained by help of these, or, if the mind be as yet unequal to either perceiving them when explained, or investigating them while abstruse, let them be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> without misgiving. But what can be plainer than the many weighty testimonies of the divine declarations, which afford to us the clearest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> possible that without union with Christ there is no man who can attain to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and that no man can <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> be damned,&mdash; that is, separated from that life and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>&mdash;by the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a>? The inevitable conclusion from these truths is this, that, as nothing else is effected when infants are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> except that they are incorporated into the church, in other words, that they are united with the body and members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, unless this benefit has been bestowed upon them, they are manifestly in danger of  damnation. Damned, however, they could not be if they really had no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now, since their tender age could not possibly have contracted <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in its own life, it remains for us, even if we are as yet unable to understand, at least to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that infants inherit original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; Jesus is the Saviour Even of Infants.</h2>

<p>And therefore, if there is an ambiguity in the apostle's words when he says, <q>By one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so it passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150663"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> and if it is possible for them to be drawn aside, and applied to some other sense&mdash;is there anything ambiguous in this statement: <q>Unless a man be born again of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150664"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;3:5</a></span> Is this, again, ambiguous: <q>You shall call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150665"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;1:21</a></span> Is there any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of what this means: <q>The whole need not a physician, but they that are sick?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150666"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;9:12</a></span> &mdash; that is, Jesus is not needed by those who have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but by those who are to be saved from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Is there anything, again, ambiguous in this: <q>Except men eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>,</q> that is, become partakers of His body, <q>they shall not have life?</q>  By these and similar statements, which I now pass over, &mdash; absolutely clear in the light of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and absolutely certain by His authority&mdash;does not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> proclaim without ambiguity, that unbaptized infants not only cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, but cannot have everlasting life, except in the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in order that they may be incorporated into which they are washed in the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>? Does not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, without any dubiety, testify that for no other reason are they carried by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> hands to Jesus (that is, to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Saviour and Physician), than that they may be healed of the plague of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the medicine of His <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>? Why then do we delay so to understand the apostle's very words, of which we perhaps used to have some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that they may agree with these statements of which we can have no manner of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; The Ambiguity of <q>Adam is the Figure of Him to Come.</q></h2>

<p>To me, however, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> presents itself about the whole of this passage, in which the apostle speaks of the condemnation of many through the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one, and the justification of many through the righteousness of One, except as to the words, <q>Adam is the figure of Him that was to come.</q>  For this phrase in reality not only suits the sense which understands that Adam's posterity were to be born of the same form as himself along with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but the words are also capable of being drawn out into several distinct meanings. For we have ourselves perhaps actually contended for various senses from the words in question at different times,  and very likely we shall propound yet another view, which, however, will not be incompatible with the sense here mentioned; and even Pelagius has not always expounded the passage in one way. All the rest, however, of the passage in which these doubtful words occur, if its statements are carefully examined and treated, as I have tried my best to do in the first book of this treatise, will not (in spite of the obscurity of style necessarily engendered by the subject itself) fail to show the incompatibility of any other meaning than that which has secured the adhesion of the universal Church from the earliest times&mdash; that believing infants have obtained through the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ the remission of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10 [V.]&mdash; He Shows that Cyprian Had Not Doubted the Original Sin of Infants.</h2>

<p>Accordingly, it is not without reason that the blessed Cyprian  carefully shows how from the very first the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has held this as a well understood article of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. When he was asserting the fitness of infants only just born to receive Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, on a certain occasion when he was consulted whether this ought to be administered before the eighth day, he endeavoured, as far as he could, to prove that they were perfect,  lest any one should suppose, from the number of the days (because it was on the eighth day that infants were before <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>), that they so far lacked perfection. However, after bestowing upon them the full support of his argument, he still confessed that they were not free from original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; because if he had denied this, he would have removed all reason for the very <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which he was maintaining their fitness to receive. You can, if you wish, read for yourself the epistle of the illustrious <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <em>On the Baptism of Little Children</em>; for it cannot fail to be within reach at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>. But I have deemed it right to transcribe some few statements of it into this letter of mine, so far as applies to the question before us; and I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you to mark them carefully. <q>Now with respect,</q> says he, <q>to the case of infants, whom you declared it would be improper to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> if presented within the second and third day after their birth, since that due regard ought to be paid to the law of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of old, so that you thought that the infant should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and sanctified before the eighth day after its birth&mdash;a far different view has been formed of the question in our council. Not a man there assented to what you thought ought to be done; but the whole of us rather determined that to no one born of men ought God's mercy and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to be denied. For since the Lord in His gospel says, 'The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them,' <span class="stiki" id="note150672"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse56">Luke&nbsp;9:56</a></span> so far as in us lies, not a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> ought, if possible, to be lost.</q> You observe how in these words he supposes that it is fraught with ruin and death, not only to the flesh, but also to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for one to depart this life without that saving sacrament. Wherefore, if he said nothing else, it was competent to us to conclude from his words that without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could not perish. See, however, what (when he shortly afterwards maintains the innocence of infants) he at the same time allows concerning them in the plainest terms: <q>But if,</q> says he, <q>anything could hinder men from the attainment of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, then their heavier <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> might rather hinder those who have reached the stages of adults, and advanced life, and old age. Since, however, remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is given even to the greatest sinners after they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, however much they have previously <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and since nobody is forbidden <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, how much more ought an infant not to be forbidden who newborn has done no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except that from having been born carnally after <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> he has contracted from his very birth the contagion of the primeval death! How, too, does this fact contribute in itself the more easily to their reception of the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that the remission which they have is not of their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but of those of another!</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; The Ancients Assumed Original Sin.</h2>

<p>You see with what confidence this great man expresses himself after the ancient and undoubted rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In advancing such very certain statements, his object was by help of these firm conclusions to prove the uncertain point which had been submitted to him by his correspondent, and concerning which he informs him that a decree of a council had been passed, to the effect that, if an infant were brought even before the eighth day after his birth, no one should hesitate to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> him. Now it was not then determined or confirmed by the council that infants were held bound by original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as if it were new, or as if it were attacked by the opposition of some one; but when another controversy was being conducted, and the question was discussed, in reference to the law of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the flesh, whether they ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> before the eighth day. None agreed with the person who denied this; because it was not an open question admitting of discussion, but was fixed and unassailable, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would forfeit <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> if it ended this life without obtaining the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: but at the same time infants fresh from the womb were held to be affected only by the guilt of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. On this account, although remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> was easier in their case, because the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were derived from another, it was nevertheless indispensable. It was on sure grounds like these that the uncertain question of the eighth day was solved, and the council decided that after a man was born, not a day ought to be lost in rendering him that succour which should prevent his perishing for ever. When also a reason was given for the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the flesh as being itself a shadow of what was to be, its purport was not that we should understand that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> ought to be administered on the eighth day after birth, but rather that we are spiritually <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> in the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who rose from the dead on the third day, indeed, after His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, but among the days of the week, by which time is counted, on the eighth, that is, on the first day after the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12 [VI.]&mdash; The Universal Consensus Respecting Original Sin.</h2>

<p>And now, again, with a strange boldness in new controversy, certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are endeavouring to make us uncertain on a point which our forefathers used to bring forward as most certainly fixed, whenever they would solve such questions as seemed uncertain to some. When this controversy, indeed, first began, I am unable to say; but one thing I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that even the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Jerome, who is in our own day renowned for great industry and learning in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> literature, for the solution of sundry questions treated in his writings, makes use of the same most certain assumption without exhibition of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>. For instance, in his commentary on the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jonah, when he comes to the passage where the infants were mentioned as chastened by the fast, he says:  <q>The greatest age comes first, and then all the rest is pervaded down to the least. <span class="stiki" id="note150674"><a href="../bible/jon003.htm#verse3">Jonah&nbsp;3:3</a></span> For there is no man without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whether the span of his age be but that of a single day, or he reckon many years to his life. For if the very stars are unclean in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note150675"><a href="../bible/job025.htm#verse4">Job&nbsp;25:4</a></span> how much more is a worm and corruption, such as are they who are held subject to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the offending Adam?</q> If, indeed, we could readily interrogate this most learned man, how many authors who have treated of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>. in both languages,  and have written on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> controversies, would he mention to us, who have never held any other opinion since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was founded&mdash;who neither received any other from their forefathers, nor handed down any other to their posterity? My own reading, indeed, has been far more limited, but yet I do not recollect ever having heard of any other doctrine on this point from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who accept the two Testaments, whether established in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or in any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> or schismatic body whatever. I do not remember, I say, that I have at any time found any other doctrine in such writers as have contributed anything to literature of this kind, whether they have followed the canonical Scriptures, or have supposed that they have followed them, or had wished to be so supposed. From what quarter this question has suddenly come upon us I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. A short time ago,  in a passing conversation with certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> while we were at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, my ears were suddenly offended with such a proposition as this: <q>That infants are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for the purpose of receiving remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but that they may be sanctified in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> Although I was much disturbed by so novel an opinion, still, as there was no opportunity afforded me for gainsaying it, and as its propounders were not <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whose influence gave me anxiety, I readily let the subject slip into neglect and oblivion. And lo! It is now maintained with burning <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; lo! It is committed to our permanent notice by writing; nay, the matter is brought to such a pitch of distracting influence, that we are even consulted on it by our brethren; and we are actually <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to oppose its progress both by disputation and by writing.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13 [VII.]&mdash; The Error of Jovinianus Did Not Extend So Far.</h2>

<p>A few years ago there lived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> one Jovinian,  who is said to have persuaded <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of even advanced age to marry,&mdash; not, indeed, by seduction, as if he wanted to make any of them his wife, but by contending that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who dedicated themselves to the <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> life had no more merit before God than believing wives. It never entered his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, however, along with this conceit, to venture to affirm that children of men are born without original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If, indeed, he had added such an opinion, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> might have more readily consented to marry, to give birth to such pure offspring. When this man's writings (for he dared to write) were by the brethren forwarded to Jerome to refute, he not only discovered no such <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in them, but, while looking out his conceits for refutation, he found among other passages this very clear testimony to the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, from which Jerome indeed felt satisfied of the man's belief of that doctrine.  These are his words when treating of it: <q>He who says that he abides in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, ought himself also to walk even as He walked. <span class="stiki" id="note150680"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;2:6</a></span> We give our opponent the option to choose which alternative he likes. Does he abide in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or does he not? If he does, then, let him walk like Christ. If, however, it is a rash thing to undertake to resemble the excellences of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he abides not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because he walks not as Christ did. He did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither was any guile found in His mouth; <span class="stiki" id="note150681"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;53:9</a></span> who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; and as a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so He opened not His mouth; <span class="stiki" id="note150682"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;53:7</a></span> to whom the prince of this world came, and found nothing in Him; <span class="stiki" id="note150683"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;14:30</a></span> whom, though He had done no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, God made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for us. <span class="stiki" id="note150684"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse21">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:21</a></span> We, however, according to the Epistle of James, all commit many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note150685"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse2">James&nbsp;3:2</a></span> and none of us is pure from uncleanness, even if his life should be but of one day. <span class="stiki" id="note150686"><a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse5">Job&nbsp;14:5</a></span> For who shall boast that he has a clean heart? Or who shall be confident that he is pure from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? We are held guilty according to the likeness of Adam's transgression. Accordingly David also says: 'Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> did my mother conceive me.'</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; The Opinions of All Controversialists Whatever are Not, However, Canonical Authority; Original Sin, How Another's; We Were All One Man in Adam.</h2>

<p>I have not quoted these words as if we might rely upon the opinions of every disputant as on canonical authority; but I have done it, that it may be seen how, from the beginning down to the present age, which has given birth to this novel opinion, the doctrine of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been guarded with the utmost constancy as a part of the Church's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that it is usually adduced as most certain ground whereon to refute other opinions when false, instead of being itself exposed to refutation by any one as false. Moreover, in the sacred books of the canon, the authority of this doctrine is vigorously asserted in the clearest and fullest way. The apostle exclaims: By one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so it passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in which all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note150688"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> Now from these words it cannot certainly be said, that Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has injured even those <em>who commit no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em>, for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q> <em>In which all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</em></q> Nor, indeed, are those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of infancy so said to be <em>another's</em>, as if they did not belong to the infants at all, inasmuch as all then <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in Adam, when in his nature, by virtue of that innate power whereby he was able to produce them, they were all as yet the one Adam; but they are called <em> another's</em>,  because as yet they were not living their own lives, but the life of the one man contained whatsoever was in his future posterity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15 [VIII.]&mdash; We All Sinned Adam's Sin.</h2>

<p><q>It is,</q> they say, <q>by no means conceded that God who remits to a man his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> imputes to him another's.</q> He remits, indeed, but it is to those regenerated by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, not to those generated by the flesh; but He imputes to a man no longer the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of another, but only his own. They were no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of another, while as yet they were not in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> who bore them when propagated; but now the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> belong to them by carnal generation, to whom they have not yet been remitted by spiritual regeneration.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; Origin of Errors; A Simile Sought from the Foreskin of the Circumcised, and from the Chaff of Wheat.</h2>

<p><q>But surely,</q> say they, <q>if <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> cleanses the primeval <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, they who are born of two baptized  <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> ought to be free from this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for these could not have transmitted to their children that thing which they did not themselves possess.</q> Now observe whence <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> usually thrives: it is when <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are able to start subjects which they are not able to understand. For before what audience, and in what words, can I explain how it is that sinful mortal beginnings bring no obstacle to those who have inaugurated other, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, beginnings, and at the same time prove an obstacle to those whom those very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, against whom it was not an obstacle, have begotten out of the self-same sinful beginnings? How can a man understand these things, whose labouring mind is impeded both by its own prejudiced opinions and by the chain of its own stolid obstinacy? If indeed I had undertaken my <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in opposition to those who either altogether forbid the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of infants, or else contend that it is superfluous to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them alleging that as they are born of believing <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, they must needs enjoy the merit of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; then it would have been my duty to have roused myself perhaps to greater labour and effort for the purpose of refuting their opinion. In that case, if I encountered a difficulty before obtuse and contentious men in refuting <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and inculcating <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, owing to the obscurity which besets the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the subject, I should probably resort to such illustrations as were palpable and at hand; and I should in my turn ask them some questions&mdash;how, for instance, if they were puzzled to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what way <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, after being cleansed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, still remained in those who were begotten of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, they would explain how it is that the foreskin, after being removed by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, should still remain in the sons of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>? Or again, how it happens that the chaff which is winnowed off so carefully by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> labour still keeps its place in the grain which springs from the winnowed wheat?</p>

<h2>Chapter 17 [IX.]&mdash; Christians Do Not Always Beget Christian, Nor the Pure, Pure Children.</h2>

<p>With these and such like palpable arguments, should I endeavour, as I best could, to convince those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of cleansing were superfluously applied to the children of the cleansed, how right is the judgment of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> the infants of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and how it may happen that to a man who has within him the twofold seed&mdash; of death in the flesh, and of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> in the spirit&mdash; that may prove no obstacle, regenerated as he is by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which is an obstacle to his son, who is generated by the flesh; and that that may be cleansed in the one by remission, which in the other still requires cleansing by like remission, just as in the case supposed of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and as in the case of the winnowing and thrashing. But now, when we are contending with those who allow that the children of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, we may much more conveniently conduct our discussion, and can say: You who assert that the children of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as have been cleansed from the pollution of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> ought to have been born without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, why do you not perceive that by the same rule you might just as well say that the children of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> ought to have been born <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? Why, therefore, do you rather maintain that they ought to become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? Was there not in their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, to whom it is said, <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your bodies are the members of Christ?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150690"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:15</a></span> a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> body? Perhaps you suppose that a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> body may be born of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, without having received a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Well, this would render the case much more wonderful still. For you would think of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> one of two things as you pleased&mdash;because, of course, you hold with the apostle, that before birth it had done nothing good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note150691"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;9:11</a></span> &mdash; either that it was derived by transmission, and just as the body of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> is <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, so should also their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; or else that it was created by Christ, either in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> body, or for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> body, and it ought therefore to have been created or given in a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> condition. Unless perchance you shall pretend that, although <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> had it in their power to beget a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> body, yet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself was not able to produce a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Believe then the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and see that, as it has been possible (as you yourselves admit) for one who is not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to be born of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, for one who is not a member of Christ to be born of members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and (that we may answer all, who, however <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, are yet in some sense possessed with a sense of religion) for a man who is not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to be born of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>; so also it is quite possible for one who is not cleansed to be born of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who are cleansed. Now what account will you give us, of why from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> is born one who is not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, unless it be that not generation, but regeneration makes <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? Resolve therefore your own question with a like reason, that cleansing from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> comes to no one by being born, but to all by being born again. And thus any child who is born of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who are cleansed, because born again, must himself be born again, in order that he too may be cleansed. For it has been quite possible for <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to transmit to their children that which they did not possess themselves&mdash;thus resembling not only the wheat which yielded the chaff, and the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> the foreskin, but also the instance which you yourselves adduce, even that of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> who convey unbelief to their posterity; which, however, does not accrue to the faithful as regenerated by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but it is owing to the fault of the mortal seed by which they have been born of the flesh. For in respect of the infants whom you judge it necessary to make <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> by the sacrament of the faithful you do not deny that they were born in unbelief although of believing <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18 [X.]&mdash; Is the Soul Derived by Natural Propagation?</h2>

<p>Well, but <q>if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not propagated, but the flesh alone, then the latter alone has propagation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and it alone deserves punishment:</q> this is what they think, saying <q>that it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is only recently produced, and that not out of Adam's substance, should bear the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of another committed so long ago.</q> Now observe, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, how the circumspect Pelagius felt the question about the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be a very difficult one, and acted accordingly&mdash;for the words which I have just quoted are copied from his book. He does not say absolutely, <q>Because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not propagated,</q> but hypothetically, <em>If the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not propagated</em>, rightly determining on so obscure a subject (on which we can find in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> no certain and obvious testimonies, or with very great difficulty discover any) to speak with hesitation rather than with confidence. Wherefore I too, on my side, answer this proposition with no hasty assertion: If the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not propagated, where is the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that, what has been but recently created and is quite free from the contagion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, should be compelled in infants to endure the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and other torments of the flesh, and, what is more terrible still, even the attacks of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>? For never does the flesh so suffer anything of this kind that the living and feeling <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not rather undergo the punishment. If this, indeed, is shown to be just, it may be shown, on the same terms, with what <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> comes to exist in our sinful flesh, to be subsequently cleansed by the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and God's gracious mercy. If the former point cannot be shown, I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the latter point is equally incapable of demonstration. We must therefore either bear with both positions in silence, and remember that we are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, or else we must prepare, at some other time, another work on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, if it shall appear necessary, discussing the whole question with caution and sobriety.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19 [XI.]&mdash; Sin and Death in Adam, Righteousness and Life in Christ.</h2>

<p>What the apostle says: <q>By one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so it passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in which all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150692"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> we must, however, for the present so accept as not to seem rashly and foolishly to oppose the many great passages of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, which teach us that no man can obtain <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life without that union with Christ which is effected in Him and with Him, when we are imbued with His <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and incorporated with the members of His body. Now this statement which the apostle addresses to the Romans, <q>By one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so it passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in which all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>,</q> tallies in sense with his words to the Corinthians: <q>Since by man came death, by Man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150693"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:21-22</a></span> For nobody doubts that the subject here referred to is the death of the body, because the apostle was with much earnestness dwelling on the resurrection of the body; and he seems to be silent here about <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for this reason, namely, because the question was not about righteousness. Both points are mentioned in the Epistle to the Romans, and both points are, at very great length, insisted on by the apostle,&mdash; <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in Adam, righteousness in Christ; and death in Adam, life in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. However, as I have observed already, I have thoroughly examined and opened, in the first book of this treatise, all these words of the apostle's argument, as far as I was able, and as much as seemed necessary.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; The Sting of Death, What?</h2>

<p>But even in the passage to the Corinthians, where he had been treating fully of the resurrection, the apostle concludes his statement in such a way as not to permit us to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the death of the body is the result of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For after he had said, <q>This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>: so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, then,</q> he added, <q>shall be brought to pass the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?</q> and at last he subjoined these words: <q>The sting of death is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and the strength of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150694"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse53">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:53-56</a></span> Now, because (as the apostle's words most plainly declare) death shall then be swallowed up in victory when this corruptible and mortal shall have put on incorruption and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>&mdash;that is, when <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall quicken even our mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwells in us,</q>&mdash; it manifestly follows that the sting of the body of this death, which is the contrary of the resurrection  of the body, is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The sting, however, is that by which death was made, and not that which death made, since it is by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that we die, and not by death that we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. It is therefore called <q>the sting of death</q> on the principle which originated the phrase <q>the tree of life,</q>&mdash; not because the life of man produced it, but because by it the life of man was made. In like manner <q>the tree of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a></q> was that whereby man's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was made, not that which man made by his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. So also <q>the sting of death</q> is that by which death was produced, not that which death made. We similarly use the expression <q>the cup of death,</q> since by it some one has died, or might die&mdash;not meaning, of course, a cup made by a dying or dead man.  The sting of death is therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because by the puncture of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> has been slain. Why ask further: the death of what&mdash;whether of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or of the body? Whether the first which we are all of us now dying, or the second which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> hereafter shall die? There is no occasion for plying the question so curiously; there is no room for subterfuge. The words in which the apostle expresses the case answer the questions: <q>When this mortal,</q> says he, <q>shall have put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, then shall be brought to pass the saying which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting? The sting of death is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the strength of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the law.</q> He was treating of the resurrection of the body, wherein death shall be swallowed up in victory, when this mortal shall have put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. Then over death itself shall be raised the shout of triumph, when at the resurrection of the body it shall be swallowed up in victory; then shall be said to it, <q>O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?</q> To the death of the body, therefore, is this said. For victorious <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> shall swallow it up, when this mortal shall put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. I repeat it, to the death of the body shall it be said, <q>Where is your victory?</q>&mdash; that victory in which you conquered all, so that even the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> engaged in conflict with you, and by not shrinking but grappling with you overcame. In these that die you have conquered; but you are yourself conquered in these that rise again. Your victory was but temporal, in which you swallowed up the bodies of them that die. Our victory will abide <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, in which you are swallowed up in the bodies of them that rise again. <q>Where is your sting?</q>&mdash; that is, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> wherewithal we are punctured and poisoned, so that you fixed yourself in our very bodies, and for so long a time held them in possession. <q>The sting of death is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the strength of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the law.</q> We all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in one, so that we all die in one; we received the law, not by amendment according to its precepts to put an end to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but by transgression to increase it. For <q>the law entered that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might abound;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150696"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;5:20</a></span> and <q>the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has concluded all under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150697"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse22">Galatians&nbsp;3:22</a></span> but <q>thanks be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has given us the victory through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150698"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse57">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:57</a></span> in order that <q>where <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> abounded, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> might much more abound;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150699"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;5:20</a></span> and <q>that the promise by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> might be given to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150700"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse22">Galatians&nbsp;3:22</a></span> and that we might overcome death by a deathless resurrection, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <q>the sting</q> thereof, by a free justification.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21 [XII.]&mdash; The Precept About Touching the Menstruous Woman Not to Be Figuratively Understood; The Necessity of the Sacraments.</h2>

<p>Let no one, then, on this subject be either deceived or a deceiver. The manifest sense of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> which we have considered, removes all obscurities. Even as death is in this our mortal body derived from the beginning, so from the beginning has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> been drawn into this sinful flesh of ours, for the cure of which, both as it is derived by propagation and augmented by wilful transgression, as well as for the quickening of our flesh itself, our Physician came in the likeness of sinful flesh, who is not needed by the sound, but only by the sick&mdash;and who came not to call the righteous, but sinners. <span class="stiki" id="note150701"><a href="../bible/mar002.htm#verse17">Mark&nbsp;2:17</a></span> Therefore the saying of the apostle, when advising <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> not to separate themselves from unbelieving partners: <q>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150702"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:14</a></span> must be either so understood as both we ourselves elsewhere,  and as Pelagius in his notes on this same Epistle to the Corinthians,  has expounded it, according to the purport of the passages already mentioned, that sometimes wives gained husbands to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and sometimes husbands converted wives, while the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> will of even one of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> prevailed towards making their children <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; or else (as the apostle's words seem rather to indicate, and to a certain degree compel us) some particular sanctification is to be here understood, by which an unbelieving husband or wife was sanctified by the believing partner, and by which the children of the believing <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were sanctified,&mdash; whether it was that the husband or the wife, during the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> menstruation, abstained from cohabiting, having learned that duty in the law (for Ezekiel classes this among the precepts which were not to be taken in a metaphorical sense <span class="stiki" id="note150705"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse6">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:6</a></span>), or on account of some other <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> sanctification which is not there expressly prescribed&mdash;a sprinkling of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> arising out of the close ties of married life and children. Nevertheless, whatever be the sanctification meant, this must be steadily held: that there is no other valid means of making <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and remitting <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, except by men becoming <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> through the sacrament according to the institution of Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For neither are unbelieving husbands and wives, notwithstanding their intimate union with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and righteous spouses, cleansed of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which separates men from the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and drives them into condemnation, nor are the children who are born of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, however just and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, absolved from the guilt of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless they have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ; and in behalf of these our plea should be the more earnest, the less able they are to urge one themselves.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22 [XIII.]&mdash; We Ought to Be Anxious to Secure the Baptism of Infants.</h2>

<p>For this is the point aimed at by the controversy, against the novelty of which we have to struggle by the aid of ancient <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: that it is clearly altogether superfluous for infants to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Not that this opinion is avowed in so many words, lest so firmly established a custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be unable to endure its assailants. But if we are taught to render help to <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, how much more ought we to labour in behalf of those children who, though under the protection of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, will still be left more destitute and wretched than <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, should that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ be denied them, which they are all unable to demand for themselves?</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.&mdash; Epilogue.</h2>

<p>As for what they say, that some men, by the use of their reason, have lived, and do live, in this world without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we should wish that it were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, we should strive to make it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but, at the same time, we should confess that it is not yet <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For to those who wish and strive and worthily <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for this result, whatever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> remain in them are daily remitted because we sincerely <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, <q>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150706"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> Whosoever shall deny that this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is in this life necessary for every righteous man who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except the one Saint of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, greatly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a>, and is utterly incapable of pleasing Him whom he praises. Moreover, if he supposes himself to be such a character, <q>he deceives himself, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note150707"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> &mdash; for no other reason than that he thinks what is false. That Physician, then, who is not needed by the sound, but by the sick, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to heal us, and by healing to perfect us unto <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; and He does not in this world take away death, although inflicted because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, from those whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> He remits, in order that they may enter on their conflict, and overcome the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death with full sincerity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In some cases, too, He declines to help even His righteous servants, so long as they are capable of still higher elevation, to the attainment of a perfect righteousness, in order that (while in His sight no man living is justified ) we may always feel it to be our duty to give Him thanks for mercifully bearing with us, and so, by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> humility, be healed of that first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all our failings, even the swellings of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. This letter, as my intention first sketched it, was to have been a short one; it has grown into a lengthy book. Would that it were as perfect as it has at last become complete!</p>
