<h1>On Patience</h1>

<div class="stiki">
<p>Erasmus infers from the style and language of this piece, that it is not St. Augustine's, putting it in the same category with the treatises <em>On Continence, On substance of Charity, On Faith of things invisible.</em> The Benedictine editors acknowledge that it has peculiarities of style which are calculated to move suspicion; (especially the studied assonances and rhyming endings, e.g. <q> <em>cautior fuit iste in doloribus quam ille in nemoribus . . . consensit ille oblectamentis, non cessit ille tormentis</em>,</q> chap. 12.); yet they feel themselves bound to retain it among the genuine works by Augustine's own testimony, who mentions both this piece and that <em>On Continence</em> in his Epistle to Darius, 231. chap. 7. [Vol. I. 584.] That it is not named in the <em>Retractations</em> is accounted for by the circumstance that it appears to have been delivered as a sermon, see chap. 1. and 3, and Augustine did not live to fulfill his intention of composing a further book of retractations on review of his popular discourses and letters. <em> Ep</em>. 224. chap. 2. In point of matter and doctrine this treatise has nothing contrary to or not in harmony with S. Augustine's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> doctrine and sentiments.</p>
</div>

<p>1. That <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the mind which is called Patience, is so great a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that even in Him who bestows the same upon us, that, whereby He waits for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men that they may amend, is set forth by the name of Patience, [or long-suffering.] So, although in God there can be no suffering,  and <q>patience</q> has its name <em>a patiendo</em>, from suffering, yet a patient God we not only faithfully <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but also wholesomely confess. But the patience of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of what kind and how great it is, His, Whom we say to be impassible,  yet not impatient, nay even most patient, in words to unfold this who can be able? Ineffable is therefore that patience, as is His jealousy, as His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and whatever there is like to these. For if we conceive of these as they be in us, in Him are there none. We, namely, can feel none of these without molestation: but be it far from us to surmise that the impassible nature of God is liable to any molestation. But like as He is jealous without any darkening of spirit,  <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> without any perturbation, pitiful without any pain, <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">repents</a> Him without any wrongness in Him to be set right; so is He patient without anything of passion. Now therefore as concerning <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> patience, which we are able to conceive and beholden to have, of what sort it is, I will, as God grants and the brevity of the present discourse allows, essay to set forth.</p>

<p>2. The patience of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which is right and laudable and worthy of the name of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is understood to be that by which we tolerate <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things with an even <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that we may not with a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> uneven desert <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, through which we may arrive at better. Wherefore the impatient, while they will not suffer ills, effect not a deliverance from ills, but only the suffering of heavier ills. Whereas the patient who choose rather by not committing to bear, than by not bearing to commit, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, both make lighter what through patience they suffer, and also escape worse ills in which through impatience they would be sunk. But those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which are great and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> they lose not, while to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which be temporal and brief they yield not: because <q>the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared,</q> as the Apostle says, <q>with the future <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that shall be revealed in us.</q>  And again he says, <q>This our temporal and light tribulation does in inconceivable manner work for us an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> weight of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> </p>

<p>3. Look we then, beloved, what hardships in labors and sorrows men endure, for things which they viciously <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and by how much they think to be made by them more <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, by so much more unhappily <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>. How much for false riches, how much for vain <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, how much for affections of games and shows, is of exceeding peril and trouble most patiently borne! We see men hankering after money, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, lasciviousness, how, that they may arrive at their desires, and having gotten not lose them, they endure sun, rain, icy cold, waves, and most stormy tempests, the roughnesses and uncertainties of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, the strokes of huge blows, and dreadful wounds, not of inevitable necessity but of culpable will. But these madnesses are thought, in a manner, permitted. Thus <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, ambition, luxury, and the delights of all sorts of games and shows, unless for them some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> deed be committed or outrage which is prohibited by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, are accounted to pertain to innocence: nay moreover, the man who without wrong to any shall, whether for getting or increasing of money, whether for obtaining or keeping of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, whether in contending in the match, or in hunting, or in exhibiting with applause some theatrical spectacle, have borne great labors and pains, it is not enough that through popular vanity he is checked by no reproofs, but he is moreover extolled with praises: <q>Because,</q> as it is written, <q>the sinner is praised in the desires of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q>  For the force of desires makes endurance of labors and pains: and no man save for that which he enjoys, freely takes on him to bear that which annoys. But these <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, as I said, for the fulfilling of which they which are on fire with them most patiently endure much hardship and bitterness, are accounted to be permitted, and allowed by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>.</p>

<p>4. Nay more; for is it not so that even for open wickednesses, not to punish but to perpetrate them, men put up with many most grievous troubles? Do not authors of secular letters tell of a certain right noble parricide of his country, that hunger, thirst, cold, all these he was able to endure, and his body was patient of lack of food and warmth and sleep to a degree surpassing belief?  Why speak of highway <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, all of whom while they lie in wait for travellers endure whole nights without sleep, and that they may catch, as they pass by, men who have no thought of harm, will, no matter how foul the weather, plant in one spot their mind and body, which are full of thoughts of harm? Nay it is said that some of them are wont to torture one another by turns, to that degree that this practice and training against pains is not a whit short of pains. For, not so much perchance are they excruciated by the Judge, that through smart of pain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may be got at, as they are by their own comrades, that through patience of pain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may not be betrayed. And yet in all these the patience is rather to be wondered at than praised: nay neither wondered at nor praised, seeing it is no patience; but we must wonder at the hardness, deny the patience: for there is nothing in this rightly to be praised, nothing usefully to be imitated; and you will rightly judge the mind to be all the more worthy of greater punishment, the more it yields up to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> the instruments of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Patience is companion of wisdom, not handmaid of concupiscence: patience is the friend of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, not the foe of innocence.</p>

<p>5. When therefore you shall see any man suffer anything patiently, do not straightway praise it as patience; for this is only shown by the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of suffering. When it is a good <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, then is it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> patience: when that is not polluted by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, then is this distinguished from falsity. But when that is placed in crime, then is this much misplaced in name. For not just as all who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> are partakers of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, just so are all who suffer partakers of patience: but they which rightly use the suffering, these in verity of patience are praised, these with the prize of patience are crowned.</p>

<p>6. But yet, seeing that for <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>' sake, or even wickednesses, seeing, in a word, that for this temporal life and good men do wonderfully bear the brunt of many horrible sufferings, they much admonish us how great things ought to be borne for the sake of a good life, that it may also hereafter be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and without any bound of time, without waste or loss of any advantage, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> felicity secure. The Lord says, <q>In your patience you shall possess your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>:</q>  He says not, your farms, your praises, your luxuries; but, <q>your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</q> If then the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> endures so great sufferings that it may possess that whereby it may be lost, how great ought it to bear that it may not be lost? And then, to mention a thing not culpable, if it bear so great sufferings for saving of the flesh under the hands of chirurgeons cutting or burning the same, how great ought it to bear for saving of itself under the fury of any soever enemies? Seeing that leeches, that the body may not die, do by pains consult for the body's good; but enemies by threatening the body with pains and death, would urge us on to the slaying of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</p>

<p>7. Though indeed the welfare even of the body is then more providently consulted for if its temporal life and welfare be disregarded for righteousness' sake, and its pain or death most patiently for righteousness' sake endured. Since it is of the body's redemption which is to be in the end, that the Apostle speaks, where he says, <q>Even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting the adoption of sons, the redemption of our body.</q>  Then he subjoins, <q>For in hope are we saved. But hope which is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he also hope for? But if what we see not we hope for, we do by patience wait for it.</q> When therefore any ills do torture us indeed, yet not extort from us ill works, not only is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> possessed through patience; but even when through patience the body itself for a time is afflicted or lost, it is unto <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> stability and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> resumed, and has through grief and death an inviolable health and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> laid up for itself. Whence the Lord Jesus exhorting his Martyrs to patience, has promised of the very body a future perfect entireness, without loss, I say not of any limb, but of a single hair. <q>Verily I say unto you,</q> says He, <q>a hair of your head shall not perish.</q>  That so, because, as the Apostle says, <q>no man ever <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> his own flesh,</q>  a faithful man may more by patience than by impatience take vigilant care for the state of his flesh, and find amends for its present losses, how great soever they may be, in the inestimable gain of future incorruption.</p>

<p>8. But although patience be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, yet partly the mind exercises it in the mind itself, partly in the body. In itself it exercises patience, when, the body remaining unhurt and untouched, the mind is goaded by any adversities or filthinesses of things or words, to do or to say something that is not expedient or not becoming, and patiently bears all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that it may not itself commit any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in work or word. By this patience we bear, even while we be sound in body, that in the midst of the offenses of this world our blessedness is deferred: of which is said what I cited a little before, <q>If what we see not we hope for, we do by patience wait for it.</q> By this patience, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David bore the revilings of a railer,  and, when he might easily have avenged himself, not only did it not, but even refrained another who was vexed and moved for him; and more put forth his kingly power by prohibiting than by exercising vengeance. Nor at that time was his body afflicted with any disease or wound, but there was an acknowledging of a time of humility, and a bearing of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the sake of which there was a drinking of the bitterness of contumely with most patient mind. This patience the Lord taught, when, the servants being moved at the mixing in of the tares and wishing to gather them up, He said that the householder answered, <q>Leave both to grow until the harvest.</q>  That, namely, must be patience put up with, which must not be in haste put away. Of this patience Himself afforded and showed an example, when, before the passion of His Body, He so bore with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> Judas, that ere He pointed him out as the traitor, He endured him as a thief;  and before experience of bonds and cross and death, did, to those lips so full of guile, not deny the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of peace.  All these, and whatever else there be, which it were tedious to rehearse, belong to that manner of patience, by which the mind does, not its own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> but any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> so ever from without, patiently endure in itself, while the body remains altogether unhurt. But the other manner of patience is that by which the same mind bears any troubles and grievances whatsoever in the sufferings of the body; not as do foolish or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men for the sake of getting vain things or perpetrating crimes; but as is defined by the Lord, <q>for righteousness' sake.</q>  In both kinds, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Martyrs contended. For both with scornful reproofs of the ungodly were they filled, where, the body remaining intact, the mind has its own (as it were) blows and wounds, and bears these unbroken: and in their bodies they were bound, imprisoned, vexed with hunger and thirst, tortured, gashed, torn asunder, burned, butchered; and with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> immovable submitted unto God their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, while they were suffering in the flesh all that exquisite cruelty could devise in its mind.</p>

<p>9. It is indeed a greater fight of patience, when it is not a visible enemy that by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and rage would urge us into crime which enemy may openly and in broad day be by not consenting overcome; but the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself, (he who does likewise by means of the children of infidelity, as by his vessels, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the children of light) does by himself hiddenly attack us, by his rage putting us on to do or say something against God. As such had <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Job experience of him, by both <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> vexed, but in both through steadfast strength of patience and arms of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> unconquered. For first, his body being left unhurt, he lost all that he had, in order that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, before excruciation of the flesh, might through withdrawal of the things which men are wont to prize highly, be broken, and he might say something against God upon loss of the things for the sake of which he was thought to worship Him. He was smitten also with sudden bereavement of all his sons so that whom he had begotten one by one he should lose all at once, as though their numerousness had been not for the adorning of his felicity, but for the increasing of his calamity. But where, having endured these things, he remained immovable in his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he cleaved to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, Whom it was not possible to lose but by his own will; and in place of the things he had lost he held Him who took them away, in Whom he should find what should never be lost. For He that took them away was not that enemy who had will of hurting, but He who had given to that enemy the power of hurting. The enemy next attacked also the body, and now not those things which were in the man from without, but the man himself, in whatever part he could, he smote. From the head to the feet were burning pains, were crawling worms, were running sores; still in the rotting body the mind remained entire, and horrid as were the tortures of the consuming flesh, with inviolate <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and uncorrupted patience it endured them all. There stood the wife, and instead of giving her husband any help, was suggesting <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against God. For we are not to think that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, in leaving her when he took away the sons, went to work as one unskilled in mischief: rather, how necessary she was to the tempter, he had already learned in Eve. But now he had not found a second <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> whom he might take by means of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. More cautious was Job in his hours of sadness, than <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> in his bowers of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, the one was overcome in the midst of pleasant things, the other overcame in the midst of pains; the one consented to that which seemed delightsome, this other quailed not in torments most affrightsome. There stood his friends too, not to console him in his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, but to suspect <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in him. For while he suffered so great sorrows, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him not innocent, nor did their tongue forbear to say that which his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> had not to say; that so amid ruthless tortures of the body, his mind also might be beaten with truthless reproaches. But he, bearing in his flesh his own pains, in his heart others' <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, reproved his wife for her folly, taught his friends wisdom, preserved patience in each and all.</p>

<p>10. To this man let them  look who put themselves to death when they are sought for to have life put upon them; and by bereaving themselves of the present, deny and refuse also that which is to come. Why, if people were driving them to deny Christ or to do any thing contrary to righteousness, like <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Martyrs, they ought rather to bear all patiently than to dare death impatiently. If it could be right to do this for the sake of running away from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Job would have killed himself, that being in so great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, in his estate, in his sons, in his limbs, through the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> cruelty, he might escape them all. But he did it not. Far be it from him, a wise man, to commit upon himself what not even that unwise <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> suggested. And if she had suggested it, she would with good reason here also have had that answer which she had when suggesting <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; <q>You have spoken as one of the foolish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. If we have received good at the hand of the Lord, shall we not bear <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>?</q>  Seeing even he also would have lost patience, if either by <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> as she had suggested, or by killing himself which not even she had dared to speak of, he should die, and be among them of whom it is written, <q>Woe unto them that have lost patience!</q>  and rather increase than escape pains, if after the death of his body he should be hurried off to punishment either of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a>, or of murderers, or of them which are worse even than parricides. For if a parricide be on that account more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> than any homicide, because he kills not merely a man but a near relative; and among parricides too, the nearer the person killed, the greater criminal he is judged to be: without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> worse still is he who kills himself, because there is none nearer to a man than himself. What then do these miserable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> mean, who, though both here they have inflicted pain upon themselves, and hereafter not only for their impiety towards God but for the very cruelty which they have exercised upon themselves will deservedly suffer pains of His inflicting, do yet seek moreover the glories of Martyrs? Since, even if for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> testimony of Christ they suffered <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and killed themselves, that they might not suffer any thing from their persecutors, it would be rightly said to them, <q>Woe unto them which have lost patience!</q> For how has patience her just reward, if even an impatient suffering receives the crown? Or how shall that man be judged innocent, to whom is said, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbor as yourself,</q>  if he commit <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> upon himself which he is forbidden to commit upon his neighbor?</p>

<p>11. Let then the Saints hear from <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture the precepts of patience: <q>My son, when you come to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, stand in righteousness and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and prepare your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>: bring your heart low, and bear up; that in the last end your life may increase. All that shall come upon you receive you, and in pain bear up, and in your humility have patience. For in the fire gold and silver is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, but acceptable men in the furnace  of humiliation.</q>  And in another place we read: <q>My son, faint not in the discipline of the Lord, neither be wearied when you are chidden of Him. For whom the Lord loves He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives.</q>  What is here set down, <q>son whom He receives,</q> the same in the above mentioned testimony is, <q>acceptable men.</q> For this is just, that we who from our first felicity of Paradise for contumacious appetence of things to enjoy were dismissed, through <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> patience of things that annoy may be received back: driven away for doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, brought back by suffering <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: there against righteousness doing ill, here for righteousness' sake patient of ills.</p>

<p>12. But concerning <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> patience, worthy of the name of this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whence it is to be had, must now be inquired. For there are some  who attribute it to the strength of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, not which it has by Divine assistance, but which it has of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. Now this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> one: for it is the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of them which abound, of whom it is said in the Psalm, <q>A scornful reproof to them which abound, and a despising to the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>.</q>  It is not therefore that <q>patience of the poor</q> which <q>perishes not forever.</q>  For these poor receive it from that Rich One, to Whom is said, <q>My God are You, because my goods You need not:</q>  of Whom is <q>every good gift, and every perfect gift;</q>  to Whom cries the needy and the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and in asking, seeking, knocking, says, <q>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, deliver me from the hand of the sinner, and from the hand of the lawless and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>: because You are my patience, O Lord, my hope from my youth up.</q>  But these which abound, and disdain to be in want before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lest they receive of Him <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> patience, they which <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in their own false patience, seek to <q>confound the counsel of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, because the Lord is his hope.</q>  Nor do they regard, seeing they are men, and attribute so much to their own, that is, to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, that they run into that which is written, <q>Cursed is every one who puts his hope in man.</q>  Whence even if it chance them that they do bear up under any hardships or difficulties, either that they may not displease men, or that they may not suffer worse, or in self-pleasing and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of their own presumption, do with most <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> will bear up under these same, it is meet that concerning patience this be said unto them, which concerning wisdom the blessed Apostle James says, <q>This wisdom comes not from above, but is earthly, animal, devilish.</q>  For why may there not be a false patience of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, as there is a false wisdom of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>? But from Whom comes <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom, from Him comes also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> patience. For to Him sings that poor in spirit, <q>Unto God is my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> subjected, because from Him is my patience.</q> </p>

<p>13. But they answer and speak, saying, <q>If the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of man without any aid of God by strength of free choice  bears so many grievous and horrible distresses, whether in mind or body, that it may enjoy the delight of this mortal life and of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, why may it not be that in the same manner the self-same will of man by the same strength of free-choice, not thereunto looking to be aided of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but unto itself by natural possibility sufficing, does, in all of labor or sorrow that is put upon it, for righteousness and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life's sake most patiently sustain the same? Or is it so, say they, that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> is sufficient, without aid of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for them, yea even to exercise themselves in undergoing torture for iniquity, and before they be tortured by others; sufficient the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of them which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the respiting of this life that, without aid of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they should in the midst of most atrocious and protracted torments persevere in a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, lest confessing their misdeeds they be ordered to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>; and not sufficient the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the just, unless strength be put into them from above, that whatever be their pains, they should, either for beauty's sake of very righteousness or for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, bear the same?</q></p>

<p>14. They which say these things, do not understand that as well each one of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> is in that measure for endurance of any ills more hard, in what measure the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the world is mightier in him; as also that each one of the just is in that measure for endurance of any ills more brave, in what measure in him the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is mightier. But <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the world has its beginning from choice of the will, its progress from enjoyableness of pleasure, its confirmation from the chain of custom, whereas <q>the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts,</q>  not verily from ourselves, but <q>by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> which is given unto us.</q> And therefore from Him comes the patience of the just, by Whom is shed abroad their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (of Him). Which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (of charity) the Apostle praising and setting off, among its other good qualities, says, that it <q>bears all things.</q>  <q>Charity,</q> says he, <q>is magnanimous.</q>  And a little after he says, <q>endures all things.</q> The greater then is in <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> the charity (or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>) of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the more do they endure all things for Him whom they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and the greater in sinners the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the world, the more do they endure all things for that which they <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after. And consequently from that same source comes <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> patience of the righteous, from which there is in them the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and from that same source the false patience of the unrighteous, from which is in them the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the world. With regard to which the Apostle John says; <q>Love not the world, neither the things that be in the world. If any man <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father is not in him: because all that is in the world, is <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes, and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life;  which is not of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but is of the world.</q>  This concupiscence, then, which is not of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but is of the world, in what measure it shall in any man be more vehement and ardent, in that measure becomes each more patient of all troubles and sorrows for that which he <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> after. Therefore, as we said above, this is not the patience which descends from above, but the patience of the godly is from above, coming down from the Father of lights. And so that is earthly, this heavenly; that animal, this spiritual; that devilish, this Godlike.  Because concupiscence, whereof it comes that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> sinning suffer all things stubbornly, is of the world; but charity, whereof comes that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> living aright suffer all things bravely, is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And therefore to that false patience it is possible that, without aid of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will may suffice; harder, in proportion as it is more eager of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and bearing ills with the more endurance the worse itself becomes: while to this, which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> patience, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, unless aided and inflamed from above, does not suffice, for the very reason that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is the fire thereof; by Whom unless it be kindled to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that impassible Good, it is not able to bear the ill which it suffers.</p>

<p>15. For, as the Divine utterances testify, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and he that dwells in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> dwells in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God dwells in him.</q>  Whoso therefore contends that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God may be had without aid of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what else does he contend, but that God may be had without God? Now what <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> would say this, which no madman would venture to say? Therefore in the Apostle, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, faithful patience, says exultingly, and by the mouth of the Saints; <q>Who shall separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For Your sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us:</q> not through ourselves, but, <q>through Him that loved us.</q>  And then he goes on and adds; <q>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>.</q> This is that <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God</q> which <q>is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> which is given unto us.</q> But the concupiscence of the bad, by reason of which there is in them a false patience, <q>is not of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q>  as says the Apostle John, but is of the world.</p>

<p>16. Here some man shall say; <q>If the concupiscence of the bad, whereby it comes that they bear all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> for that which they <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after, be of the world, how is it said to be of their will?</q> As if, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, they were not themselves also of the world, when they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world, forsaking Him by Whom the world was made. For <q>they serve the creature more than the Creator, Who is blessed for ever.</q>  Whether then by the word <q>world,</q> the Apostle John signifies lovers of the world, the will, as it is of themselves, is therefore of the world: or whether under the name of the world he comprises heaven and earth, and all that is therein, that is the creature universally, it is plain that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the creature, not being that of the Creator, is of the world. For which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to such the Lord says, <q>You are from beneath, I am from above: you are of this world, I am not of this world.</q>  And to the Apostle He says, <q>If you were of the world, the world would <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> his own.</q> But lest they should arrogate more unto themselves than their measure craved, and when He said that they were not of the world, should <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> this to be of nature, not of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, therefore He says, <q>But because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> you.</q> It follows, that they once were of the world: for, that they might not be of the world, they were chosen out of the world.</p>

<p>17. Now this election the Apostle demonstrating to be, not of merits going before in good works, but election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, says thus: <q>And in this time a remnant by election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is saved. But if by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, then is it no more of works, otherwise <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is no more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q>  This is election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; that is, election in which through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God men are elected: this, I say, is election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which goes before all good merits of men. For if it be to any good merits that it is given, then is it no more gratuitously given, but is paid as a debt, and consequently is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> called <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; where <q>reward,</q> as the same Apostle says, <q>is not imputed as <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but as debt.</q>  Whereas if, that it may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that is, gratuitous, it find nothing in man to which it is due of merit, (which thing is well understood in that saying, <q>You will save them for nothing,</q> ) then assuredly itself gives the merits, not to merits is given. Consequently it goes before even <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, from which it is that all good works begin. <q>For the just,</q> as is written, <q>shall live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q>  But, moreover, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> not only assists the just, but also justifies the ungodly. And therefore even when it does aid the just and seems to be rendered to his merits, not even then does it cease to be <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, because that which it aids it did itself bestow. With a view therefore to this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which precedes all good merits of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not only was Christ <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the ungodly, but <q>died for the ungodly.</q>  And ere that He died, He elected the Apostles, not of course then just, but to be justified: to whom He says, <q>I have chosen you out of the world.</q> For to whom He said, <q>You are not of the world,</q> and then, lest they should account themselves never to have been of the world, presently added, <q>But I have chosen you out of the world;</q> assuredly that they should not be of the world was by His own election of them conferred upon them. Wherefore, if it had been through their own righteousness, not through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that they were elected, they would not have been chosen out of the world, because they would already not be of the world if already they were just. And again, if the reason why they were elected was, that they were already just, they had already first chosen the Lord. For who can be righteous but by choosing righteousness? <q>But the end of the law is Christ, for righteousness is to every one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>.  Who is made unto us wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that, as it is written, He that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a>, let him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord.</q>  He then is Himself our righteousness.</p>

<p>18. Whence also the just of old, before the Incarnation of the Word, in this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and in this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> righteousness, (which thing Christ is unto us,) were justified; believing this to come which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> come: and they themselves by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> were saved through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not of themselves, but by the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not of works, lest haply they should be lifted up.  For their good works did not come before God's mercy, but followed it. For to them was it said, and by them written, long ere Christ had come in the flesh, <q>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will show compassion on whom I will have compassion.</q>  From which words of God the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, should so long after say; <q>It is not therefore of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy.</q> It is also their own voice, long ere Christ had come in the flesh, <q>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, His mercy shall prevent me.</q>  How indeed could they be aliens from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by whose charity even Christ was fore-announced unto us; without the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Whom, not any of mortals either has been, or is, or ever shall be able to be, righteous? If then, being already just, the Apostles were elected by Christ, they would have first chosen Him, that just men might be chosen, because without Him they could not be just. But it was not so: as Himself says to them, <q>Not you have chosen Me, but I have chosen you.</q> Of which the Apostle John speaks, <q>Not that we loved <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that He loved us.</q> </p>

<p>19. Since the case is so, what is man, while in this life he uses his own proper will, ere he choose and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but unrighteous and ungodly? <q>What,</q> I say, <q>is man,</q> a creature going astray from the Creator, unless his Creator <q>be mindful of him,</q>  and choose  him freely, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>  him freely? Because he is himself not able to choose or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, unless being first chosen and loved he be healed, because by choosing blindness he perceives not, and by loving laziness is soon wearied. But perchance some man may say: In what manner is it that God first chooses and loves <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> men, that He may justify them, when it is written, <q>You hate, Lord, all that work iniquity?</q>  In what way, think we, but in a wonderful and ineffable manner? And yet even we are able to conceive, that the good Physician both <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> and loves the sick man: <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> him, because he is sick; loves him, that he may drive away his sickness.</p>

<p>20. Let thus much have been said with regard to charity, without which in us there cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> patience, because in good men it is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God which endures all things, as in bad men the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the world. But this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is in us by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> which was given us. Whence, of Whom comes in us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, of Him comes patience. But the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the world, when it patiently bears the burdens of any manner of calamity, boasts of the strength of its own will, like as of the stupor of disease, not robustness of health. This boasting is insane: it is not the language of patience, but of dotage. A will like this in that degree seems more patient of bitter ills, in which it is more greedy of temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, because more empty of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>

<p>21. But if it be goaded on and inflamed with deceitful visions and unclean incentives by the devilish spirit, associated and conspiring therewith in malignant agreement, this spirit makes the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the man either frantic with <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, or burning with appetite of some worldly delight; and hence, it seems to show a marvellous endurance of intolerable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>: but yet it does not follow from this that an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will without instigation of another and unclean spirit, like as a good will without aid of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, cannot exist. For that there may be an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will even without any spirit either seducing or inciting, is sufficiently clear in the instance of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself, who is found to have become a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, not through some other <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, but of his own proper will. An <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will therefore, whether it be hurried on by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, whether called back by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, whether expanded by <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, whether contracted by sadness, and in all these perturbations of mind enduring and making light of whatever are to others, or at another time, more grievous, this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will may, without another spirit to goad it on, seduce itself, and in lapsing by defection from the higher to the lower, the more pleasant it shall account that thing to be which it seeks to get or fears to lose, or rejoices to have gotten, or grieves to have lost, the more tolerably for its sake bear what is less for it to suffer than that is to be enjoyed. For whatever that thing be, it is of the creature, of which one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the pleasure. Because in some sort, the creature loved approaches itself to the creature loving in fond contact and connection, to the giving experience of its sweetness.</p>

<p>22. But the pleasure of the Creator, of which is written, <q>And from the river of Your pleasure will You give them to drink,</q>  is of far other kind, for it is not, like us, a creature. Unless then its <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> be given to us from thence there is no source whence it may be in us. And consequently, a good will, by which we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot be in man, save in whom God also works to will. This good will therefore, that is, a will faithfully subjected to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  a will set on fire by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of that ardor which is above, a will which loves God and his neighbor for God's sake; whether through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, of which the Apostle Peter makes answer, <q>Lord, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> You;</q>  whether through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, of which says the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, <q>In <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling work out your own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>;</q>  whether through <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, of which he says, <q>In hope rejoicing, in tribulation patient;</q>  whether through sorrow, with which he says he had great grief for his brethren;  in whatever way it endure what bitterness and hardships soever, it is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God which <q>endures all things,</q>  and which is not shed abroad in our hearts but by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> given unto us.  Whereof <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> makes no manner of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, but, as the charity of them which holily <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, so the patience of them which piously endure, is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it cannot be that the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> deceives or is deceived, which not only in the Old Books has testimonies of this thing, when it is said unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>My Patience are You,</q> and, <q>From Him is my patience;</q>  and where another <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, that we receive the spirit of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>;  but also in the Apostolic writings we read, <q>Because unto you is given on behalf of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not only to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, but to suffer for Him.</q>  Therefore let not that make the mind to be as of its own merit uplifted, wherewith he is told that he is of Another's mercy gifted.</p>

<p>23. But if moreover any not having charity, which pertains to the unity of spirit and the bond of peace whereby the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is gathered and knit together, being involved in any <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, does, that he may not deny Christ, suffer tribulations, straits, hunger, nakedness, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, perils, prisons, bonds, torments, swords, or flames, or wild beasts, or the very cross, through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>; in nowise is all this to be blamed, nay rather this also is a patience meet to be praised. For we cannot say that it would have been better for him that by denying Christ he should suffer none of these things, which he did suffer by confessing Him: but we must account that it will perhaps be more tolerable for him in the judgment, than if by denying Christ he should avoid all those things: so that what the Apostle says, <q>If I shall give my body to be burned, but have not charity, it profits me nothing,</q>  should be understood to profit nothing for obtaining the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, but not for having more tolerable punishment to undergo in the last judgment.</p>

<p>24.  But it may well be asked, whether this patience likewise be the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or to be attributed to strength of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, by which patience, one who is separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does, not for the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which separated him but for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Sacrament or Word which has remained with him, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of pains <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> suffer pains temporal. For we must take heed lest haply, if we affirm that patience to be the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they in whom it is should be thought to belong also to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>; but if we deny it to be the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we should be compelled to allow that without aid and gift of God there can be in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of man somewhat of good. Because it is not to be denied that it is a good thing that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> he shall undergo pain of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment if he shall deny Christ, and for that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> endure and make light of any manner of punishment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> inflicting.</p>

<p>25. So then, as we are not to deny that this is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we are thus to understand that there be some gifts of God possessed by the sons of that Jerusalem which is above,  and free, and mother of us all, (for these are in some sort the hereditary possessions in which we are <q>heirs of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and joint-heirs with Christ:</q>) but some other which may be received even by the sons of concubines to whom carnal <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and schismatics or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are compared. For though it be written, <q>Cast out the bondmaid and her son, for the son of the bondmaid shall not be heir with my son Isaac:</q>  and though God said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <q>In Isaac shall your seed be called:</q> which the Apostle has so interpreted as to say, <q>That is, not they which be sons of the flesh, these be the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but the sons of the promise are counted for the seed;</q>  that we might understand the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in regard of Christ to pertain by reason of Christ to the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who are Christ's body and members, that is to say, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, one, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, very-begotten, catholic, holding the godly <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; not the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which works through elation or <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but <q>which works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>;</q>  nevertheless, even the sons of the concubines, when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> sent them away from his son Isaac, he did not omit to bestow upon them some gifts, that they might not be left in every way empty, but not that they should be held as heirs. For so we read: <q>And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> gave all his estate unto Isaac; and to the sons of his concubines gave <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> gifts, and sent them away from his son Isaac.</q>  If then we be sons of Jerusalem the free, let us understand that other be the gifts of them which are put out of the inheritance, other the gifts of them which be heirs. For these be the heirs, to whom is said, <q>You have not received the spirit of bondage again to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</q> </p>

<p>26. Cry we therefore with the spirit of charity, and until we come to the inheritance in which we are always to remain, let us be, through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which becomes the free-born, not through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> which becomes bondmen, patient of suffering. Cry we, so long as we are poor, until we be with that inheritance made rich. Seeing how great earnest thereof we have received, in that Christ to make us rich made Himself poor; Who being exalted unto the riches which are above, there was sent One Who should breathe into our hearts <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> longings, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Of these poor, as yet believing, not yet beholding; as yet hoping, not yet enjoying; as yet sighing in desire, not yet reigning in felicity; as yet hungering and thirsting, not yet satisfied: of these poor, then, <q>the patience shall not perish for ever:</q>  not that there will be patience there also, where anything to endure shall not be; but <q>will not perish,</q> meaning that it will not be unfruitful. But its fruit it will have for ever, therefore it <q>shall not perish for ever.</q> For he who labors in vain, when his hope fails for which he labored, says with good <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, <q>I have lost so much labor:</q> but he who comes to the promise of his labor says, congratulating himself, I have not lost my labor. Labor then is said not to perish (or be lost), not because it lasts perpetually, but because it is not spent in vain. So also the patience of the poor of Christ (who yet are to be made rich as heirs of Christ) shall not perish for ever: not because there also we shall be commanded patiently to bear, but because for that which we have here patiently borne, we shall enjoy <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> bliss. He will put no end to everlasting felicity, Who gives temporal patience unto the will: because both the one and the other is of Him bestowed as a gift upon charity, Whose gift that charity is also.</p>
