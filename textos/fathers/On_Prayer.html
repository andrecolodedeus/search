<h1>On Prayer</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. General Introduction.</h2> 

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and the Reason of God&mdash; Word of Reason, and Reason and Spirit of Word&mdash; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, namely, who is both the one and the other, &mdash; has determined for us, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, a new form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; for in this particular also it was needful that new wine should be laid up in new skins, and a new breadth be sewn to a new garment.  Besides, whatever had been in bygone days, has either been quite changed, as <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; or else supplemented, as the rest of the Law; or else fulfilled, as Prophecy; or else perfected, as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself. For the new <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God has renewed all things from carnal unto spiritual, by superinducing the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, the obliterator of the whole ancient bygone system; in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> has been approved as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and the Reason of God: the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, by which He was mighty; the Word, by which He taught; the Reason, by which He came.  So the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> composed by Christ has been composed of three parts. In speech,  by which <em><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a></em> is enunciated, in spirit, by which alone it prevails, even John had taught his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>,  but all John's doings were laid as groundwork for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, until, when <q>He had increased</q>&mdash; just as the same John used to fore-announce <q>that it was needful</q> that <q>He should increase and himself decrease</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038766"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;3:30</a></span> &mdash; the whole work of the forerunner passed over, together with his spirit itself, unto the Lord. Therefore, after what form of words John taught to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> is not extant, because earthly things have given place to heavenly. <q>He who is from the earth,</q> says John, <q>speaks earthly things; and He who is here from the heavens speaks those things which He has seen.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038767"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;3:31-32</a></span> And what is the Lord Christ's&mdash; as this method of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> is&mdash; <em>that</em> is <em>not</em> heavenly? And so, blessed <em>brethren</em>, let us consider His heavenly wisdom: first, touching the precept of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> secretly, whereby He exacted man's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that he should be confident that the sight and hearing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> are present beneath roofs, and extend even into the secret place; and required modesty in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that it should offer its religious homage to Him alone, whom it <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to see and to hear everywhere. Further, since wisdom succeeded in the following precept, let it in like manner appertain unto <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the modesty of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that we think not that the Lord must be approached with a train of words, who, we are certain, takes unsolicited foresight for His own. And yet that very brevity&mdash; and let this make for the third grade of wisdom&mdash; is supported on the substance of a great and blessed interpretation, and is as diffuse in meaning as it is compressed in words. For it has embraced not only the special duties of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, be it veneration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or petition for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but almost every discourse of the Lord, every record of <em>His</em> Discipline; so that, in fact, in the Prayer is comprised an epitome of the whole <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. The First Clause</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> begins with a testimony to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with the reward of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when we say, <q>Our Father who art in the heavens;</q> for (in so saying), we at once <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and commend <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whose reward this appellation is. It is written, <q>To them who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him He gave power to be called sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038768"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;1:12</a></span> However, our Lord very frequently proclaimed God as a Father to us; nay, even gave a precept <q>that we call no one on earth father, but the Father whom we have in the heavens:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038769"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;23:9</a></span> and so, in thus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, we are likewise <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> the precept. Happy they who recognize their Father! This is the reproach that is brought against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to which the Spirit attests heaven and earth, saying, <q>I have begotten sons, and they have not recognized me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038770"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;1:2</a></span> Moreover, in saying <q>Father,</q> we also call Him <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> That appellation is one both of filial duty and of power. Again, in the Father the Son is invoked; <q>for I,</q> says He, <q>and the Father are One.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038771"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span> Nor is even our mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> passed by, if, that is, in the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is recognized the mother, from whom arises the name both of Father and of Son. In one general term, then, or word, we both <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, together with His own,  and are mindful of the precept, and set a mark on such as have forgotten their Father.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. The Second Clause</h2>

<p>The name of <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father</q> had been published to none. Even <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who had interrogated Him on that very point, had heard a different name. <span class="stiki" id="note038773"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse13">Exodus&nbsp;3:13-16</a></span> To us it has been revealed in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, for the Son is now the Father's new name. <q>I have come,</q> says He, <q>in the Father's name;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038774"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse43">John&nbsp;5:43</a></span> and again, <q>Father, glorify Your name;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038775"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;12:28</a></span> and more openly, <q>I have manifested Your name to men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038776"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;17:6</a></span> That <em>name</em>, therefore, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> may <q>be hallowed.</q> Not that it is becoming for men to <em>wish</em> God <em>well</em>, as if there were any other  by whom He may be wished well, or as if He would suffer unless we do so wish. Plainly, it is universally becoming for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be <em>blessed</em>  in every place and time, on account of the memory of His benefits ever due from every man. But this petition also serves the turn of a blessing. Otherwise, when is the name of God not <q><a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,</q> and <q>hallowed</q> through Himself, seeing that of Himself He sanctifies all others&mdash; He to whom that surrounding circle of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cease not to say, <q>Holy, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>?</q>  In like wise, therefore, we too, candidates for angelhood, if we succeed in deserving it, begin even here on earth to learn by heart that strain hereafter to be raised unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the function of future <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. So far, for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On the other hand, for our own petition, when we say, <q>Hallowed be Your name,</q> we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> this; that it may be hallowed <em>in us</em> who are in Him, as well in all others for whom the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is still waiting; <span class="stiki" id="note038780"><a href="../bible/isa030.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;30:18</a></span> that we may <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> this precept, too, in <q><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for all,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038781"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:1</a></span> even for our personal enemies. <span class="stiki" id="note038782"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;5:44</a></span> And therefore with suspended utterance, not saying, <q>Hallowed be it <em>in us</em>,</q> we say&mdash;<q> <em>in all</em>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 4. The Third Clause</h2>

<p>According to this model,  we subjoin, <q>Your will be done in the heavens and on the earth;</q>  not that there is some power withstanding  to prevent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> being done, and we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for Him the successful achievement of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; but we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to be done <em>in all</em>. For, by figurative interpretation of <em>flesh</em> and <em>spirit, we</em> are <q>heaven</q> and <q>earth;</q> albeit, even if it is to be understood simply, still the sense of the petition is the same, that <em>in us</em> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> be done on earth, to make it possible, namely, for it to be done also in the heavens. What, moreover, <em>does</em> God will, but that we should walk according to His Discipline? We make petition, then, that He supply us with the substance of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and the capacity to do it, that we may be saved both in the heavens and on earth; because the sum of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of them whom He has adopted. There is, too, that <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which the Lord accomplished in preaching, in working, in enduring: for if He Himself proclaimed that He did not His own, but the Father's will, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> those things which He used to do <em>were</em> the Father's will; <span class="stiki" id="note038786"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;6:38</a></span> unto which things, as unto exemplars, we are now provoked;  to preach, to work, to endure even unto death. And we <em>need</em> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we may be able to fulfil these duties. Again, in saying, <q>Your will be done,</q> we are even wishing well to ourselves, in so far that there is nothing of <em><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></em> in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; even if, proportionably to each one's deserts, somewhat other  is imposed on us. So by this expression we premonish our own selves unto patience. The Lord also, when He had wished to demonstrate to us, even in His own flesh, the flesh's infirmity, by the reality of suffering, said, <q>Father, remove this Your cup;</q> and remembering Himself, <em>added</em>, <q>save that not my will, but Yours be done.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038789"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;22:42</a></span> Himself <em>was</em> the Will and the Power of the Father: and yet, for the demonstration of the patience which was due, He gave Himself up <em>to</em> the Father's Will.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. The Fourth Clause</h2>

<p><q>Your kingdom come</q> has also reference to that whereto <q>Your will be done</q> refers&mdash; <em>in us</em>, that is. For when does God not reign, in whose hand is the heart of all kings? <span class="stiki" id="note038790"><a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;21:1</a></span> But whatever we wish for ourselves we augur for Him, and <em>to</em> Him we attribute what <em>from</em> Him we expect. And so, if the <em>manifestation</em> of the Lord's kingdom pertains unto the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and unto our anxious expectation, how do some <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for some protraction of the age,  when the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, which we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> may arrive, tends unto the consummation of the age?  Our wish is, that our reign be hastened, not our servitude protracted. Even if it had not been prescribed in the Prayer that we should ask for the advent of the kingdom, we should, unbidden, have sent forth that cry, hastening toward the realization of our hope. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> beneath the altar  cry in jealousy unto the Lord, <q>How long, Lord, do You not avenge our blood on the inhabitants of the earth?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038794"><a href="../bible/rev006.htm#verse10">Revelation&nbsp;6:10</a></span> for, of course, their avenging is regulated by  the end of the age. Nay, Lord, Your kingdom come with all speed&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the confusion of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>,  the exultation of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, for the sake of which we suffer, nay, rather, for the sake of which we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>!</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. The Fifth Clause</h2>

<p>But how gracefully has the Divine Wisdom arranged the order of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; so that <em>after</em> things heavenly&mdash; that is, after the <q>Name</q> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <q>Will</q> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <q>Kingdom</q> of God&mdash; it should give earthly necessities also room for a petition! For the Lord had  withal issued His edict, <q>Seek first the kingdom, and then even these shall be added:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038798"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;6:33</a></span> albeit we may rather understand, <q>Give us this day our daily bread,</q> <em>spiritually</em>. For <em>Christ</em> is our Bread; because Christ is Life, and bread is life. <q>I am,</q> says He, <q>the Bread of Life;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038799"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;6:35</a></span> and, a little above, <q>The Bread is the Word of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who came down from the heavens.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038800"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;6:33</a></span> Then <em>we find</em>, too, that His body is reckoned in bread: <q>This is my body.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038801"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;26:26</a></span> And so, in petitioning for <q>daily bread,</q> we ask for perpetuity in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and indivisibility from His body. But, because that word is admissible in a carnal sense too, it cannot be so used without the religious remembrance withal of spiritual Discipline; for (the Lord) commands that <em>bread</em> be <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for, which is the only <em>food</em> necessary for <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>; for <q>all other things the nations seek after.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038802"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;6:32</a></span> The like lesson He both inculcates by examples, and repeatedly handles in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, when He says, <q>Does a father take away <em>bread</em> from his children, and hand it to dogs?</q>  and again, <q>Does a father give his son a stone when he asks for <em>bread</em>?</q>  For He <em>thus</em> shows what it is that sons expect from their father. Nay, even that nocturnal knocker knocked for <q> <em>bread</em>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038805"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;11:5-9</a></span> Moreover, He <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> added, <q>Give us <em>this day</em>,</q> seeing He had previously said, <q>Take no careful thought about the morrow, what you are to eat.</q>  To which subject He also adapted the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the man who pondered on an enlargement of his barns for his forthcoming fruits, and on seasons of prolonged security; but that very night he dies. <span class="stiki" id="note038807"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;12:16-20</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The Sixth Clause</h2>

<p>It was suitable that, after contemplating the liberality of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  we should likewise address His clemency. For what will aliments  profit us, if we are really <em>consigned</em> to them, as it were a bull destined for a victim?  The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Himself to be the only guiltless One, and so He teaches that we beg <q>to have our debts remitted us.</q> A petition for pardon is a full confession; because he who begs for pardon fully admits his guilt. Thus, too, penitence is demonstrated acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who desires it rather than the death of the sinner.  Moreover, <em>debt</em> is, in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, a figure of <em>guilt</em>; because it is equally due to the sentence of judgment, and is exacted by it: nor does it evade the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of exaction, unless the exaction be remitted, just as the lord remitted to that slave <em>in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a></em> his debt; <span class="stiki" id="note038812"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;18:21-35</a></span> for hither does the scope of the whole <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> tend. For the fact withal, that the same servant, after liberated by his lord, does not equally spare his own debtor; and, being on that account impeached before his lord, is made over to the tormentor to pay the uttermost farthing&mdash; that is, every guilt, however small: corresponds with our profession that <q>we also remit to our debtors;</q> indeed elsewhere, too, in conformity with this Form of Prayer, He says, <q>Remit, and it shall be remitted you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038813"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse37">Luke&nbsp;6:37</a></span> And when Peter had put the question whether remission were to be granted to a brother seven times, <q>Nay,</q> says He, <q>seventy-seven times;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038814"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;18:21-22</a></span> in order to remould the Law for the better; because in Genesis <em>vengeance</em> was assigned <q>seven times</q> in the case of Cain, but in that of Lamech <q>seventy-seven times.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 8. The Seventh or Final Clause</h2>

<p>For the completeness of so brief a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> He added&mdash; in order that we should supplicate not touching the remitting merely, but touching the entire averting, of acts of guilt&mdash; <q>Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>:</q> that is, suffer us not to be led into it, by him (of course) who tempts; but far be the thought that the Lord should seem to tempt,  as if He either were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of any, or else were eager to overthrow it. Infirmity  and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>  are characteristics of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For <em>God</em> had commanded even <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to make a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of his son, for the sake not of tempting, but proving, his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; in order through him to make an example for that precept of His, whereby He was, by and by, to enjoin that he should hold no pledges of affection dearer than God.  He Himself, when tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, demonstrated who it is that presides over and is the originator of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.  This passage He confirms by subsequent ones, saying, <q>Pray that you be not tempted;</q>  yet they <em>were</em> tempted, (as they showed) by deserting their Lord, because they had given way rather to sleep than <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.  The final clause, therefore, is consonant, and interprets the sense of <q>Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>;</q> for this <em>sense</em> is, <q>But convey us away from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Recapitulation.</h2> 

<p>In summaries of so few words, how many utterances of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>&mdash; how many discourses, examples, <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> of the Lord, are touched on! How many duties are simultaneously discharged! The <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <q>Father;</q> the testimony of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <q>Name;</q> the offering of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> in the <q>Will;</q> the commemoration of hope in the <q>Kingdom;</q> the petition for life in the <q>Bread;</q> the full acknowledgment of debts in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for their <q>Forgiveness;</q> the anxious dread of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> in the request for <q>Protection.</q> What wonder? God alone could teach how he wished Himself <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to. The religious rite of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> therefore, ordained by Himself, and animated, even at the moment when it was issuing out of the Divine mouth, by His own Spirit, ascends, by its own prerogative, into heaven, commending to the Father what the Son has taught.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. We May Superadd Prayers of Our Own to the Lord's Prayer</h2>

<p>Since, however, the Lord, the Foreseer of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> necessities,  said separately, after delivering His Rule of Prayer, <q>Ask, and you shall receive;</q>  and <em>since</em> there are petitions which are made according to the circumstances of each individual; our additional wants have the right&mdash; after beginning with the legitimate and customary <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> as a foundation, as it were&mdash; of rearing an outer superstructure of petitions, yet with remembrance of <em>the Master's</em> precepts.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. When Praying the Father, You are Not to Be Angry with a Brother</h2>

<p>That we may not be as far from the ears of God as we are from His precepts,  the memory of His precepts paves for our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> a way unto heaven; of which <em>precepts</em> the chief is, that we go not up unto God's altar  before we compose whatever of discord or offense we have contracted with our brethren. <span class="stiki" id="note038828"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;5:22-23</a></span> For what sort of deed is it to approach the peace of God  without peace? The remission of debts  while you retain them? How will he appease his <em>Father</em> who is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his <em>brother</em>, when from the beginning <q>all <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a></q> is forbidden us?  For even Joseph, when dismissing his brethren for the purpose of fetching their father, said, <q>And be not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> in the way.</q>  He warned <em>us</em>, to be sure, at that time (for elsewhere our Discipline is called <q>the Way</q> ), that when, set in <q>the way</q> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, we go not unto <q>the Father</q> with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. After that, the Lord, <q>amplifying the Law,</q>  openly adds <em>the prohibition of</em> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against a brother to <em>that of</em> <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note038835"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;5:21-22</a></span> Not even by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> word does He permit it to be vented.  Ever if we <em>must</em> be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, our <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> must not be maintained beyond sunset, as the apostle admonishes. <span class="stiki" id="note038837"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse26">Ephesians&nbsp;4:26</a></span> But how rash is it either to pass a day without <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, while you refuse to make satisfaction to your brother; or else, by perseverance in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, to lose your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. We Must Be Free Likewise from All Mental Perturbation</h2>

<p>Nor merely from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but altogether from <em>all</em> perturbation of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, ought the exercise of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to be free, uttered from a spirit such as the Spirit unto whom it is sent. For a defiled spirit cannot be acknowledged by a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Spirit, <span class="stiki" id="note038838"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse30">Ephesians&nbsp;4:30</a></span> nor a sad by a joyful,  nor a fettered by a free.  No one grants reception to his adversary: no one grants admittance except to his compeer.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Of Washing the Hands</h2>

<p>But what reason is there in going to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with hands indeed washed, but the spirit foul?&mdash; inasmuch as to our hands themselves spiritual purities are necessary, that they may be <q>lifted up pure</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038841"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:8</a></span> from <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, from <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, from cruelty, from poisonings,  from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and all the other blemishes which, conceived by the spirit, are effected by the operation of the hands. These are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> purities;  not those which most are superstitiously careful about, taking water at every <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, even when they are coming from a bath of the whole body. When I was scrupulously making a thorough investigation of this practice, and searching into the reason of it, I ascertained it to be a commemorative act, bearing on the surrender  of our Lord. We, <em>however, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a></em> to the Lord: we do not <em>surrender</em> Him; nay, we ought even to set ourselves in opposition to the example of His surrenderer, and not, on that account, wash our hands. Unless any defilement contracted in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> intercourse be a conscientious <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <em>for washing them</em>, they are otherwise clean enough, which together with our whole body we once washed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Apostrophe</h2>

<p>Albeit <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> washed daily all his limbs over, yet is he never clean. His <em>hands</em>, at all events, are ever unclean, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> dyed with the blood of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and of the Lord Himself; and on that account, as being hereditary culprits from their privity to their fathers' crimes,  they do not dare even to raise them unto the Lord,  for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> some Isaiah should cry out, <span class="stiki" id="note038848"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;1:15</a></span> for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Christ should utterly shudder. We, however, not only raise, but even expand them; and, taking our model from the Lord's passion  even in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> we confess  to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Of Putting Off Cloaks</h2>

<p>But since we have touched on one special point of empty observance,  it will not be irksome to set our brand likewise on the other points against which the reproach of vanity may deservedly be laid; if, that is, they are observed without the authority of any precept either of the Lord, or else of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For matters of this kind belong not to religion, but to <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, being studied, and forced, and of curious rather than rational ceremony;  deserving of restraint, at all events, even on this ground, that they put us on a level with <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.  As, <em>e.g.</em>, it is the custom of some to make <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with cloaks doffed, for so do the nations approach their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; which practice, of course, were its observance becoming, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who teach concerning the garb of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>,  would have comprehended <em>in their instructions</em>, unless any think that is was in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had left his cloak with Carpus! <span class="stiki" id="note038855"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:13</a></span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, forsooth, would not hear cloaked suppliants, who plainly heard the three <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the Babylonian king's furnace <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in their trousers and turbans. </p>

<h2>Chapter 16. Of Sitting After Prayer</h2>

<p>Again, for the custom which some have of sitting when <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is ended, I perceive no reason, except that which children give.  For what if that Hermas,  whose writing is generally inscribed with the title <em>The Shepherd</em>, had, after finishing his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, not sat down on his bed, but done some other thing: should we maintain that also as a matter for observance? Of course not. Why, even as it is the sentence, <q>When I had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and had sat down on my bed,</q> is simply put with a view to the order of the narration, not as a model of discipline. Else we shall have to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> nowhere except where there is a bed! Nay, whoever sits in a <em>chair</em> or on a <em>bench</em>, will act contrary to that writing. Further: inasmuch as the nations do the like, in sitting down after adoring their petty images; even on this account the practice deserves to be censured in us, because it is observed in the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. To this is further added the charge of <em>irreverence</em>&mdash;intelligible even to the nations themselves, if they had any sense. If, on the one hand, it is irreverent to sit under the eye, and over against the eye, of him whom you most of all revere and venerate; how much more, on the other hand, is that deed <em>most</em> irreligious under the eye of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is still <em>standing by</em>  unless we are upbraiding God that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> has wearied us!</p>

<h2>Chapter 17. Of Elevated Hands</h2>

<p>But we more commend our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to God when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with modesty and humility, with not even our hands too loftily elevated, but elevated temperately and becomingly; and not even our countenance over-boldly uplifted. For that <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> with humility and dejection not merely in his supplication, but in his countenance too, went his way <q>more justified</q> than the shameless <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note038860"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;18:9-14</a></span> The sounds of our voice, likewise, should be subdued; else, if we are to be heard for our noise, how large windpipes should we need! But God is the hearer not of the <em>voice</em>, but of the <em>heart</em>, just as He is its inspector. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> of the Pythian oracle says:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<q>And I do understand the mute, and plainly hear the speechless one.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Do the ears of God wait for sound? How, then, could Jonah's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> find way out unto heaven from the depth of the whale's belly, through the entrails of so huge a beast; from the very abysses, through so huge a mass of sea? What superior advantage will they who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> too loudly gain, except that they annoy their neighbours? Nay, by making their petitions audible, what less <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> do they commit than if they were to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in public? </p>

<h2>Chapter 18. Of the Kiss of Peace</h2>

<p>Another custom has now become prevalent. Such as are <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> withhold the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of peace, which is the seal of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, after <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> made with brethren. But when is peace more to be concluded with brethren than when, at the time of some religious observance,  our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> ascends with more acceptability; that they may themselves participate in our observance, and thereby be mollified for transacting with their brother touching their own peace? What <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is complete if <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> from the <q><a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>?</q>  Whom does peace impede when rendering service to his Lord? What kind of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is that from which men depart without peace? Whatever our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> be, it will not be better than the observance of the precept by which we are bidden to conceal our <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note038865"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;6:16-18</a></span> for <em>now</em>, by abstinence from the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, we are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. But even if there be some reason <em>for this practice</em>, still, lest you offend against this precept, you may perhaps defer your <q>peace</q> <em>at home</em>, where it is not possible for your fast to be entirely  kept secret. But wherever else you can conceal your observance, you ought to remember the precept: thus you may satisfy the requirements of Discipline abroad and of custom at home. So, too, on the day of the passover,  when the religious observance of a fast is general, and as it were public, we <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> forego the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, caring nothing to conceal anything which we do in common with all.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19. Of Stations</h2>

<p>Similarly, too, touching the days of Stations,  most think that they must not be present at the sacrificial <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, on the ground that the Station must be dissolved by reception of the Lord's Body. Does, then, the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> cancel a service devoted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or bind it more to God? Will not your <em>Station</em> be more solemn if you have withal <em>stood</em> at God's <em>altar</em>?  When the Lord's Body has been received and reserved  each point is secured, both the participation of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and the discharge of duty. If the <q>Station</q> has received its name from the example of military life&mdash; for we withal are God's military &mdash; of course no <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> or sadness chanting to the camp abolishes the <q>stations</q> of the soldiers: for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> will carry out discipline more willingly, sadness more carefully.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. Of Women's Dress</h2>

<p>So far, however, as regards the dress of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, the variety of observance compels us&mdash; men of no consideration whatever&mdash; to treat, presumptuously indeed, after the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> apostle,  except in so far as it will not be presumptuously if we treat the subject in accordance with the apostle. Touching modesty of dress and ornamentation, indeed, the prescription of Peter <span class="stiki" id="note038872"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:1-6</a></span> likewise is plain, checking as he does with the same mouth, because with the same Spirit, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of garments, and the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of gold, and the meretricious elaboration of the hair.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21. Of Virgins</h2>

<p>But that point which is promiscuously observed throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> ought to be veiled or no, must be treated of. For they who allow to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> immunity from head-covering, appear to rest on this; that the apostle has not defined <q><a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a></q> by name, but <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038873"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:5</a></span> as <q>to be veiled;</q> nor the sex generally, so as to say <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>,</q> but a <em>class</em> of the sex, by saying <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>:</q> for if he had named the sex by saying <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>,</q> he would have made his limit absolute for <em>every</em> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; but while he names one class of the sex, he separates another class by being silent. For, they say, he might either have named <q><a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a></q> specially; or generally, by a compendious term, <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 22. Answer to the Foregoing Arguments</h2>

<p>They who make this concession  ought to reflect on the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the word itself&mdash; what is the meaning of <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a></q> from the very first records of the sacred writings. Here they find it to be the <em>name of the sex</em>, not a <em>class of the sex</em>: if, that is, God gave to Eve, when she had not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the surname <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a></q> and <q>female</q> &mdash; (<q>female,</q> whereby the sex generally; <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q> hereby a class of the sex, is marked).  So, since at that time the as yet unwedded Eve was called by the word <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q> that word has been made common even to a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>.  Nor is it wonderful that the apostle&mdash; guided, of course, by the same Spirit by whom, as all the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>, so that book Genesis, was drawn up&mdash; has used the selfsame word in writing <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>,</q> which, by the example of Eve unwedded, is applicable too to a <q>virgin.</q> In fact, all the other passages are in consonance herewith. For even by this very fact, that he has not <em>named</em> <q><a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a></q> (as he does in another place  where he is teaching touching marrying), he sufficiently predicates that his remark is made touching <em>every</em> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and touching <em>the whole</em> sex; and that there is no distinction made between a <q>virgin</q> <em>and any other</em>, while he does not name her at all. For he who elsewhere&mdash; namely, where the difference requires&mdash; remembers to make the distinction, (moreover, he makes it by designating each species by their appropriate names,) wishes, where he makes <em>no</em> distinction (while he does not name each), <em>no</em> difference to be understood. What of the fact that in the Greek speech, in which the apostle wrote his letters, it is usual to say, <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a></q> rather than <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>;</q> that is, <span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x1FD6;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span> (<em>gunaikas</em>) rather than <span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B7;&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span> (<em>theleias</em>)? Therefore if that word,  which by interpretation represents what <q>female</q> (<em>femina</em>) represents,  is frequently used <em>instead</em> of the name of the sex,  he has named the <em>sex</em> in saying <span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x1FD6;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;</span>; but in the <em>sex</em> even the <em>virgin</em> is embraced. But, withal, the declaration is plain: <q> <em>Every</em> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q> says he, <q><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and prophesying with head uncovered,  dishonours her own head.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038883"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:5</a></span> What is <q> <em>every</em> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q> but <em><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a></em> of every age, of every rank, of every condition? By saying <q>every</q> he excepts nought of womanhood, just as he excepts nought of manhood either from <em>not</em> being covered; for just so he says, <q> <em>Every man</em>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038884"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:4</a></span> As, then, in the masculine sex, under the name of <q>man</q> even the <q>youth</q> is <em>forbidden</em> to be veiled; so, too, in the feminine, under the name of <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q> even the <q>virgin</q> is <em>bidden</em> to be veiled. Equally in each sex let the younger age follow the discipline of the elder; or else let the male <q><a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>,</q>  too, be <em>veiled</em>, if the female <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> withal are <em>not</em> veiled, because <em>they</em> are not mentioned by <em>name</em>. Let <q>man</q> and <q>youth</q> be different, if <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a></q> and <q>virgin</q> are different. For indeed it is <q>on account of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note038886"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:10</a></span> that he says <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> must be veiled, because on account of <q>the daughters of men</q> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> revolted from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  Who then, would contend that <q> <em><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a></em></q> <em>alone</em>&mdash; that is,  such as were already wedded and had lost their <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>&mdash; were the objects of angelic concupiscence, unless <q><a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a></q> are incapable of excelling in beauty and finding lovers? Nay, let us see whether it were not <em><a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> alone</em> whom they lusted after; since Scriptures says <q> <em>the daughters</em> of men;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038889"><a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;4:2</a></span> inasmuch as it might have named <q> <em>wives</em> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> or <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>,</q> indifferently.  Likewise, in that it says, <q>And they took them to themselves for wives,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038891"><a href="../bible/gen006.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;6:2</a></span> it does so on this ground, that, of course, such are <q>received <em>for wives</em></q> as are devoid of that title. But it would have expressed itself differently concerning such as were <em>not</em> thus devoid. And so (they who are named) are devoid as much of <em>widowhood</em> as of <em><a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a></em>. So completely has <em><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a></em> by naming the sex generally, mingled <q>daughters</q> and species together in the genus. Again, while he says that <q>nature herself,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038892"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:14</a></span> which has assigned hair as a tegument and ornament to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, <q>teaches that veiling is the duty of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>,</q> has not the same tegument and the same <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the head been assigned also to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>? If <q>it is shameful</q> for a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to be shorn it is similarly so to a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> too. From them, then, to whom is assigned one and the same <em>law</em> of the head,  one and the same <em>discipline</em>  of the head is exacted&mdash;(which extends) even unto those <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> whom their childhood defends,  for from the first  <em>a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a></em> was named <q>female.</q> This custom,  in short, even <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> observes; but if <em><a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></em> did <em>not</em> observe it, <em>our</em> Law,  amplified and supplemented, would vindicate the addition for itself; let it be excused for imposing the veil on <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> also. Under <em>our</em> dispensation, let that age which is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of its sex  retain the privilege of simplicity. For both Eve and Adam, when it befell them to be <q>wise,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038900"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;3:6</a></span> immediately veiled what they had learned to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.  At all events, with regard to those in whom girlhood has changed (into maturity), their age ought to remember its duties as to nature, so also, to discipline; for they are being transferred to the rank of <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a></q> both in their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and in their functions. No one is a <q>virgin</q> from the time when she is capable of marriage; seeing that, in her, age has by that time been wedded to its own husband, that is, to time.  <q>But some particular <em>virgin</em> has devoted herself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. From that very moment she both changes the fashion of her hair, and converts all her garb into that of a '<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.'</q> Let her, then, maintain the character wholly, and perform the whole function of a <q>virgin:</q> what she conceals  for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let her cover quite over.  It is our business to entrust to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God alone that which the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God effects in us, lest we receive from man the reward we hope for from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  Why do you denude before God  what you cover before men?  Will you be more modest in public than in the church? If <em>your self-devotion</em> is a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and you have received it, <q>why do you boast,</q> says he, <q>as if you have not received it?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038908"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> Why, by your ostentation of yourself, do you judge others? Is it that, by your boasting, you invite others unto good? Nay, but even you yourself run the risk of losing, if you boast; and you drive others unto the same perils! What is assumed from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of boasting is easily destroyed. Be veiled, virgin, if virgin you are; for you ought to blush. If you are a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, shrink from (the gaze of) many eyes. Let no one wonder at your face; let no one perceive your <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>.  You do well in <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> assuming the married character, if you veil your head; nay, you do not seem to assume it <em><a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a></em>, for you <em>are</em> wedded to Christ: to Him you have surrendered your body; act as becomes your Husband's discipline. If He bids the brides of others to be veiled, His own, of course, much more. <q>But each individual man  is not to think that the institution of his predecessor is to be overturned.</q> Many yield up their own judgment, and its consistency, to the custom of others. Granted that <em><a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a></em> be not <em>compelled</em> to be veiled, at all events such as <em>voluntarily are</em> so should not be prohibited; who, likewise, cannot deny themselves to be <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>,  content, in the security of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to damage their own fame.  Touching such, however, as are <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, I can with constancy <q>above my small measure</q>  pronounce and attest that they are to be veiled from that day forth on which they shuddered at the first bodily touch of a man by <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> and hand. For in them everything has been forewedded: their age, through maturity; their flesh, through age; their spirit, through consciousness; their modesty, through the experience of the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> their hope, through expectation; their mind through volition. And Rebecca is example enough for us, who, when her <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> had been pointed out, veiled herself for marriage merely on recognition of him. <span class="stiki" id="note038914"><a href="../bible/gen024.htm#verse64">Genesis&nbsp;24:64-65</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 23. Of Kneeling</h2>

<p>In the matter of <em>kneeling</em> also <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is subject to diversity of observance, through the act of some few who abstain from kneeling on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>; and since this dissension is particularly on its trial before the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, the Lord will give His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that the dissentients may either yield, or else indulge their opinion without offense to others. We, however (just as we have received), only on the day of the Lord's Resurrection ought to guard not only against kneeling, but every posture and office of solicitude; deferring even our businesses lest we give any place to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note038915"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse27">Ephesians&nbsp;4:27</a></span> Similarly, too, in the period of Pentecost; which period we distinguish by the same <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of exultation.  But who would hesitate <em>every</em> day to prostrate himself before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, at least in the first <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with which we enter on the daylight? At <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, moreover, and Stations, no <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should be made without kneeling, and the remaining customary marks of humility; for (then)  we are not only <em><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a></em>, but <em>deprecating</em>, and making satisfaction to God our Lord.  Touching <em>times</em> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> nothing at all has been prescribed, except clearly <q>to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> at every time and every place.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 24. Of Place for Prayer</h2>

<p>But how <q>in every place,</q> since we are prohibited  (from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>) in public? In every place, he means, which opportunity or even necessity, may have rendered suitable: for that which was done by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>  (who, in jail, in the audience of the prisoners, <q>began <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and singing to God</q>) is not considered to have been done contrary to the precept; nor yet that which was done by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>,  who in the ship, in presence of all, <q>made thanksgiving to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 25. Of Time for Prayer</h2>

<p>Touching the <em>time</em>, however, the extrinsic  observance of certain hours will not be unprofitable&mdash; those common hours, I mean, which mark the intervals of the day&mdash; the third, the sixth, the ninth&mdash; which we may find in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> to have been more solemn than the rest. The first infusion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> into the congregated <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> took place at <q>the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>.</q>  Peter, on the day on which he experienced the vision of Universal Community,  (exhibited) in that small vessel,  had ascended into the more lofty parts <em>of the house</em>, for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer's</a> sake <q>at the sixth hour.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038928"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse9">Acts&nbsp;10:9</a></span> The same (apostle) was going into the temple, with John, <q>at the ninth <em>hour</em>,</q>  when he restored the paralytic to his health. Albeit these <em>practices</em> stand simply without any <em>precept</em> for their observance, still it may be granted a good thing to establish some definite presumption, which may both add stringency to the admonition to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and may, as it were by a law, tear us out from our businesses unto such a duty; so that&mdash; what we read to have been observed by Daniel also,  in accordance (of course) with <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel's</a> discipline&mdash; we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> at least not less than thrice in the day, debtors as we are to Three&mdash; Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>: of course, in addition to our regular <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which are due, without any admonition, on the entrance of light and of night. But, withal, it becomes <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> not to take food, and not to go to the bath, before interposing a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; for the refreshments and nourishments of the spirit are to be held prior to those of the flesh, and things heavenly prior to things earthly.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26. Of the Parting of Brethren</h2>

<p>You will not dismiss a brother who has entered your house without <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.&mdash; <q>Have you seen,</q> says <em>Scripture</em>, <q>a brother? You have seen your Lord;</q> &mdash; especially <q>a stranger,</q> lest perhaps he be <q>an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.</q> But again, when received yourself by brethren, you will not make  earthly refreshments prior to heavenly, for your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will immediately be judged. Or else how will you&mdash; according to the precept <span class="stiki" id="note038933"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;10:5</a></span> &mdash; say, <q>Peace to this <em>house</em>,</q> unless you exchange mutual peace with them who are <em>in</em> the house?</p>

<h2>Chapter 27. Of Subjoining a Psalm</h2>

<p>The more diligent in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> are wont to subjoin in their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> the <q>Hallelujah,</q>  and such kind of psalms, in the closes of which the company respond. And, of course, every institution is excellent which, for the extolling and honouring of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, aims unitedly to bring Him enriched <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> as a choice victim. </p>

<h2>Chapter 28. Of the Spiritual Victim, Which Prayer is</h2>

<p>For this is the spiritual victim <span class="stiki" id="note038936"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:5</a></span> which has abolished the pristine <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. <q>To what purpose,</q> says He, <q>(do you bring) me the multitude of your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>? I am full of <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocausts</a> of rams, and I desire not the fat of rams, and the blood of bulls and of goats. For who has required these from your hands?</q>  What, then, God <em>has</em> required the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> teaches. <q>An hour will come,</q> says He, <q>when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For God is a Spirit, and accordingly requires His adorers to be such.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038938"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;4:23-24</a></span> We are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> adorers and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>,  who, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in spirit,  <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, in spirit, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>&mdash;a victim proper and acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which assuredly He has required, which He has looked forward to  for Himself! This <em>victim</em>, devoted from the whole heart, fed on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, tended by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, entire in innocence, pure in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, garlanded with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,  we ought to escort with the pomp  of good works, amid psalms and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, unto God's altar,  to obtain for us all things from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29. Of the Power of Prayer</h2>

<p>For what has <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who exacts it <em>ever</em> denied  to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> coming from <q>spirit and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?</q> How mighty specimens of its efficacy do we read, and hear, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>! <em>Old-world</em> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, indeed, used to free from fires, <span class="stiki" id="note038946"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm">Daniel 3</a></span> and from beasts, <span class="stiki" id="note038947"><a href="../bible/dan006.htm">Daniel&nbsp;6</a></span> and from famine;  and yet it had not (then) received its form from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But how far more amply operative is <em><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a></em> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>! It does not station the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of dew in mid-fires,  nor muzzle lions, nor transfer to the hungry the rustics' bread; <span class="stiki" id="note038950"><a href="../bible/2ki004.htm#verse42">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;4:42-44</a></span> it has no delegated <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to avert any sense of suffering;  but it supplies the suffering, and the feeling, and the grieving, with endurance: it amplifies <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what she obtains from the Lord, understanding what&mdash; for God's name's sake&mdash; she suffers. But in days gone by, withal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> used to call down  plagues, scatter the armies of foes, withhold the wholesome influences of the showers. Now, however, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of righteousness averts all God's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, keeps bivouac on behalf of personal enemies, makes supplication on behalf of persecutors. Is it wonder if <em>it</em> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to extort the <em>rains</em> of heaven &mdash; (<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>) which was <em>once</em> able to procure its <em>fires</em>?  Prayer is alone that which vanquishes  God. But Christ has willed that it be operative for no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: He had conferred on it all its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of good. And so it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing save how to recall the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed from the very path of death, to transform the weak, to restore the sick, to purge the possessed, to open prison-bars, to loose the bonds of the innocent. Likewise it washes away faults, repels <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, extinguishes <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, consoles the faint-spirited, cheers the high-spirited, escorts travellers, appeases waves, makes <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> stand aghast, nourishes the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, governs the rich, upraises the fallen, arrests the falling, confirms the standing. Prayer is the wall of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: her arms and missiles  against the foe who keeps watch over us on all sides. And, so never walk we unarmed. By day, be we mindful of Station; by night, of vigil. Under the arms of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> guard we the standard of our General; await we in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> trump.  The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, likewise, all <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; every creature <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>; cattle and wild beasts <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and bend their knees; and when they issue from their layers and lairs,  they look up heavenward with no idle mouth, making their breath vibrate  after their own manner. Nay, the birds too, rising out of the nest, upraise themselves heavenward, and, instead of hands, expand the cross of their wings, and say somewhat to seem like <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.  What more then, touching the office of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>? Even the Lord Himself <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>; to whom be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> unto the ages of the ages!</p>
