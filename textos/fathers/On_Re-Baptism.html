<h1>On Re-Baptism</h1>

<p><span class="sc">Argument.&mdash; That They Who Have Once Been Washed in the Name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, Ought Not to Be Re-Baptized.</span> </p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">I Observe</span> that it has been asked among the brethren what course ought specially to be adopted towards the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of those who, although <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, have yet been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>,  and subsequently departing from their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and fleeing as supplicants to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, should repent with their whole hearts, and only now perceiving the condemnation of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, implore from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the help of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. <em>The point is</em> whether, according to the most ancient custom and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a>, it would suffice, after that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which they have received outside <em>the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a></em> indeed, but still in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, that only hands should be laid upon them by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for their reception of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and this imposition of hands would afford them the renewed and perfected seal of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; or whether, indeed, a repetition of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> would be necessary for them, as if they should receive nothing if they had not obtained <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> afresh, just as if they were never <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. And therefore some things were talked about as having been written and replied on this new question, wherein both sides endeavoured with the greatest eagerness to demolish what had been written by their antagonists. In which kind of debate, as it appears to me, no controversy or discussion could have arisen at all if each one of us had been content with the venerable authority of all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>,  and with becoming humility had desired to innovate nothing, as observing no kind of room for contradiction. For everything which is both doubtful and ambiguous, and is established in opinions differing <em>among those</em> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> and faithful men, if it is judged to be against the ancient and memorable and most solemn observance of all those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and faithful men who have deserved well, ought assuredly to be condemned; since in a matter once arranged and ordained, whatever that is which is brought forward against the quiet and peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, will result in nothing but discords, and strifes, and schisms. And in this no other fruit can be found but this alone; that one man, whoever he is, should be vain-<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> declared among certain fickle men to be of great <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and constancy: and, being gifted with the arrogance of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, whose only consolation in destruction is the not appearing to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone, should be renowned among those that are most similar and agreeable to himself, as having corrected the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of all the churches. For this is the desire and purpose of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, to frame as many <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of this kind as possible against our most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to deem it a great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to have discovered anything that can be imputed to her as a crime, or even as a folly. And since it becomes no faithful man of sound mind to dare to hold such a view, especially no one who is ordained in any clerical office at all, and much more in the episcopal order, it is like a prodigy for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> themselves to devise such scandals, and not to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to unfold too irreverently against the precept of the law and of all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, with their own disgrace and risk, the disgrace of their mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>&mdash; if they think that there is any disgrace in this matter; although the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has no disgrace in this instance, save in the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of such men as these themselves. Therefore it is the more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in men of this kind, if that which is blamed by them in the most ancient observance, as if it were not rightly done, is manifestly and forcibly shown as well to have been rightly observed by those who were before us, as to be rightly observed also by us; so that even if we should engage in the controversy with equal arguments on both sides, yet, since that which was innovated could not be established without dissension among the brethren and mischief to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, assuredly it ought not&mdash;right or wrong, as they say, that is, contrary to what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and proper&mdash; rashly to be flung like a stain upon our mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and the ignominy of this audacity and impiety ought with reason to be attached to those who should attempt this. But since it is not in our power, according to the apostle's precept, <q>to speak the same thing, that there be not schisms among us; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note055372"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:10</a></span> yet, as far as we can, we strive to demonstrate the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> condition of this argument, and to persuade turbulent men, even now, to mind their own business, as we shall even attain a great deal if they will at length acquiesce in this sound advice.  And therefore we shall, as is needful, collect into one mass whatever passages of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> are pertinent to this subject. And we shall manifestly harmonize, as far as possible, those which seem to be differing or of various meaning; and we shall to the extent of our poor ability examine both the utility and advantage of each method, that we may recommend to all the brethren, that the most wholesome form and peaceful custom be adopted in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>2. To such, then, as approach to a discussion of saving and modern, that is, of spiritual and evangelical <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, there occurs first of all the announcement universally well known, made and begun by John the Baptist, who, somewhat departing from the law, that is, from the most ancient <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and preparing the way of the new and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, both preoccupied the ears of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> gradually by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of water and of repentance which for the time he practised, and took possession of them with the announcement of a spiritual <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> that was to come, exhorting them, and saying, <q>He that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose: He shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and with fire; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note055374"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;3:11</a></span> and for this reason we also ought to make a beginning of this discourse from this point. For in the Acts of the Apostles, the Lord after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, confirming this same word of John, <q>commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for that promise of the Father which, <em>says He</em>, you have heard from me; for John <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water, but you shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> not many days hence.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055375"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;1:4-5</a></span> And Peter also related these same words of the Lord, when he gave an account of himself to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, saying: <q>And as I began to speak, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> fell upon them as on us at the beginning; and I remembered the word of the Lord, how that He said, John indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water, but you shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. If, therefore, He gave them a like gift as to us, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who was I, that I could withstand the Lord? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note055376"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;11:15-17</a></span> And again: <q>Men and brethren, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how from ancient days God made choice among us, that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> by my mouth should hear the word of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the hearts, bare them <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, giving them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, even as He did unto us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055377"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse7">Acts&nbsp;15:7-8</a></span> And on this account we ought to consider what is the force and power of this saying. For the Lord says to them who would have to be subsequently <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> because they should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that they must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> not in like manner as by Him in water, unto repentance, but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And of this announcement, as assuredly none of us can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it, it is plain on what principle men were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For it was peculiarly in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> Himself alone that they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For John distinguished, and said that he indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in water, but that one should come who would <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and they are so by the <em>Spirit's</em> bestowal and operation of hidden results. Moreover, they are so no less in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the Spirit and of water. They are so, besides, also in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of every one in his own proper blood  Even as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> declare to us, from which we shall adduce evident <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> throughout each individual instance of those things which we shall narrate.</p>

<p>3. And to these things you perchance, who art bringing in some novelty, may immediately and impatiently reply, as you are wont, that the Lord said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Unless a man be born again of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q>  Whence it manifestly appears that that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> alone is profitable wherein also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> can dwell; for that upon the Lord Himself, when He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> descended, and that His deed and word are quite in harmony, and that such a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> can consist with no other principle. To which reply none of us is found either so senseless or so stubborn as to dare, contrary to right or contrary to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to object, for instance, so to the doing of things in their integrity, and by all means in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the observation of them according to the order of discipline perpetually by us. But if, in the same <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, those things which in that matter we come upon as associated, be sometimes found in some sort divided, and separated, and arranged, and ordered just as if they were by themselves; let us see whether these solitary instances by themselves may not sometimes be such as are not imperfect, but, as it were, entire and complete. For when by imposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is given to every one that believes, as in the case of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, after Philip's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> did to them by <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a>; in this manner also they conferred on them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. And that this might be the case, they themselves <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them, for as yet the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> had not descended upon any of them, but they had only been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>. Moreover, our Lord after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, when He had breathed upon His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and had said to them, <q>Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055380"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John 20:22</a></span> thus and thus only bestowed upon them the Spirit.</p>

<p>4. And this being found to be so, what do you think, my brother? If a man be not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, so as even at once to have the imposition of hands, and should yet die before having received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, should you judge him to have received <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> or not? Because, indeed, both the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> others, and were themselves <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the Lord, did not at once receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, for He had not as yet been given, because that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had not as yet been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. And after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> no small interval of time elapsed before that took place&mdash;even as also the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, when they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Philip, <em>did not receive the gift</em> until the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> invited from Jerusalem to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> went down to them to lay hands upon them, and conferred on them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> by the imposition of hands. Because in that interval of time any one of them who had not attained the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, might have been cut off by death, and die defrauded of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. And it cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> also, that in the present day this sort of thing is usual, and happens frequently, that many after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> depart from this life without imposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands, and yet are esteemed perfected <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. Just as the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a> eunuch, when he was returning from Jerusalem and reading the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah, and was in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, having at the Spirit's suggestion heard the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from Philip the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and when he had gone up out of the water, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> took away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more. For he went on his way rejoicing, although, as you observe, hands were not <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laid on him</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, that he might receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But if you admit this, and believe it to be saving, and do not gainsay the opinion of all the faithful, you must needs confess this, that even as this principle proceeds to be more largely discussed, that other also can be more broadly established; that is, that by the imposition of hands alone of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>&mdash; because <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> has gone before it&mdash; may the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also be given to another man who repents and believes. Because the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> has affirmed that they who should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, must needs be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; so that these also may not seem to have anything less than those who are perfectly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; lest it should be needful to ask what sort of a thing was that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which they have attained in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Unless, perchance, in that former discussion also, about those who should only have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, you should decide that they can be saved even without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, or that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not accustomed to be bestowed in this manner only, but by the imposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands; or even should say that it is not the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> alone who can bestow the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>5. And if this be so, and the occurrence of any of these things cannot deprive a man who believes, of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, you yourself also affirmest that the fact of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> being divided in a manner, and its not being, as you contend, consummated, where necessity intervenes, cannot take away <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from a believing and penitent man. Or if you say that a man of this kind cannot be saved, we deprive all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, whom you thus engage, under risks as assured as possible, to be bound themselves to afford help to all those who live under their care, and are in weak health, in their districts, scattered up and down, because other men of less degree among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who venture cannot confer the same benefit; so that the blood of those who shall appear to have departed from this life without the benefit would have, of necessity, to be required at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. And further, as you are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is found to have been given to men who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, by the Lord without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of water, as is contained in the Acts of the Apostles after this manner: <q>While Peter was still speaking these words, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> fell upon all them who heard the word. And they who were of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also was poured out the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For they heard them speak with their tongues, and they magnified God. Then answered Peter, Can any man forbid water, that these should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, who have received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as well as we? And he commanded them to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055381"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse44">Acts 10:44-48</a></span> Even as Peter also subsequently most abundantly taught us about the same <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, saying: <q>And He put no difference between us and them, their hearts being purified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055382"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse9">Acts 15:9</a></span> And there will be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that men may be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> without water&mdash;as you observe that these were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> before they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water; that the announcements of both John and of our Lord Himself were satisfied&mdash;forasmuch as they received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the promise both without the imposition of the apostle's hands and without the laver, which they attained afterwards. And their hearts being purified, God bestowed upon them at the same time, in virtue of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; so that the subsequent <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> conferred upon them this benefit alone, that they received also the invocation of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, that nothing might appear to be wanting to the integrity of their service and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. </p>

<p>6. And this also&mdash;looking at it from the opposite side of this discussion&mdash;those <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of our Lord themselves attained, upon whom, being previously <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> at length came down on the day of Pentecost, descending from heaven indeed by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not of His own accord, but effused for this very office, and moreover upon each one of them. Although these were already righteous, and, as we have said, had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the Lord's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> even as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves, who nevertheless are found on the night on which He was apprehended to have all deserted Him. And even Peter himself, who boasted that he would persevere in his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and most obstinately resisted the prediction of the Lord Himself, yet at last denied Him, that by this means it might be shown to us, that whatever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they bad contracted in the meantime and in any manner, these same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in them subsequently attested as sincere, were without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> put away by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Nor, as I think, was it for any other reason that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had charged those whom they addressed in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, that they should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of Christ Jesus, except that the power of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> invoked upon any man by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> might afford to him who should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> no slight advantage for the attainment of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as Peter relates in the Acts of the Apostles, saying: <q>For there is none other name under heaven given among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> whereby we must be saved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055384"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse12">Acts 4:12</a></span> As also the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> unfolds, showing that God has exalted our Lord Jesus, and <q>given Him a name, that it may be above every name, that in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> all should bow the knee, of things heavenly and earthly, and under the earth, and every. tongue should confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father.</q> And he on whom, when he should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, invocation should be made in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, although he might obtain <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> under some <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, still would not be hindered from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> at some time or another, and correcting his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and sincerely confessing our Jesus before men; so that then, when hands were laid upon him by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he might also receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and he would not lose that former invocation of the name of Jesus. Which none of us may disallow, although this invocation, if it be standing bare and by itself, could not suffice for affording <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, lest on this principle we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that even <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who abuse the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, could attain unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> without the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and entire thing. Yet it is extremely useful to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that this invocation of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, together with the correction of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and the acknowledgment of the belief of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and with the putting away of all stain of past conversation, if rightly performed with the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of God among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of this kind, obtains a place which it would not have had, and finally, in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and for the maintenance of the integrity of the sign, is no hindrance, when its supplement which had been wanting is added; and that it is consistent with good reason, with the authority of so many years, and so many churches and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; even as it is the very greatest disadvantage and damage to our most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother Church, now for the first time suddenly and without reason to rebel against former decisions after so long a series of so many ages. For not for any other reason Peter&mdash; who had already been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and had been asked what he thought of the Lord by the Lord Himself, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the revelation of the Father in heaven being bestowed on him bad confessed that Christ was not only our Lord, but was the Son of the living God&mdash; was shown subsequently to have withstood the same Christ when He made announcement of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, and therefore was set forth as being called <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. <em>For no other reason</em> except because it would come to pass that some, although varying in their own judgment, and somewhat halting in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and doctrine, although they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, yet, if they had been able to rescind their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in some interval of time, were not on that account cut off from <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; but at any time that they had come to the right <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, obtained by repentance a sound hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, especially when they received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Whom is the duty of every man, they would have intended some such thing. Even as we do not apprehend that Peter in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> suffered this alone, but all the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, to whom, though already <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the Lord afterwards says, that <q>all you shall be offended in me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055385"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse27">Mark 14:27</a></span> all of whom, as we observe, having amended their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> after the Lord's resurrection with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. So that not without reason we also in the present day may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that men, amended from their former <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, may be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who, although they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water in the name of the Lord, might have had a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> somewhat imperfect. Because it is of great importance whether a man is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at all in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, or indeed whether in some respect he halts when he is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of water, which is of less account provided that afterwards a sincere <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is evident in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which undoubtedly is of greater account.</p>

<p>7. Neither must you esteem what our Lord said as being contrary to this treatment: <q>Go, teach the nations; <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055386"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a></span> Because, although this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and right, and to be observed by all means in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and moreover has been used to be observed, yet it behooves us to consider that invocation of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> ought not to be thought futile by us on account of the veneration and power of that very name, in which name all kinds of power are accustomed to be exercised, and occasionally some even by men outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But to what effect are those words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who said that He would deny, and not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, those who should say to Him in the day of judgment, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, and in Your name cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and in Your name done many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a>, when He answered them, even with emphasis,  <q>I never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you; depart from me, you who work iniquity,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055388"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse27">Mark 14:27</a></span> unless that it should be shown to us, that even by those who work iniquity might these good works also be done, by the superfluous  energy of the name of Christ? Therefore ought this invocation of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to be received as a certain beginning of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Lord common to us and to all others, which may afterwards be filled up with the remaining things. Otherwise such an invocation would not avail if it should remain alone, because after the death of a man in this position there cannot be added to him anything at all, nor supplemented, nor can, in anything, avail him in the day of judgment, when they shall begin to be reproached by our Lord with those things which we have above mentioned, none of whom notwithstanding in this present time may by any man be so hardly and cruelly prohibited from aiding themselves in those ways which we have above shown.</p>

<p>8. But these things you will, as you are wont. contradict, by objecting to us, that when they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> perfectly, and rightly, and not as these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; and this you must needs assume from their condition, and His who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> them. And therefore we reply to this proposition of yours, not as accusers of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, but as we are constrained, because it is necessary that we should investigate by reasons where and when, and in what measure, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> has been bestowed on each of us. For that our Lord was born, and that He was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, appeared by many reasons to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, not <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, by His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, because He had been born of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David, and in the city of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>; and because He had been announced to the shepherds by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> at the same moment that there was born to them a Saviour; because His star being seen in the east, He had been most anxiously sought for and adored by the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, and honoured with illustrious presents and distinguished offerings; because while still a youth, sitting in the temple with the doctors of the law, He wisely, and with the admiration of all, had disputed; because when He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> He had been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, as had happened to none others, by the descent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from the opened heavens, and by its abode upon Him; and moreover by the testimony of His Father, and also of John the Baptist; because, beyond the inferior capacity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He understood the hearts and thoughts of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; because He cured and healed weaknesses, and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and diseases, with very great power; because He bestowed remissions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, with manifest attestation; because He expelled <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> at His bidding; because He purified <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> with a word; because, by converting water into wine, He enlarged the nuptial festivity with marvellous joyfulness; because He restored or granted sight to the blind; because He maintained the doctrine of the Father with all confidence; because in a desert place He satisfied five thousand men with five loaves; because the remains and the fragments filled more than twelve baskets; because He everywhere raised up the dead, according to His mercy; because He commanded the winds and the sea to be still; because He walked with His feet upon the sea; because He absolutely performed all <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.</p>

<p>9. By which things, and by many <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of this kind tending to His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, it appeared to follow as a consequence, that in whatever manner the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> think about Christ, and although they do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, that even they themselves thought that such and so great a one would without any death endure to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and would possess the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and of the whole world for ever; and that it should not be destroyed. Whence, moreover, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> dared to seize Him by force, and anoint Him for the kingdom, which indeed He was compelled to evade; and therefore His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> thought that in no other way would He bestow upon them <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, except He Himself had first continued this temporal life into that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> one in His own experience. In fine, when they were passing through <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, Jesus said to them, <q>The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is to be delivered into the hands of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and they will kill Him; and after three days He shall rise again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055390"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse30">Mark 9:30</a></span> and they were greatly grieved, because, as we have said, they had formed a very different notion previously in their minds and hearts. And again, this also was the speech of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, in contradiction against Him, when He taught them of Himself, and announced future things to them, and they said, <q>We have heard out of the law that Christ abides for ever: and how do you say that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> must be lifted up? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note055391"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse34">John 12:34</a></span> And so there was this same presumption concerning Christ in the mind of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, even as Peter himself, the leader and chief of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, broke forth into that expression of his own incredulity. For when he, together with the others, had been asked by the Lord what he thought about Him, that is, whom he thought Him to be, and had first of all confessed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, saying that He was the Christ the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore was judged blessed by Him because he had arrived at this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not after the flesh, but by the revelation of the heavenly Father; yet this same Peter, when Jesus began to show His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, and be killed, and after the third day rise again from the dead; nevertheless that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> confessor of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, after a few days, taking Him aside, began to rebuke Him, saying, <q>Be propitious to Yourself: this shall not be; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note055392"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse22">Matthew 16:22</a></span> so that on that account he deserved to hear from the Lord, <q>Get behind me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>;  you are an offense unto me, because he savoured not the things which are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but those things which are of men.</q> Which rebuke against Peter became more and more apparent when the Lord was apprehended, and, frightened by the damsel, he said, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what you say, neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I you; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note055394"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse70">Matthew 26:70</a></span> and again when, using an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, he said this same thing; and for the third time, cursing and swearing, he affirmed that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the man, and not once, but frequently, denied Him.  And this disposition, because it was to continue to him even to the Lord's passion, was long before made manifest by the Lord, that we also might not be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it. Again, after the Lord's resurrection, one of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, Cleopas, when he was, according to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of all his fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, sorrowfully telling what had happened to the Lord Himself, as if to some unknown person, spoke thus, saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the Nazarene, <q>who was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> mighty in deed and in word before God and all the people; how the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and fastened Him to the cross. But we trusted that it had been He which should have redeemed <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055396"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse20">Luke 24:20-21</a></span> And in addition to these things, all the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> also judged the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who had seen the Lord after the resurrection to be idle tales; and some of themselves, when they had seen Him, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not, but <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>; and they who were not then present <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not at all until they had been subsequently by the Lord Himself in all ways rebuked and reproached; because His death had so offended them that they thought that He had not risen again, who they had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> ought not to have died, because contrary to their belief He had died once. And thus, as far as concerns the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> themselves, they are found to have had a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> neither sound nor perfect in such matters as we have referred to; and what is much more serious, they moreover <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> others, as it is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John.</p>

<p>10. Besides, what will you say of those who are in many cases <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of very bad character, who yet at length, when God so wills it, convicted of their crimes, are even deprived of their office itself, or absolutely of communion? Or what will you decide of those who may have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, whose opinions are unsound, or who are very <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>&mdash; when they may not have spoken clearly and honestly, or even have spoken otherwise than is fit in the tradition of the sacrament, or at least may have asked anything, or asking, have heard from those who answered what ought by no means to be so asked or answered? And still this does not greatly injure that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of ours, although, moreover, these more simple men may deliver the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without the elegance and order that you would use. And you will assuredly say, with that marvellous carefulness of yours, that these too should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, since this is especially the thing which is wanting to them, or hinders their being able to receive, uncorrupted, that divine and inviolable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And yet, O excellent man, let us attribute and allow to the heavenly agencies their power, and let us concede to the condescension of the divine majesty its appropriate operations; and understanding how great is the advantage therein, let us gladly acquiesce in it. And thus, as our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is founded in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which for the most part is associated with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of water, if indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> shall be given by us, let it be conferred in its integrity and with <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, and with all those meanswhich are written; and let it be administered without any disconnection of anything. Or if, by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the case, it should be administered by an inferior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, let us wait for the result, that it may either be supplied by us,  or reserved to be supplied by the Lord. If, however, it should have been administered by strangers, let this matter be amended as it can and as it allows. Because outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> moreover cannot exist, not alone among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but even among those who are established in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. And for that reason, they who repent and are amended by the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and by their own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which subsequently has been improved by the purification of their heart, ought to be aided only by spiritual <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, that is, by the imposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands, and by the ministration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Moreover, the perfect seal of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has been rightly accustomed to be given in this manner and on this principle in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. So that the invocation of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, which cannot be done away, may not seem to be held in disesteem by us; which assuredly is not fitting; although such an invocation, if none of those things of which we have spoken should follow it, may fail and be deprived of the effect of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For when the apostle said that there was <q>one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055398"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians 4:5</a></span> it must needs have been by the continued effect of the invocation of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, because, once invoked, it cannot be taken away by any man, even although we might venture, against the decision of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, to repeat it by giving too much, yea, by the desire of superadding <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. If he who returns to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be unwilling again to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the result will be that we may defraud him of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, whom we think we must not defraud of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of water.</p>

<p>11. And what will you determine against the person of him who hears the word,  and haply taken up in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, has at once confessed, and has been punished before it has been granted him to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water? Will you declare him to have perished because he has not been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water? Or, indeed, will you think that there may be something from without that helps him to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, although he is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water? Your thinking him to have perished will be opposed by the sentence of the Lord, who says, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father which is in heaven;  <span class="stiki" id="note055400"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse32">Matthew 10:32</a></span> because it is no matter whether he who confesses for the Lord is a hearer of the word or a believer, so long as he confesses that same Christ whom he ought to confess; because the Lord, by confessing him, in turn Himself graces His confessor before his Father with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, as He promised. But this assuredly ought not to be taken too liberally, as if it could be stretched to such a point as that any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> can confess the name of Christ who notwithstanding denies Christ Himself; that he believes on another Christ, when Christ avows that it cannot avail him at all; forasmuch as the Lord said that He  must needs be brought to confession by us before men, which cannot be done without Him, and without veneration of His name. And therefore both  ought to stand by the confessor, sound, and sincere, and uncontaminated, and inviolated, without any choice being made of the confessor himself, whether he is righteous or a sinner, and a perfect <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> or an imperfect one, who has not feared to confess the Lord at his own greatest peril. And this is not contrary to the former discussion, because there is left therein time for the correction of many things which are bad, and because certain things are conceded to the very name only of our Lord; while <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> cannot be consummated except in the Lord and by the Lord Himself, and therefore nobody can confess Christ without His name, nor can the name of Christ avail any one for confession without Christ Himself.</p>

<p>12. Wherefore the whole of this discussion must be considered, that it may be made clearer. For the invocation of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> can only be an advantage if it shall be subsequently properly supplemented, because both <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> have so declared. For James says in the Acts of the Apostles: <q>Men and brethren, hearken: Simon has declared how God at the first visited the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, to take out of them a people for His name. And to this agree the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; as it is written, After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will raise it up anew; that the residue of men may seek the Lord, and all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, upon whom my name is called upon them, says the Lord, who does these things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055403"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse13">Acts 15:13-17</a></span> Therefore also the residue of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that is, some of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> upon whom the name of the Lord is called, may and of necessity must seek the Lord, because that very invocation of the name affords them the opportunity, or even imposes on them the necessity, of seeking the Lord. And with these they prescribe the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>&mdash; whether all or only some of them&mdash; to discuss still more boldly concerning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> than with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> upon whom the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has not been invoked, as it likewise has not upon the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who only receive the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> Scriptures. And thus men of both of these kinds, that is, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, fully believing as they ought, are in like manner <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who are already <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in water in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> must only be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and in Jesus, which is <q>the only name given under heaven whereby we must be saved,</q> death is reasonably despised, although, if they continue as they are, they cannot be saved, because they have not sought the Lord after the invocation of His name upon them&mdash;even as those who, on account of false Christs, perchance have refused to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, of whom the Lord says, <q>Take heed that no man lead you into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall lead many into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</q>  And again He says: <q>Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo here is Christ, or lo there; <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, and shall show great signs and wonders; so that, if it were possible, even the very elect shall be deceived.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055405"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse23">Matthew 24:23-24</a></span> And these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, they shall then do under the name of Christ; in which name some even now appear to do certain <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and to prophesy <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>. But it is certain that those, because they are themselves not of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, therefore do not belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in like manner as if one should depart from Christ, abiding only in His name, he would not be much advantaged; nay, rather, he is even burdened by that name, although he may have been previously very faithful, or very righteous, or honoured with some clerical office, or endowed with the dignity of confession. For all those, by denying the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Christ, and by introducing or following another&mdash; although there is no other at all&mdash; leave themselves no hope or <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; not otherwise than they who have denied Christ before men, who must needs be denied by Christ; no consideration for them being made from their previous conversation, or feeling, or dignity, equally as they themselves have dared to do away with Christ, that is, their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, they are condemned by the short sentence of this kind, because it was manifestly said by the Lord, <q>Whosoever shall deny me before men, I also will deny him before my Father which is in heaven.</q> As this word <q>whosoever,</q> also in the sentence of confession, most fully shows us that no condition of the confessor himself can stand in the way, although he may have been before a denier, or a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, or a hearer, or one who is beginning to hear, who has not yet been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> or converted from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or one who has departed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and has afterwards returned, and then when he returned, before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands could be laid upon him, being apprehended, should be compelled to confess Christ before men; even as to one who again denies Christ, no special ancient dignity can be effectual to him for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>13. For any one of us will hold it necessary, that whatever is the last thing to be found in a man in this respect, is that whereby he must be judged, all those things which he has previously done being wiped away and obliterated.  And therefore, although in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> there is so great a change of things in a moment of time, that in a very rapid case all things may be changed; let nobody flatter himself who has lost the occasion of a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, if by chance he has excluded himself therefrom by his own fault; even as that wife of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>,  who in a similar manner in time of trouble only, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> command, looked behind her, and she became a pillar of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>. On which principle also, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> who, by confessing Christ's name, is <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, can subsequently correct nothing, if he should have thought anything erroneously of God or of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although by believing on another God or on another Christ he has deceived himself: he is not a confessor of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but in the name only of Christ; since also the apostle goes on to say, <q>And if I shall give up my body so that I may be burnt up with fire, but have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, I profit nothing.</q>  Because by this deed he profits nothing who has not the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of that God and Christ who is announced by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in this manner: <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with all your heart, and with all your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and with all your thought; and you shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself. For on these two commandments hang all the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note055409"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse37">Matthew 22:37</a></span> &mdash; even as John the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> said, <q>And every one that loves is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for God is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note055410"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse7">John 4:7-8</a></span> even as God also says, <q>For God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that every one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life,</q>  &mdash; as it manifestly appears that he who has not in him this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, of loving us and of being loved by us, profits nothing by an empty confession and passion, except that thereby it appears and is plain that he is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> who believes on another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or receives another Christ than Him whom the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> manifestly declare, which announce without any obscurity the Father <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, Creator of all things, and His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. For it shall happen to them as to one who expects <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from another God. Then, finally, contrary to their notion, they are condemned to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment by Christ, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> the Father <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, the Creator whom they have <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>, when God shall begin to judge the hidden things of men according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> by Christ Jesus, because they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, although they were washed in His name.</p>

<p>14. And even to this point the whole of that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> may be amended, after the intervention of some space of time, if a man should survive and amend his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Luke, spoke to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, saying, <q>But I have another <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055412"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse50">Luke 12:50</a></span> Also according to Mark He said, with the same purpose, to the sons of Zebedee: <q>Are you able to drink of the cup which I drink of, or to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> wherewith I am <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note055413"><a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse38">Mark 10:38</a></span> Because He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that those men had to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> not only with water, but also in their own blood; so that, as well <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in this <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> only, they might attain the sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the simple <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the laver, and, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in both ways, they might in like manner to the same extent attain the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For what was said by the Lord, <q>I have another <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with,</q> signifies in this place not a second <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as if there were two baptisms, but demonstrates that there is moreover a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of another kind given to us, concurring to the same <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And it was fitting that both these kinds should first of all be initiated and sanctified by our Lord Himself, so that either one of the two or both kinds might afford to us this one twofold saving and glorifying <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and certain ways of the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> might so be laid open to us, that at times some one of them might be wanting without mischief, even as in the case of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> that hear the word, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of water is wanting without <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and yet we are certain that these, if they had any indulgence, would also be used to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water. And also to those who are made lawful <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of their own blood is wanting without mischief, because, being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they have been redeemed with the most precious blood of the Lord; since both of these rivers of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the Lord proceed out of one and the same fountain, that every one who thirsts may come and drink, as says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>From his belly flowed rivers of living water; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note055414"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse38">John 7:38</a></span> which rivers were manifested first of all in the Lord's passion, when from His side, pierced by the soldier's spear, flowed blood and water, so that the one side of the same person emitted two rivers of a different kind, that whosoever should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and drink of both rivers might be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For, speaking of these rivers, the Lord set this forth, signifying the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> whom they should receive who should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him: <q>But the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055415"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse39">John 7:39</a></span> And when He thus said how <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> might be produced, which the apostle declares to be one, it is assuredly manifest on that principle that there are different kinds of one and the same <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> that flow from one wound into water and blood; since there are there two baptisms of water of which we have spoken, that is, of one and the same kind,  although the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of each kind ought to be one, as we have more fully spoken.</p>

<p>15. And since we seem to have divided all spiritual <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in a threefold manner, let us come also to the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the statement proposed, that we may not appear to have done this of our own judgment, and with rashness. For John says of our Lord in his epistle, teaching us: <q>This is He who came by water and blood, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; not by water only, but by water and blood: and it is the Spirit that bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, because the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For three bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and the water, and the blood: and these three are one; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note055417"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse6">1 John 5:6</a></span> &mdash; that we may gather from these words both that water is wont to confer <em>the Spirit</em>, and that men's own blood is wont to confer the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and that the Spirit Himself also is wont to confer the Spirit. For since water is poured forth even as blood, the Spirit also was poured out by the Lord upon all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Assuredly both in water, and none the less in their own blood, and then especially in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, men may be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For Peter says: But this is that which was spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; It shall come to pass in the last days, says the Lord, I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh: and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy, and their young men shall see visions, and their old men shall dream dreams: and upon my servants, and upon my handmaidens, will I pour out of my Spirit;  <span class="stiki" id="note055418"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse17">Acts 2:17-18</a></span> &mdash; which Spirit we discover to have been communicated in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, not indeed everywhere nor at large, but with other gifts; or, moreover, to have sprung of His own will into certain men, or to have invested them, or to have been upon them, even as we observe that it was said by the Lord to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, about the seventy elders, <q>And I will take of the Spirit which is upon you, and will put it upon them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055419"><a href="../bible/num011.htm#verse17">Numbers 11:17</a></span> For which reason also, according to His promise, God put upon them from another of the Spirit which had been upon <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and they prophesied in the camp. And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, as a spiritual man, rejoiced that this had so happened, although he was unwillingly persuaded by Jesus the son of Nave to oppose this thing, and was not thereby induced. Further, also in the book of Judges, and in the books of Kings too, we observe that upon several, there either was the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a>, or that He came unto them, as upon Gothoniel, Gideon, Jephthah, Samson, Saul, David, and many others. Which comes to this result, that the Lord has taught us most plainly by them the liberty and power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, approaching of His own will, saying, <q>The Spirit breathes where He will; and you hear His voice, and <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> not whence He comes or whither He goes.</q>  So that the same Spirit is, moreover, sometimes found to be upon those who are unworthy of Him; not certainly in vain or without reason, but for the sake of some needful operation; as He was upon Saul, upon whom came the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and he prophesied. However, in later days, after the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> departed from him, and after a malign spirit from the Lord vexed him, because then he had come, after the messengers whom he had previously sent before with care, with intent to kill David; and they therefore fell into the chorus of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and they prophesied, so that they neither were able nor willing to do what they had been bidden. And we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Spirit which was upon them all effected this with an admirable wisdom, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Which Spirit also filled John the Baptist even from his mother's womb; and it fell upon those who were with Cornelius the centurion before they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water. Thus, cleaving to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> either goes before or follows it; or failing the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of water, it falls upon those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. We are counselled that either we ought duly to maintain the integrity of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or if by chance <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is given by any one in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, we ought to supplement it, guarding the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> invocation of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, as we have most abundantly set forth; guarding, moreover, the custom and authority which so much claim our veneration for so long a time and for such great men.</p>

<p>16. But since the first part of this argument seems to be unfolded, we ought to touch on its subsequent part, on account of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; because it is very necessary not to pass over that discussion which once falls into our hands, lest perchance some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> should dare, of his subtlety, to assail those of our brethren who are more simple. For because John said that we must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and in fire, from the fact that he went on to say <em>and fire</em>, some desperate men have dared to such an extent to carry their depravity, and therefore very crafty men seek how they can thus corrupt and violate, and even neutralize the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Who derive the origin of their notion from <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>, practising it with manifold perversity through various <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>; to whom <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Simon Peter</a>, in the Acts of the Apostles, said, <q>Your money perish with you, because you have thought that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God could be possessed by money; you have neither part nor lot in this work; for your heart is not right with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055421"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse20">Acts 8:20-21</a></span> And such men as these do all these things in the desire to deceive those who are more simple or more inquisitive. And some of them try to argue that they only administer a sound and perfect, not as we, a mutilated and curtailed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which they are in such wise said to designate, that immediately they have descended into the water, fire at once appears upon the water. Which if it can be effected by any trick, as several tricks of this kind are affirmed to be&mdash; of Anaxilaus&mdash; whether it is anything natural, by means of which this may happen, or whether they think that they behold this, or whether the work and magical poison of some malignant being can force fire from the water; still they declare such a deceit and artifice to be a perfect <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which if faithful men have been forced to receive, there will assuredly be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that they have lost that which they had. Just as, if a soldier after taking an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> should desert his camp, and in the very different camp of the enemy should wish to take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of a far other kind, it is plain that in this way he is discharged from his old <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.</p>

<p>17. Moreover, if a man of this sort should again return to you, you will assuredly hesitate whether he may have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> or no; and yet it will behoove you, in whatever way you can, to aid even this man if he repent. For of this adulterous, yea, murderous <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, if there is any other author, it is then certainly a book devised by these same <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> on behalf of this same <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, which is inscribed <em>The Preaching of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a></em>;  in which book, contrary to all Scriptures, you will find both Christ confessing His own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash; although He alone did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all&mdash; and almost compelled by His mother Mary unwillingly to receive John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Also, that when He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, fire was seen to be upon the water, which is written in neither of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. And that after such long time, Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, after the collation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in Jerusalem, and the mutual consideration and altercation and arrangement of things to be done finally, were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to one another, as if then for the first time; and certain other things devised of this kind disgracefully and absurdly;&mdash; all which things you will find gathered together into that book. But they who are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, understand that what is said of fire is said of the Spirit Himself. For in the Acts of the Apostles, according to thatsame promise of our Lord, on the very day of Pentecost, when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> had descended upon the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that they might be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in Him, there were seen sitting upon each one tongues as if of fire, that it might be manifest that they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and with fire&mdash; that is, with that Spirit which was, whether fire, or as fire, such as was the fire which burned in the bush, and did not consume the bush; and such as is that fire which is the Spirit of the Angel, as says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, Who makes His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> spirits, and His ministers a burning fire;   whom if you should resemble, or be a companion or sharer with, you shall be able to dread no fire, not even that which, going before the Lord in the day of judgment, shall burn up the whole world, save those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and in fire.</p>

<p>18. And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, indeed, continues to this day invisible to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as the Lord says, <q>The Spirit breathes where He will; and you know not whence He comes, or whither He goes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055424"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse8">John 3:8</a></span> But in the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and of spiritual <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the same Spirit was manifestly seen to have sat upon the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> as it had been fire. Moreover, the heavens being opened, to have descended upon the Lord like a dove; because many things, yea, almost all things which were to be, are manifest&mdash; which, however, were only invisible nevertheless&mdash;now also are shown to the eyes and to the incredulity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, either partially, or at times, or in figure, for the strengthening and confirming of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But neither should I omit that which the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> well announces. For our Lord says to the paralytic man, <q>Be of good cheer, my son, your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055425"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse2">Matthew 9:2</a></span> that He might show that hearts were purified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that should follow. And this remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> also which was a sinner in the city obtained, to whom the Lord said, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you.</q>  And when they who were reclining around began to say among themselves, Who is this that forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>?  <span class="stiki" id="note055427"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse50">Luke 7:50</a></span> &mdash; because concerning the paralytic the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> had murmured crossly&mdash; the Lord says to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has made you whole; go in peace.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055428"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse50">Luke 7:50</a></span> From all which things it is shown that hearts are purified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are washed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; further, also, that bodies are washed by water, and moreover that by blood we may more readily attain at once to the rewards of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>19. I think that we have fully followed out the announcement of John the Baptist, whence we began our discourse, when he said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>I indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with water unto repentance; but He who comes after me is greater than I, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose: He shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and with fire.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055429"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse16">Luke 3:16</a></span> Moreover, I think also that we have not unsuitably set in order the teaching of the Apostle John, who says that <q>three bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and the water, and the blood; and these three are one.</q>  And, unless I am mistaken, we have also explained what our Lord says: <q>John indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water, but you shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note055431"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse5">Acts 1:5</a></span> Moreover, I think that we have given no weak reason as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the custom. Let us have a care, although we do that in a subsequent place, that none may think that we are stirring up the present debate on a single article; although this custom even alone ought, among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who have the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are lowly, to maintain a chief place.</p>
