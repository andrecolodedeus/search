<h1>On Repentance</h1>


<h2>Chapter 1. Of Heathen Repentance</h2>

<p>Repentance, men understand, so far as nature is able, to be an emotion of the mind arising from disgust  at some <em>previously cherished</em> worse sentiment: that kind of men <em>I mean</em> which even we ourselves were in days gone by&mdash; blind, without the Lord's light. From the <em>reason</em> of repentance, however, they are just as far as they are from the Author of reason Himself. <em>Reason</em>, in fact, is a thing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as there is nothing which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Maker of all has not provided, disposed, ordained <em>by reason</em>&mdash; nothing which He has not willed should be handled and understood <em>by reason</em>. All, therefore, who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must necessarily be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> also of a thing which is His, because no treasure-house  at all is accessible to strangers. And thus, voyaging all the universal course of life without the rudder of reason, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to shun the hurricane which is impending over the world.  Moreover, how irrationally they behave in the practice of repentance, it will be enough briefly to show just by this one fact, that they exercise it even in the case of their <em>good</em> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. They repent of good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, of simple-heartedness, of patience, of mercy, just in proportion as any deed <em>prompted by these feelings</em> has fallen on thankless soil. They execrate their own selves for having done good; and that species chiefly of repentance which is applied to the best works they fix in their heart, making it their care to remember never again to do a good turn. On repentance for <em><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></em> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, on the contrary, they lay lighter stress. In short, they make this same (<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>) a means of <em>sinning</em> more readily than a means of <em>right-doing</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. True Repentance a Thing Divine, Originated by God, and Subject to His Laws</h2>

<p>But if they acted as men who had any part in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thereby in reason also, they would first weigh well the importance of repentance, and would never apply it in such a way as to make it a ground for <em>convicting themselves of</em> perverse self-amendment. In short, they would regulate the limit of their repentance, because they would reach (a limit) in sinning too&mdash; by fearing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I mean. But where there is no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, in like manner there is no amendment; where there is no amendment, repentance is of necessity vain, for it lacks the fruit for which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sowed it; that is, man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For God&mdash; after so many and so great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> temerity, begun by the first of the race, Adam, after the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, together with the dowry of the world  after his ejection from paradise and subjection to death&mdash; when He had hasted back to His own mercy, did from that time onward inaugurate repentance in His own self, by rescinding the sentence of His first <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, engaging to grant pardon to His own work and image.  And so He gathered together a people for Himself, and fostered them with many liberal distributions of His bounty, and, after so often finding them most ungrateful, ever exhorted them to repentance and sent out the voices of the universal company of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to prophesy. By and by, promising freely the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which in the last times He was intending to pour as a flood of light on the universal world  through His Spirit, He bade the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of repentance lead the way, with the view of first preparing,  by means of the sign and seal of repentance, them whom He was calling, through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to (inherit) the promise surely made to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. John holds not his peace, saying, <q>Enter upon repentance, for now shall <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> approach the nations</q> &mdash; the Lord, that is, bringing <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> according to God's promise. To Him John, as His harbinger, directed the repentance (which he preached), whose province was the purging of men's minds, that whatever defilement inveterate <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> had imparted, whatever contamination in the heart of man <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> had engendered, <em>that</em> repentance should sweep and scrape away, and cast out of doors, and thus prepare the home of the heart, by making it clean, for the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who was about to supervene, that He might with pleasure introduce Himself there-into, together with His celestial blessings. Of these blessings the title is <em>briefly</em> one&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of man&mdash; the abolition of former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> being the preliminary step. This  is the (final) <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of repentance, this her work, in taking in hand the business of divine mercy. What is profitable to man does service to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <em>rule</em> of repentance, however, which we learn when we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Lord, retains a definite form,&mdash; <em>viz</em>., that no violent hands so to speak, be ever laid on <em>good</em> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> or thoughts.  For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, never giving His sanction to the reprobation of good <em><a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a></em>, inasmuch as they are His own (of which, being the author, He must necessarily be the defender too), is in like manner the acceptor of them, and if the acceptor, likewise the rewarder. Let, then, the ingratitude of men see to it,  if it attaches repentance even to good works; let their gratitude see to it too, if the desire of earning it be the incentive to well-doing: earthly and mortal are they each. For how small is your gain if you do good to a grateful man! Or your loss if to an ungrateful! A <em>good</em> deed has God as its debtor, just as an <em><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></em> has too; for a judge is rewarder of every <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Well, since, God as Judge presides over the exacting and maintaining  of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which to Him is most dear; and since it is with an eye to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that He appoints all the sum of His discipline, is there room for doubting that, just as in all our acts universally, so also in the case of repentance, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> must be rendered to God?&mdash; which duty can indeed only be fulfilled on the condition that repentance be brought to bear <em>only</em> on <em><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></em>. Further, no deed but an <em><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></em> one deserves to be called <em><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em>, nor does any one <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> by well-doing. But if he does not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, why does he invade (the province of) repentance, the private ground of such as do <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>? Why does he impose on his goodness a duty proper to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>? Thus it comes to pass that, when a thing is called into play where it ought not, there, where it ought, it is neglected.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Sins May Be Divided into Corporeal and Spiritual. Both Equally Subject, If Not to Human, Yet to Divine Investigation and Punishment.</h2> 

<p>What things, then, they be for which repentance seems just and due&mdash; that is, what things are to be set down under the head of <em><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em>&mdash; the occasion indeed demands that I should note down; but (to do so) may seem to be unnecessary. For when the Lord is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, our spirit, having been <q>looked back upon</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038434"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse61">Luke&nbsp;22:61</a></span> by its own Author, emerges unbidden into the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and being admitted to (an acquaintance with) the divine precepts, is by them immediately instructed that <q>that from which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bids us abstain is to be accounted <em><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em>:</q> inasmuch as, since it is generally agreed that God is some great <em><a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a></em> of good, of course nothing but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> would be displeasing to good; in that, between things mutually contrary, friendship there is none. Still it will not be irksome briefly to touch upon the fact  that, of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, some are carnal, that is, corporeal; some spiritual. For since man is composed of this combination of a two-fold substance, the sources of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are no other than the sources of his composition. But it is not the fact that body and spirit are two things that constitute the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> mutually different&mdash; otherwise they are on this account rather <em>equal</em>, because the <em>two</em> make up <em>one</em>&mdash; lest any make the distinction between their <em><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></em> proportionate to the difference between their <em>substances</em>, so as to esteem the one lighter, or else heavier, than the other: if it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, (as it is,) that both flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> are creatures of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; one wrought by His hand, one consummated by His <em>afflatus</em>. Since, then, they equally pertain to the Lord, whichever of them <em><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></em> equally <em>offends</em> the Lord. Is it for you to distinguish the acts of the flesh and the spirit, whose communion and conjunction in life, in death, and in resurrection, are so intimate, that <q>at that time</q>  they are equally raised up either for life or else for judgment; because, to wit, they have equally either <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> or lived innocently? This we would (once for all) premise, in order that we may understand that no less necessity for repentance is incumbent on <em>either</em> part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if in anything it have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, than on <em>both</em>. The <em>guilt</em> of both is common; common, too, is the <em>Judge</em>&mdash; God to wit; common, therefore, is withal the healing medicine of repentance. The source whence <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are named <q>spiritual</q> and <q>corporeal</q> is the fact that every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is matter either of <em>act</em> or else of <em>thought</em>: so that what is in <em>deed</em> is <q>corporeal,</q> because a <em>deed</em>, like a <em>body</em>, is capable of being <em>seen</em> and <em>touched</em>; what is in the <em>mind</em> is <q>spiritual,</q> because <em>spirit</em> is neither <em>seen</em> nor <em>handled</em>: by which consideration is shown that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not of <em>deed</em> only, but of <em>will</em> too, are to be shunned, and by repentance purged. For if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> finitude  judges only <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <em>deed</em>, because it is not equal to (piercing) the lurking-places of the <em>will</em>, let us not on that account make light of crimes of the will in God's sight. God is all-sufficient. Nothing from whence any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatsoever proceeds is remote from His sight; because He is neither <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, nor does He omit to decree it to judgment. He is no dissembler of, nor double-dealer with,  His own clear-sightedness. What (shall we say of the fact) that <em>will</em> is the <em>origin</em> of <em>deed</em>? For if any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are imputed to chance, or to necessity, or to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, let them see to themselves: if these be excepted, there is no sinning save by <em>will</em>. Since, then, will is the origin of deed, is it not so much the rather amenable to penalty as it is first in guilt? Nor, if some difficulty interferes with its full accomplishment, is it even in that case exonerated; for it is itself imputed to itself: nor; having done the work which lay in its own power, will it be excusable by reason of that miscarriage of its accomplishment. In fact, how does the Lord demonstrate Himself as adding a superstructure to the Law, except by interdicting <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the <em>will</em> as well (as other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>); while He defines not only the man who had actually invaded another's wedlock to be an adulterer, but likewise him who had contaminated (a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>) by the concupiscence of his gaze?  Accordingly it is dangerous enough for the mind to set before itself what it is forbidden to perform, and rashly through the will to perfect its execution. And since the power of this will is such that, even without fully sating its self-gratification, it stands for a deed; as a deed, therefore, it shall be punished. It is utterly vain to say, <q>I <em>willed</em>, but yet I <em>did</em> not.</q> Rather you <em>ought</em> to carry the thing through, <em>because</em> you will; or else not to will, because you do not carry it through. But, by the confession of your consciousness, you pronounce your own condemnation. For if you eagerly desired a <em>good</em> thing, you would have been anxious to carry it through; in like manner, as you do not carry an <em><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></em> thing through, you ought not to have eagerly desired it. Wherever you take your stand, you are fast bound by guilt; because you have either <em>willed</em> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or else have not <em>fulfilled</em> good.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Repentance Applicable to All the Kinds of Sin. To Be Practised Not Only, Nor Chiefly, for the Good It Brings, But Because God Commands It</h2>

<p>To all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, then, committed whether by flesh or spirit, whether by deed or will, the same <em>God</em> who has destined penalty by means of judgment, has withal engaged to grant pardon by means of repentance, saying to the people, <q>Repent you, and I will save you;</q>  and again, <q>I live, says the Lord, and I will (have) repentance rather than death.</q>  Repentance, then, is <q>life,</q> since it is preferred to <q>death.</q> That repentance, O sinner, like myself (nay, rather, less than myself, for pre-eminence in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> I acknowledge to be mine ), do you so hasten to, so embrace, as a shipwrecked man the protection  of some plank. This will draw you forth when sunk in the waves of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and will bear you forward into the port of the divine clemency. Seize the opportunity of unexpected felicity: that you, who sometime were in God's sight nothing but <q>a drop of a bucket,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038444"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;40:15</a></span> and <q>dust of the threshing-floor,</q>  and <q>a potter's vessel,</q>  may thenceforward become that <q>tree which is sown beside  the waters, is perennial in leaves, bears fruit at its own time,</q>  and shall not see <q>fire,</q>  nor <q>axe.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038450"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;3:10</a></span> Having found <q>the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038451"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> repent of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>; repent of having loved what God loves not: even we ourselves do not permit our slave-lads not to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the things which are offensive to us; for the principle of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>  consists in similarity of minds.</p>

<p>To reckon up the good, of repentance, the subject-matter is copious, and therefore should be committed to great eloquence. Let us, however, in proportion to our narrow abilities, inculcate one point&mdash;that what God enjoins is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and best. I hold it audacity to dispute about the <q>good</q> of a divine precept; for, indeed, it is not the fact that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which binds us to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, but the fact that God has enjoined it. To exact the rendering of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> the majesty of divine power has the prior  right; the authority of Him who commands is prior to the utility of him who serves. <q>Is it good to repent, or no?</q> Why do you ponder? God enjoins; nay, He not merely enjoins, but likewise exhorts. He invites by (offering) reward&mdash; <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, to wit; even by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, saying <q>I live,</q>  He desires that credence may be given Him. Oh blessed we, for whose sake God swears! Oh most miserable, if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not the Lord even when He swears! What, therefore, God so highly commends, what He even (after <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fashion) attests on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, we are bound of course to approach, and to guard with the utmost seriousness; that, abiding permanently in (the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of) the solemn pledge  of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, we may be able also to persevere in like manner in its fruit  and its benefit.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Sin Never to Be Returned to After Repentance.</h2> 

<p>For what I say is this, that the repentance which, being shown us and commanded us through God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, recalls us to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>  with the Lord, when once learned and undertaken by us ought never afterward to be cancelled by repetition of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. No pretext of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> now remains to plead on your behalf; in that, after acknowledging the Lord, and accepting His precepts &mdash; in short, after engaging in repentance of (past) <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>&mdash; you again betake yourself to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Thus, in as far as you are removed from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, in so far are you cemented  to contumacy. For if the ground on which you had repented of having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> was that you had begun to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord, why have you preferred to rescind what you did for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear's</a> sake, except because you have ceased to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? For there is no other thing but contumacy which subverts <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Since there is no exception which defends from liability to penalty even such as are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the Lord&mdash; because <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, openly as He is set before men, and comprehensible as He is even on the score of His heavenly benefits, is not possible &mdash; how perilous is it for Him to be despised when <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>? Now, that man does despise Him, who, after attaining by His help to an understanding of things good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, often an affront to his own understanding&mdash; that is, to God's gift&mdash; by resuming what he understands ought to be shunned, and what he has already shunned: he rejects the Giver in abandoning the gift; he denies the Benefactor in not honouring the benefit. How can he be pleasing to Him, whose gift is displeasing to himself? Thus he is shown to be not only contumacious toward the Lord, but likewise ungrateful. Besides, that man commits no light <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the Lord, who, after he had by repentance renounced His rival the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and had under this appellation subjected him to the Lord, again upraises him by his own return (to the enemy), and makes himself a ground of exultation to him; so that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>, with his prey recovered, rejoices anew against the Lord. Does he not&mdash; what is perilous even to say, but must be put forward with a view to edification&mdash; place the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> before the Lord? For he seems to have made the comparison who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> each; and to have judicially pronounced him to be the better whose (servant) he has preferred again to be. Thus he who, through repentance for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, had begun to make satisfaction to the Lord, will, through another repentance of his repentance, make satisfaction to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and will be the more hateful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in proportion as he will be the more acceptable to His rival. But some say that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is satisfied if He be looked up to with the heart and the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, even if this be not done in <em>outward</em> act, and that thus they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without damage to their <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>:</q> that is, that they violate wedlock without damage to their <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; they mingle poison for their parent without damage to their filial duty! Thus, then, they will themselves withal be thrust down into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> without damage to their pardon, while they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without damage to their <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>! Here is a primary example of perversity: they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>!  I suppose, if they feared not, they would not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>! Let him, therefore, who would not have God offended not revere Him at all, if <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>  is the plea for offending. But these dispositions have been wont to sprout from the seed of hypocrites, whose friendship with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is indivisible, whose repentance never faithful.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Baptism Not to Be Presumptously Received. It Requires Preceding Repentance, Manifested by Amendment of Life</h2>

<p>Whatever, then, our poor ability has attempted to suggest with reference to laying hold of repentance once for all, and perpetually retaining it, does indeed bear upon <em>all</em> who are given up to the Lord, as being all competitors for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in earning the favour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but is chiefly urgent in the case of those young novices who are only just beginning to bedew <span class="stiki" id="note038464"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:2</a></span> their ears with divine discourses, and who, as whelps in yet early infancy, and with eyes not yet perfect, creep about uncertainly, and say indeed that they renounce their former deed, and assume (the profession of) repentance, but neglect to complete it.  For the very end of desiring importunes them to desire somewhat of their former <em><a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a></em>; just as fruits, when they are already beginning to turn into the sourness or bitterness of age, do yet still in some part flatter  their own loveliness. Moreover, a presumptuous confidence in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> introduces all kind of vicious delay and tergiversation with regard to repentance; for, feeling sure of undoubted pardon of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <em>men</em> meanwhile steal the intervening time, and make it for themselves into a holiday-time  for sinning, rather than a time for learning not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Further, how inconsistent is it to expect pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (to be granted) to a repentance which they have not fulfilled! This is to hold out your hand for merchandise, but not produce the price. For repentance is the price at which the Lord has determined to award pardon: He proposes the redemption  of release from penalty at this compensating exchange of repentance. If, then, sellers first examine the coin with which they make their bargains, to see whether it be cut, or scraped, or adulterated,  we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> likewise that the Lord, when about to make us the grant of so costly merchandise, even of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, first institutes a probation of our repentance. <q>But meanwhile let us defer the reality of our repentance: it will then, I suppose, be clear that we are amended when we are absolved.</q>  By no means; (but our amendment should be manifested) while, pardon being in abeyance, there is still a prospect of penalty; while <em>the penitent</em> does not yet merit&mdash; so far as merit we can&mdash; his liberation; while God is threatening, not while He is forgiving. For what slave, after his position has been changed by reception of freedom, charges himself with his (past) thefts and desertions? What soldier, after his discharge, makes satisfaction for his (former) brands? A sinner is bound to bemoan himself <em>before</em> receiving pardon, because the time of repentance is coincident with that of peril and of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Not that I deny that the divine benefit&mdash; the putting away of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, I mean&mdash; is in every way sure to such as are on the point of entering the (baptismal) water; but what we have to labour for is, that it may be granted us to attain that blessing. For who will grant to you, a man of so faithless repentance, one single sprinkling of any water whatever? To approach it by stealth, indeed, and to get the minister appointed over this business misled by your asseverations, is easy; but God takes foresight for His own treasure, and suffers not the unworthy to steal a march upon it. What, in fact, does He say? <q>Nothing hid which shall not be revealed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038471"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse17">Luke&nbsp;8:17</a></span> Draw whatever (veil of) darkness you please over your <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038472"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:5</a></span> But some think as if God were under a <em>necessity</em> of bestowing even on the unworthy, what He has engaged (to give); and they turn His liberality into slavery. But if it is of necessity that God grants us the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of death,  then He does so <em>unwillingly</em>. But who permits a gift to be permanently retained which he has granted unwillingly? For do not many afterward fall out of (<a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>)? Is not this gift taken away from many? These, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, are they who do steal a march upon (the treasure), who, after approaching to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of repentance, set up on the sands a house doomed to ruin. Let no one, then, flatter himself on the ground of being assigned to the <q>recruit-classes</q> of learners, as if on that account he have a licence even now to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. As soon as you <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Lord,</q>  you should <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him; as soon as you have gazed on Him, you should reverence Him. But what difference does <em>your</em> <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a></q> Him make, while you rest in the same practises as in days bygone, when you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him <em>not</em>? What, moreover, is it which distinguishes you from a perfected  servant of God? Is there one Christ for the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, another for the learners? Have they some different hope or reward? Some different dread of judgment? Some different necessity for repentance? That <em>baptismal</em> washing is a sealing of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is begun and is commended by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of repentance. We are not washed <em>in order that</em> we <em>may</em> cease sinning, but <em>because</em> we <em>have</em> ceased, since in <em>heart</em> we have <em>been</em> bathed  already. For the <em>first</em> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of a learner is <em>this</em>, a perfect <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>;  thenceforward, in so far as you have understanding of the Lord <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <em>is</em> sound, the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> having once for all embraced repentance. Otherwise, if it is (only) after the <em>baptismal</em> waters that we cease sinning, it is of <em>necessity</em>, not of <em><a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a></em>, that we put on innocence. Who, then, is pre-eminent in goodness? He who is not <em>allowed</em>, or he whom <em>it displeases</em>, to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? He who is <em>bidden</em>, or he whose <em>pleasure it is</em>, to be free from crime? Let us, then, neither keep our hands from theft unless the hardness of bars withstand us, nor refrain our eyes from the concupiscence of fornication unless we be withdrawn by guardians of our <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, if no one who has surrendered himself to the Lord is to cease sinning unless he be bound thereto by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. But if any entertain this sentiment, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether he, after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, do not feel more sadness to think that he has <em>ceased</em> from sinning, than <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> that he has <em>escaped</em> from it. And so it is becoming that learners <em>desire</em> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but do not hastily <em>receive</em> it: for he who desires it, honours it; he who hastily receives it, disdains it: in the one appears modesty, in the other arrogance; the former satisfies, the latter neglects it; the former <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covets</a> to merit it, but the latter promises it to himself as a due return; the former takes, the latter usurps it. Whom would you judge worthier, except one who is more amended? Whom more amended, except one who is more timid, and on that account has fulfilled the duty of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> repentance? For he has feared to continue still in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, lest he should not merit the reception <em>of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a></em>. But the hasty receiver, inasmuch as he promised it himself (as his due), being forsooth secure (of obtaining it), <em>could</em> not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: thus he fulfilled not repentance either, because he lacked the instrumental agent of repentance, that is, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.  Hasty reception is the portion of irreverence; it inflates the seeker, it despises the Giver. And thus it sometimes deceives,  for it promises to itself <em>the gift</em> before it be due; whereby He who is to furnish <em>the gift</em> is ever offended.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Of Repentance, in the Case of Such as Have Lapsed After Baptism</h2>

<p>So long, Lord Christ, may the blessing of learning or hearing concerning the discipline of repentance be granted to Your servants, as is likewise behooves them, while <em>learners</em>,  not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; in other words, may they thereafter <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of repentance, <em>and</em> require nothing of it. It is irksome to append mention of a <em>second</em>&mdash; nay, in that case, the <em>last</em>&mdash; hope;  lest, by treating of a remedial repenting yet in reserve, we seem to be pointing to a yet further space for sinning. Far be it that any one so interpret our meaning, as if, because there is an opening for repenting, there were even now, on that account, an opening for sinning; and <em>as if</em> the redundance of celestial clemency constituted a licence for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> temerity. Let no one be less good because God is more so, by repeating his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as often as he is forgiven. Otherwise be sure he will find an end of <em>escaping</em>, when he shall not find one of <em>sinning</em>. We have escaped <em>once</em>: thus far <em>and no farther</em> let us commit ourselves to perils, even if we seem likely to escape a second time.  Men in general, after escaping shipwreck, thenceforward declare <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> with ship and sea; and by <em>cherishing</em> the memory of the danger, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the benefit conferred by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;their deliverance, namely. I praise their <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their reverence; they are unwilling a second time to be a burden to the divine mercy; they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to seem to trample on <em>the benefit</em> which they have attained; they shun, with a solicitude which at all events is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to make trial a second time of that which they have once learned to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Thus the limit of their temerity is the evidence of their <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, man's <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>  is an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But however, that most stubborn foe (of ours) never gives his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> leisure; indeed, he is then most savage when he fully feels that a man is freed <em>from his clutches</em>; he then flames fiercest while he is fast becoming extinguished. Grieve and groan he must of necessity over the fact that, by the grant of pardon, so many works of death  in man have been overthrown, so many marks of the condemnation which formerly was his own erased. He grieves that that sinner, (now) Christ's servant, is destined to judge him and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note038485"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:3</a></span> And so he observes, assaults, besieges him, in the hope that he may be able in some way either to strike his eyes with carnal concupiscence, or else to entangle his mind with worldly enticements, or else to subvert his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of earthly power, or else to wrest him from the sure way by perverse traditions: he is never deficient in stumbling-blocks nor in <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. These poisons of his, therefore, God foreseeing, although the gate of forgiveness has been shut and fastened up with the bar of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, has permitted <em>it</em> still to stand somewhat open.  In the vestibule He has stationed the second repentance for opening to such as knock: but now <em>once for all</em>, because now for the second time;  but never more because the last time it had been in vain. For is not even this <em>once</em> enough? You have what you now deserved not, for you had lost what you had received. If the Lord's indulgence grants you the means of restoring what you had lost, be thankful for the benefit renewed, not to say amplified; for <em>restoring</em> is a greater thing than <em>giving</em>, inasmuch as <em>having lost</em> is more miserable than never having <em>received</em> at all. However, if any do incur the debt of a second repentance, his spirit is not to be immediately cut down and undermined by despair. Let it by all means be irksome to <em><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em> again, but let not to <em>repent</em> again be irksome: irksome to imperil one's self again, but not to be again set free. Let none be ashamed. Repeated sickness must have repeated medicine. You will show your gratitude to the Lord by not refusing what the Lord offers you. You have offended, but can still be reconciled. You have One whom you may satisfy, and Him willing. </p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Examples from Scripture to Prove the Lord's Willingness to Pardon</h2>

<p>This if you <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, unravel  the meaning of <q>what the Spirit says to the churches.</q>  He imputes to the Ephesians <q>forsaken <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038491"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse4">Revelation&nbsp;2:4</a></span> reproaches the Thyatirenes with <q>fornication,</q> and <q>eating of things <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038492"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse20">Revelation&nbsp;2:20</a></span> accuses the Sardians of <q>works not full;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038493"><a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse2">Revelation&nbsp;3:2</a></span> censures the Pergamenes for teaching perverse things; <span class="stiki" id="note038494"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse14">Revelation&nbsp;2:14-15</a></span> upbraids the Laodiceans for trusting to their riches; <span class="stiki" id="note038495"><a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse17">Revelation&nbsp;3:17</a></span> and yet gives them all general monitions to repentance&mdash; under comminations, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but He would not utter comminations to one <em>un</em>repentant if He did not forgive the repentant. The matter were doubtful if He had not withal elsewhere demonstrated this profusion of His clemency. Says He not,  <q>He who has fallen shall rise again, and he who has been <em>a</em>verted shall be <em>con</em>verted?</q> He it is, indeed, who <q>would have mercy rather than <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.</q>  The heavens, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are there, are glad at a man's repentance. <span class="stiki" id="note038498"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;15:7,&nbsp;10</a></span> Ho!

Is not the fact that a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has lost a drachma, and seeks it and finds it, and invites her female friends to share her <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, an example of a restored sinner? <span class="stiki" id="note038499"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;15:8-10</a></span> There strays, withal, one little ewe of the shepherd's; but the flock was not more dear than the one: that one is earnestly sought; the one is longed for instead of all; and at length she is found, and is borne back on the shoulders of the shepherd himself; for much had she toiled  in straying. <span class="stiki" id="note038501"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;15:3-7</a></span> That most gentle father, likewise, I will not pass over in silence, who calls his prodigal son home, and willingly receives him repentant after his indigence, slays his best fatted calf, and graces his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> with a banquet. <span class="stiki" id="note038502"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;15:11-32</a></span> Why not?

He, then, will receive you, His own son,  back, even if you have squandered what you had received from Him, even if you return naked&mdash; just because you <em>have</em> returned; and will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> more over your return than over the sobriety of the other;  but <em>only</em> if you heartily repent&mdash; if you compare your own hunger with the plenty of your Father's <q>hired servants</q>&mdash; if you leave behind you the swine, that unclean herd&mdash; if you again seek your Father, offended though He be, saying, <q>I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, nor am worthy any longer to be called Yours.</q> Confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> lightens, as much as dissimulation aggravates them; for confession is counselled by (a desire to make) satisfaction, dissimulation by contumacy.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Concerning the Outward Manifestations by Which This Second Repentance is to Be Accompanied</h2>

<p>The narrower, then, the sphere of action of this second and only (remaining) repentance, the more laborious is its probation; in order that it may not be exhibited in the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> alone, but may likewise be carried out in some (external) act. This act, which is more usually expressed and commonly spoken of under a Greek name, is <span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03BE;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x1F79;&#x03B3;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>,  whereby we confess our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to the Lord, not indeed as if He were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of them, but inasmuch as by confession satisfaction is settled,  of confession repentance is born; by repentance God is appeased. And thus <em>exomologesis</em> is a discipline for man's prostration and humiliation, enjoining a demeanor calculated to move mercy. With regard also to the very dress and food, it commands (the penitent) to lie in sackcloth and ashes, to cover his body in mourning,  to lay his spirit low in sorrows, to exchange for severe treatment the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he has committed; moreover, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no food and drink but such as is plain&mdash;not for the stomach's sake, to wit, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a>; for the most part, however, to feed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> on <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, to groan, to weep and make outcries  unto the Lord your  <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; to bow before the feet of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and kneel to God's dear ones; to enjoin on all the brethren to be ambassadors to bear his  deprecatory supplication (before God). All this <em>exomologesis</em> (does), that it may enhance repentance; may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> God by its <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the (incurred) danger; may, by itself pronouncing against the sinner, stand in the stead of God's indignation, and by temporal mortification (I will not say frustrate, but) expunge <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishments. Therefore, while it abases the man, it raises him; while it covers him with squalor, it renders him more clean; while it <em>ac</em>cuses, it <em>ex</em>cuses; while it condemns, it absolves. The less quarter you give yourself, the more (<a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me) will God give you.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Of Men's Shrinking from This Second Repentance and Exomologesis, and of the Unreasonableness of Such Shrinking</h2>

<p>Yet most men either shun this work, as being a public exposure  of themselves, or else defer it from day to day. I presume (as being) more mindful of modesty than of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; just like men who, having contracted some malady in the more private parts of the body, avoid the privity of physicians, and so perish with their own bashfulness. It is intolerable, forsooth, to modesty to make satisfaction to the offended Lord! To be restored to its forfeited  <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>! Truly you are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> in your modesty; bearing an open forehead for sinning, but an abashed one for deprecating! I give no place to bashfulness when I am a gainer by its loss; when itself in some son exhorts the man, saying, <q>Respect not me; it is better that I perish through  you, <em>i.e. than you through me</em>.</q> At all events, the time when (if ever) its danger is serious, is when it is a butt for jeering speech in the presence of insulters, where one man raises himself on his neighbour's ruin, where there is upward clambering over the prostrate. But among brethren and fellow-servants, where there is common hope, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>,  <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, grief, suffering, because there is a common Spirit from a common Lord and Father, why do you think these <em>brothers</em> to be anything other than yourself? Why flee from the partners of your own mischances, as from such as will derisively cheer them? The body cannot feel <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> at the trouble of any one member, <span class="stiki" id="note038516"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:26</a></span> it must necessarily join with one consent in the grief, and in labouring for the remedy. In a company of two  is the church;  but the church is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  When, then, you cast yourself at the brethren's knees, you are handling <em>Christ</em>, you are entreating <em>Christ</em>. In like manner, when they shed tears over you, it is <em>Christ</em> who suffers, <em>Christ</em> who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> the Father for mercy. What a son  asks is ever easily obtained. Grand indeed is the reward of modesty, which the concealment of our fault promises us! To wit, if we do hide somewhat from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, shall we equally conceal it from God? Are the judgment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God so put upon a par? Is it better to be damned in secret than absolved in public? <em>But you say</em>, <q>It is a miserable thing thus to come to <em>exomologesis</em>:</q> yes, for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> does bring to misery; but where repentance is to be made, the misery ceases, because it is turned into something salutary. Miserable it is to be cut, and cauterized, and racked with the pungency of some (medicinal) powder: still, the things which heal by unpleasant means do, by the benefit of the cure, excuse their own offensiveness, and make present injury bearable for the sake  of the advantage to supervene.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Further Strictures on the Same Subject</h2>

<p>What if, besides the shame which they make the most account of, <em>men</em> dread likewise the bodily inconveniences; in that, unwashen, sordidly attired, estranged from <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, they must spend their time in the roughness of sackcloth, and the horridness of ashes, and the sunkenness of face caused by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>? Is it then becoming for us to supplicate for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in scarlet and purple? Hasten hither with the pin for panning the hair, and the powder for polishing the teeth, and some forked implement of steel or brass for cleaning the nails. Whatever of false brilliance, whatever of feigned redness, <em>is to be had</em>, let him diligently apply it to his lips or cheeks. Let him furthermore seek out baths of more genial temperature in some gardened or seaside retreat; let him enlarge his expenses; let him carefully seek the rarest delicacy of fatted fowls; let him refine his old wine: and when any shall ask him, <q>On whom are you lavishing all this?</q> let him say, <q>I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and am in peril of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> perishing: and so now I am drooping, and wasting and torturing myself, that I may reconcile God to myself, whom by sinning I have offended.</q> Why, they who go about canvassing for the obtaining of civil office, feel it neither degrading nor irksome to struggle, in behalf of such their desires, with annoyances to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; and not annoyances merely, but likewise contumelies of all kinds. What meannesses of dress do they not affect? What houses do they not beset with early and late visits?&mdash; bowing whenever they meet any high personage, frequenting no banquets, associating in no entertainments, but voluntarily exiled from the felicity of freedom and festivity: and all that for the sake of the fleeting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of a single year! Do <em>we</em> hesitate, when <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is at stake, to endure what the competitor for consulship or pr&aelig;torship puts up with?  and shall we be tardy in offering to the offended Lord a self-chastisement in food and raiment, which  <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> lay upon themselves when they have offended no one at all? Such are they of whom Scripture makes mention: <q>Woe to them who bind their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as it were with a long rope.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Final Considerations to Induce to Exomologesis</h2>

<p>If you shrink back from <em>exomologesis</em>, consider in your heart the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>,  which <em>exomologesis</em> will extinguish for you; and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> first the magnitude of the penalty, that you may not hesitate about the adoption of the remedy. What do we esteem that treasure-house of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> to be, when small vent-holes  of it rouse such blasts of flames that neighbouring cities either are already no more, or are in daily expectation of the same <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>? The haughtiest  mountains start asunder in the birth-throes of their inwardly-gendered fire; and&mdash; which proves to us the <em>perpetuity</em> of the judgment&mdash; though they start asunder, though they be devoured, yet come they never to an end. Who will not account these occasional punishments inflicted on the mountains as examples of the judgment which menaces the impenitent? Who will not agree that such sparks are but some few missiles and sportive darts of some inestimably vast centre of fire? Therefore, since you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that after the first bulwarks of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>  there still remains for you, in <em>exomologesis</em> a second reserve of aid against <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, why do you desert your own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? Why are you tardy to approach what you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> heals you? Even dumb irrational animals recognise in their time of need the medicines which have been divinely assigned them. The stag, transfixed by the arrow, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that, to force out the steel, and its inextricable lingerings, he must heal himself with dittany. The swallow, if she blinds her young, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to give them eyes again by means of her own swallow-wort.  Shall the sinner, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that <em>exomologesis</em> has been instituted by the Lord for his restoration, pass that by which restored the Babylonian king  to his realms? Long time had he offered to the Lord his repentance, working out his <em>exomologesis</em> by a seven years' squalor, with his nails wildly growing after the eagle's fashion, and his unkempt hair wearing the shagginess of a lion. Hard handling! Him whom men were shuddering at, God was receiving back. But, on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> emperor&mdash; who, after pursuing  the once afflicted people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, long denied to their Lord, rushed into the battle &mdash; did, after so many warning plagues, perish in the parted sea, (which was permitted to be passable to <q>the People</q> alone,) by the backward roll of the waves: <span class="stiki" id="note038532"><a href="../bible/exo014.htm#verse15">Exodus&nbsp;14:15-31</a></span> for repentance and her handmaid  <em>exomologesis</em> he had cast away.</p>

<p>Why should I add more touching these two planks  (as it were) of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, caring more for the business of the pen  than the duty of my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>? For, sinner as I am of every dye,  and born for nothing save repentance, I cannot easily be silent about that concerning which also the very head and fount of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> offense, Adam, restored by <em>exomologesis</em> to his own paradise,  is not silent.</p>
