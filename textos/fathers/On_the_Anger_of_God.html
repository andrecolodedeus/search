<h1>On the Anger of God</h1>


<p class="h1a">Addressed to Donatus</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; Of Divine and Human Wisdom.</h2>

<p>I have often observed, Donatus, that many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> hold this opinion, which some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> also have maintained, that God is not subject to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; since the divine nature is either altogether beneficent, and that it is inconsistent with His surpassing and excellent power to do injury to any one; or, at any rate, He takes no notice of us at all, so that no advantage comes to us from His goodness, and no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from His ill-will. But the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of these men, because it is very great, and tends to overthrow the condition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, must be refuted by us, lest you yourself also should be deceived, being incited by the authority of men who deem themselves wise. Nor, however, are we so arrogant as to boast that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is comprehended by our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>; but we follow the teaching of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who alone is able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and to reveal secret things. But the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, being destitute of this teaching, have imagined that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things can be ascertained by conjecture. But this is impossible; because the mind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, enclosed in the dark abode of the body, is far removed from the perception of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: and in this the divine nature differs from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is the property of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the divine nature. </p>

<p>On which account we have need of some light to dispel the darkness by which the reflection of man is overspread, since, while we live in mortal flesh, we are unable to divine by our senses. But the light of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and he who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and admitted Him into his breast will acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with an enlightened heart; but when God and heavenly instruction are removed, all things are full of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. And Socrates, though he was the most learned of all the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, yet, that he might prove the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the others, who thought that they possessed something, rightly said that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing, except one thing&mdash; that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing. For he understood that that learning had nothing certain, nothing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in itself; nor, as some <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, did he pretend  to learning that he might refute others, but he saw the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in some measure. And he testified even on his trial (as is related by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>) that there was no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom. He so despised, derided, and cast aside the learning in which the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> then boasted, that he professed that very thing as the greatest learning, that he had learned that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing. If, therefore, there is no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom, as Socrates taught, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> handed down, it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is divine, and belongs to no other than to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore God must be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, in whom alone is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. He is the Parent of the world, and the Framer of all things; who is not seen with the eyes, and is scarcely distinguished by the mind; whose religion is accustomed to be attacked in many ways by those who have neither been able to attain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom, nor to comprehend the system of the great and heavenly secret. </p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; Of the Truth and Its Steps, and of God.</h2>

<p>For since there are many steps by which the ascent is made to the abode of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it is not easy for any one to reach the summit. For when the eyes are darkened by the brightness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they who are unable to maintain a firm step fall back to the level ground.  Now the first step is to understand false <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a>, and to throw aside the impious worship of gods which are made by the hand of man. But the second step is to perceive with the mind that there is but one Supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose power and <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> made the world from the beginning, and afterwards continues to govern it. The third step is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His Servant and Messenger,  whom He sent as His ambassador to the earth, by whose teaching being freed from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in which we were held entangled, and formed to the worship of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we might learn righteousness. From all of these steps, as I have said, there is a rapid and easy gliding to a downfall,  unless the feet are firmly planted with unshaken steadfastness. </p>

<p>We see those shaken off from the first step, who, though they understand things which are false, do not, however, discover that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and though they despised earthly and frail images, do not betake themselves to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of whom they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. But viewing with admiration the elements of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, they worship the heaven, the earth, the sea, the sun, the moon, and the other heavenly bodies. </p>

<p>But we have already reproved their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in the second book of the <em>Divine Institutes</em>.  But we say that those fall from the second step, who, though they understand that there is but one Supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nevertheless, ensnared by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and captivated by false arguments, entertain opinions concerning that excellent majesty far removed from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; who either deny that God has any figure, or think that He is moved by no affection, because every affection is a sign of weakness, which has no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But they are precipitated from the third step, who, though they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Ambassador of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is also the Builder of the divine and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> temple,  either do not receive Him, or receive Him otherwise than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> demands; whom we have partly refuted in the fourth book of the above-named work.  And we will hereafter refute more carefully, when we shall begin to reply to all the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, which, while they dispute,  have destroyed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. </p>

<p>But now we will argue against those who, falling from the second step, entertain wrong sentiments respecting the Supreme God. For some say that He neither does a kindness to any one, nor becomes <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, but in security and quietness enjoys the advantages of His own <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. Others, indeed, take away <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but leave to God kindness; for they think that a nature excelling in the greatest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, while it ought not to be malevolent, ought also to be benevolent. Thus all the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are agreed on the subject of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but are at variance respecting kindness. But, that my speech may descend in order to the proposed subject, a division of this kind must be made and followed by me, since <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and kindness are different, and opposed to one another. Either <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> must be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and kindness taken from Him; or both alike must be taken from Him; or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> must be taken away, and kindness attributed to Him; or neither must be taken away. The nature of the case admits of nothing else besides these; so that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which is sought for, must necessarily be found in some one of these. Let us consider them separately, that reason and arrangement may conduct us to the hiding-place of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; Of the Good and Evil Things in Human Affairs, and of Their Author.</h2>

<p>First, no one ever said this respecting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He is only subject to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and is not influenced by kindness. For it is unsuitable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He should be endowed with a power of this kind, by which He may injure and do harm, but be unable to profit and to do good. What means, therefore, what hope of safety, is proposed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, if God is the author of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> only? For if this is so, that venerable majesty will now be drawn out, not to the power of the judge, to whom it is permitted to preserve and set at liberty, but to the office of the torturer and executioner. But whereas we see that there are not only <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, but also goods, it is plain that if God is the author of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, there must be another who does things contrary to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and gives to us <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. If there is such a one, by what name must he be called? Why is he who injures us more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us than He who benefits us? But if this can be nothing besides <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is absurd and vain to suppose that the divine power, than which nothing is greater or better, is able to injure, but unable to benefit; and accordingly no one has ever <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> who ventured to assert this, because it is neither reasonable nor in any way credible. And because this is agreed upon, let us pass on and seek after the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> elsewhere. </p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; Of God and His Affections, and the Censure of Epicurus.</h2>

<p>That which follows is concerning the school of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>; that as there is no <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so indeed there is no kindness. For when <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> thought that it was inconsistent with God to injure and to inflict harm, which for the most part arises from the affection of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, he took away from Him beneficence also, since he saw that it followed that if God has <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, He must also have kindness. Therefore, lest he should concede to Him a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, he deprived Him also of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.  From this, he says, He is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> and uncorrupted, because He cares about nothing, and neither takes trouble Himself nor occasions it to another. Therefore He is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if He is neither moved, which is peculiar to a living being, nor does anything impossible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which is peculiar to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if He has no will at all, no action, in short, no administration, which is worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And what greater, what more worthy administration can be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, than the government of the world, and especially of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, to which all earthly things are subject? </p>

<p>What <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, then, can there be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if He is always inactive, being at rest and unmoveable? If He is deaf to those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to Him, and blind to His worshippers? What is so worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so befitting to Him, as <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>? But if He cares for nothing, and foresees nothing, He has lost all His divinity. What else does he say, who takes from God all power and all substance, except that there is no God at all? In short, Marcus Tullius relates that it was said by Posidonius,  that <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> understood that there were no gods, but that he said those things which he spoke respecting the gods for the sake of driving away odium; and so that he leaves the gods in words, but takes them away in reality, since he gives them no motion, no office. But if this is so, what can be more deceitful than him? And this ought to be foreign to the character of a wise and weighty man. But if he understood one thing and spoke another, what else is he to be called than a deceiver, double-tongued, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and moreover foolish? But <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> was not so crafty as to say those things with the desire of deceiving, when he consigned these things also by his writings to everlasting remembrance; but he erred through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For, being led from the beginning by the probability  of a single opinion, he necessarily fell into those things which followed. For the first opinion was, that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> was not consistent with the character of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And when this appeared to him to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and unassailable,  he was unable to refuse the consequences; because one affection being removed, necessity itself compelled him to remove from God the other affections also. Thus, he who is not subject to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is plainly uninfluenced by kindness, which is the opposite feeling to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Now, if there is neither <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> nor kindness in Him, it is manifest that there is neither <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, nor grief, nor pity. For all the affections have one system, one motion,  which cannot be the case with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if there is no affection in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because whatever is subject to affections is weak, it follows that there is in Him neither the care of anything, nor <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. </p>

<p>The disputation of the wise man  extends thus far: he was silent as to the other things which follow; namely, that because there is in Him neither care nor <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, therefore there is no reflection nor any perception in Him, by which it is effected that He has no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> at all. Thus, when he had gradually descended, he remained on the last step, because he now saw the precipice. But what does it avail to have remained silent, and concealed the danger? Necessity compelled him even against his will to fall. For he said that which he did not mean, because he so arranged his argument that he necessarily came to that point which he wished to avoid. You see, therefore, to what point he comes, when <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is removed and taken away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In short, either no one believes that, or a very few, and they the guilty and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, who hope for impunity for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But if this also is found to be false, that there is neither <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> nor kindness in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let us come to that which is put in the third place. </p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; The Opinion of the Stoics Concerning God; Of His Anger and Kindness.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> and some others are supposed to have entertained much better sentiments respecting the divine nature, who say that there is kindness in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. A very pleasing and popular speech, that God is not subject to such littleness of mind as to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that He is injured by any one, since it is impossible for Him to be injured; so that that serene and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> majesty is excited, disturbed, and maddened, which is the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty. For they say that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a commotion and perturbation of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is inconsistent with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Since, when it falls upon the mind of any one, as a violent tempest it excites such waves that it changes the condition of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the eyes gleam, the countenance trembles, the tongue stammers, the teeth chatter, the countenance is alternately stained now with redness spread over it, now with white paleness. But if <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is unbecoming to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, provided he be of wisdom and authority, how much more is so foul a change unbecoming to God! And if man, when he has authority and power, inflicts widespread injury through <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, sheds blood, overthrows cities, destroys communities, reduces provinces to desolation, how much more is it to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He has power over the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and over the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> itself, would have been about to destroy all things if He were <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. </p>

<p>Therefore they think that so great and so pernicious an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ought to be absent from Him. And if <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and excitement are absent from Him, because it is disfiguring and injurious, and He inflicts injury on no one, they think that nothing else remains, except that He is mild, calm, propitious, beneficent, the preserver. For thus at length He may be called the common Father of all, and the best and greatest, which His divine and heavenly nature demands. For if among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> it appears praiseworthy to do good rather than to injure, to restore to life  rather than to kill, to save rather than to destroy, and innocence is not undeservedly numbered among the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>&mdash;and he who does these things is loved, esteemed, honoured, and celebrated with all blessings and vows,&mdash; in short, on account of his deserts and benefits is judged to be most like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; how much more right is it that God Himself, who excels in divine and perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and who is removed from all earthly taint, should conciliate  the whole race of man by divine and heavenly benefits! Those things are spoken speciously and in a popular manner, and they allure many to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them; but they who entertain these sentiments approach nearer indeed to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but they partly fail, not sufficiently considering the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the case. For if God is not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the impious and the unrighteous, it is clear that He does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and the righteous. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of those is more consistent who take away at once both <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and kindness. For in opposite matters it is necessary to be moved to both sides or to neither. Thus, he who loves the good also <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and he who does not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the good; because the loving of the good arises from the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and the hating of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> has its rise from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the good. There is no one who loves life without a <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of death, nor who is desirous of light, but he who avoids darkness. These things are so connected by nature, that the one cannot exist without the other. </p>

<p>If any master has in his household a good and a bad servant, it is evident that he does not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them both, or confer upon both benefits and honours; for if he does this, he is both <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and foolish. But he addresses the one who is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> with friendly words, and honours him and sets him over his house and household, and all his affairs; but punishes the bad one with reproaches, with stripes, with nakedness, with hunger, with thirst, with fetters: so that the latter may be an example to others to keep them from sinning, and the former to conciliate them; so that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> may restrain some, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> may excite others. He, therefore, who loves also <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>, and he who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> also loves; for there are those who ought to be loved, and there are those who ought to be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>. And as he who loves confers <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things on those whom he loves, so he who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> inflicts <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> upon those whom he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>; which argument, because it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, can in no way be refuted. Therefore the opinion of those is vain and false, who, when they attribute the one to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, take away the other, not less than the opinion of those who take away both. But the latter,  as we have shown, in part do not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, but retain that which is the better of the two; whereas the former,  led on by the accurate method of their reasoning, fall into the greatest <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, because they have assumed premises which are altogether false. For they ought not to have reasoned thus: Because God is not liable to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, therefore He is not moved by kindness; but in this manner: Because God is moved by kindness, therefore He is also liable to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For if it had been certain and undoubted that God is not liable to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, then the other point would necessarily be arrived at. But since the question as to whether God is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> is more open to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, while it is almost perfectly plain that He is kind, it is absurd to wish to subvert that which is certain by means of an uncertainty, since it is easier to confirm uncertain things by means of those which are certain. </p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; That God is Angry.</h2>

<p>These are the opinions entertained by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> respecting God. But if we have discovered that these things which have been spoken are false, there remains that one last resource, in which alone the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> can be found, which has never been embraced by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, nor at any time defended: that it follows that God is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, since He is moved by kindness. This opinion is to be maintained and asserted by us; for  this is the sum and turning-point on which the whole of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and religion depend: and no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> can be due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if He affords nothing to His worshippers; and no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, if He is not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with him who does not worship Him.  </p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; Of Man, and the Brute Animals, and Religion.</h2>

<p>Though <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have often turned aside from reason through their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and have fallen into inextricable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> (for that is wont to happen to these which happens to a traveller <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the way, and not confessing that he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>&mdash;namely, that he wanders about, while he is ashamed to inquire from those whom he meets), no <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, however, has ever made the assertion that there is no difference between man and the brutes. Nor has any one at all, provided that he wished to appear wise, reduced a rational animal to the level of the mute and irrational; which some <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> do, resembling the brutes themselves, who, wishing to give themselves up to the indulgence of their appetite and pleasure, say that they are born on the same principle as all living animals, which it is impious for man to say. For who is so unlearned as not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, who is so void of understanding as not to perceive, that there is something divine in man? I do not as yet come to the excellences of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, by which there is a manifest affinity between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Does not the position of the body itself, and the fashion of the countenance, declare that we are not on a level with the dumb creation? Their nature is prostrated to the ground and to their pasture, and has nothing in common with the heaven, which they do not look upon. But man, with his erect position, with his elevated countenance raised to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, compares his features with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and reason recognises reason.  </p>

<p>And on this account there is no animal, as Cicero says,  except man, which has any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For he alone is furnished with wisdom, so that he alone understands religion; and this is the chief or only difference between man and the dumb animals. For the other things which appear to be peculiar to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, even if there are not such in the dumb animals, nevertheless may appear to be similar. Speech is peculiar to man; yet even in these there is a certain resemblance to speech. For they both distinguish one another by their voices; and when they are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, they send forth a sound resembling altercation; and when they see one another after an interval of time, they show the office of congratulation by their voice. To us, indeed, their voices appear uncouth,  as ours perhaps do to them; but to themselves, who understand one another, they are words. In short, in every affection they utter distinct expressions of voice  by which they may show their state of mind. Laughter also is peculiar to man; and yet we see certain indications of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in other animals, when they use passionate gestures  with a view to sports, hang down  their ears, contract their mouth, smooth their forehead, relax their eyes to sportiveness. What is so peculiar to man as reason and the foreseeing of the future? But there are animals which open several outlets in different directions from their lairs, that if any danger comes upon them, an escape may be open for them shut in; but they would not do this unless they possessed intelligence and reflection. Others are provident for the future, as </p> <blockquote><p><q>Ants, when they plunder a great heap of grain, mindful of the winter, and lay it up in their dwelling;</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>again&mdash;</p> <blockquote><p><q>As bees, which alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a country and fixed abodes; and mindful of the winter which is to come, they practice labour in the summer, and lay up their gains as a common stock.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>It would be a long task if I should wish to trace out the things most resembling the skill of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which are accustomed to be done by the separate tribes of animals. But if, in the case of all these things which are wont to be ascribed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, there is found to be some resemblance even in the dumb animals, it is evident that religion is the only thing of which no trace can be found in the dumb animals, nor any indication. For <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is peculiar to religion, and to this no other animal attains. For man alone bears rule; the other animals are subjected  to him. But the worship of God is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; and he who does not embrace this, being far removed from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, will live the life of the brutes under the form of man. But since we differ from the other animals almost in this respect alone, that we alone of all perceive the divine might and power, while in the others there is no understanding of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is surely impossible that in this respect either the dumb animals should have more wisdom, or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> should be unwise, since all living creatures, and the whole system of nature, are subject to man on account of his wisdom. Wherefore if reason, if the force of man in this respect, excels and surpasses the rest of living creatures, inasmuch as he alone is capable of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is evident that religion can in no way be overthrown. </p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; Of Religion.</h2>

<p>But religion is overthrown if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> speaking thus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of gods must ever in itself of necessity enjoy <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> together with supreme repose, far removed and withdrawn from our concerns; since, exempt from every pain, exempt from all dangers, strong in its own resources, not wanting anything of us, it is neither gained by favours nor moved by <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Now, when he says these things, does he think that any worship is to be paid to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or does he entirely overthrow religion? For if God confers nothing good on any one, if He repays the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of His worshipper with no favour, what is so senseless, what so foolish, as to build temples, to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, to present gifts, to diminish our property, that we may obtain nothing?  But (it will be said) it is right that an excellent nature should be honoured. What <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> can be due to a being who pays no regard to us, and is ungrateful? Can we be bound in any manner to him who has nothing in common with us? <q>Farewell to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> says Cicero,  <q>if He is such as to be influenced by no favour, and by no affection of men. For why should I say 'may He be propitious? ' for He can be propitious to no one.</q> What can be spoken more contemptible with respect to God? Farewell to Him, he says, that is, let Him depart and retire, since He is able to profit no one. But if God takes no trouble, nor occasions trouble to another, why then should we not commit crimes as often as it shall be in our power to escape the notice of men  and to cheat the public <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>? Wherever we shall obtain a favourable opportunity of escaping notice, let us take advantage of the occasion: let us take away the property of others, either without bloodshed or even with blood, if there is nothing else besides the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to be reverenced. </p>

<p>While <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> entertains these sentiments, he altogether destroys religion; and when this is taken away, confusion and perturbation of life will follow. But if religion cannot be taken away without destroying our hold of wisdom, by which we are separated from the brutes, and of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, by which the public life may be more secure, how can religion itself be maintained or guarded without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? For that which is not feared is despised, and that which is despised is plainly not reverenced. Thus it comes to pass that religion, and majesty, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> exist together with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; but there is no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> where no one is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. Whether, therefore, you take away from God kindness, or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, or both, religion must be taken away, without which the life of men is full of folly, of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and enormity. For <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> greatly curbs men, if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we are living in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; if we <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> not only that the actions which we perform are seen from above, but also that our thoughts and our words are heard by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it is profitable to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this, as some <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, not for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but of utility, since <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> cannot punish <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> unless some terror from above hangs over to restrain offenses. Therefore religion is altogether false, and there is no divinity; but all things are made up by skilful men, in order that they may live more uprightly and innocently. This is a great question, and foreign to the subject which we have proposed; but because it necessarily occurs, it ought to be handled, however briefly. </p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; Of the Providence of God, and of Opinions Opposed to It.</h2>

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of former times had agreed in their opinions respecting <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, and there was no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that the world was set in order by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and reason, and was governed by reason, Protagoras, in the times of Socrates, was the first of all who said that it was not clear to him whether there was any divinity or not. And this disputation of his was judged so impious, and so contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and to religion, that the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> both banished him from their territories, and burnt in a public assembly those books of his in which these statements were contained. But there is no need to speak respecting his opinions, because he pronounced nothing certain. After these things Socrates and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and those who flowed forth from the school of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> like rivulets into different directions, namely, the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> and Peripatetics, were of the same opinion as those who went before them.  </p>

<p>Afterwards <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> said that there was indeed a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because it was necessary that there should be in the world some being of surpassing excellence, distinction, and blessedness; yet that there was no <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, and thus that the world itself was ordered by no plan, nor art, nor workmanship, but that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> was made up of certain minute and indivisible seeds. But I do not see what can be said more repugnant to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For if there is a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as God He is manifestly provident; nor can divinity be attributed to Him in any other way than if He retains the past, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the present, and foresees the future. Therefore, in taking away <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, he also denied the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>. But when he openly acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, at the same time he also admitted His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> for the one cannot exist at all, or be understood, without the other. But in those later times in which <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> had now lost its vigour  there lived a certain Diagoras of Melos,  who altogether denied the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and on account of this sentiment was called atheist;  also Theodorus  of Cyrene: both of whom, because they were unable to discover anything new, all things having already been said and found out, preferred even, in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to deny that in which all preceding <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> had agreed without any ambiguity. These are they who attacked <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, which had been asserted and defended through so many ages by so many intellects. What then? Shall we refute those trifling and inactive <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> by reason, or by the authority of distinguished men, or rather by both? But we must hasten onwards, lest our speech should wander too far from our subject. </p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; Of the Origin of the World, and the Nature of Affairs, and the Providence of God.</h2>

<p>They who do not admit that the world was made by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>, either say that it is composed of first principles coming together at random, or that it suddenly came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by nature, but hold, as Straton  does, that nature has in itself the power of production and of diminution, but that it has neither sensibility nor figure, so that we may understand that all things were produced spontaneously, without any artificer or author. Each opinion is vain and impossible. But this happens to those who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that they devise anything, rather than perceive that which the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the subject  requires. First of all, with respect to those minute seeds, by the meeting together of which they say that the whole world came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>,  I ask where or whence they are. Who has seen them at any time? Who has perceived them? Who has heard them? Had none but Leucippus  eyes? Had he alone a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, who assuredly alone of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> was blind and senseless, since he spoke those things which no sick man could have uttered in his ravings,  or one asleep in his dreams? </p>

<p>The ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> argued that all things were made up of four elements.  He would not admit this, lest he should appear to tread in the footsteps of others; but he held that there were other first principles of the elements themselves, which can neither be seen, nor touched, nor be perceived by any part of the body. They are so minute, he says, that there is no edge of a sword so fine that they can be cut and divided by it. From which circumstance he gave them the name of atoms. But it occurred to him, that if they all had one and the same nature, they could not make up different objects of so great a variety as we see to be present in the world. He said, therefore, that there were smooth and rough ones, and round, and angular, and hooked. How much better had it been to be silent, than to have a tongue for such miserable and empty uses! And, indeed, I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest he who thinks these things worthy of refutation, should appear no less to rave. Let us, however, reply as to one who says something.  If they are soft  and round, it is plain that they cannot lay hold of one another, so as to make some body; as, though any one should wish to bind together millet into one combination,  the very softness of the grains would not permit them to come together into a mass. If they are rough, and angular, and hooked, so that they may be able to cohere, then they are divisible, and capable of being cut; for hooks and angles must project,  so that they may possibly be cut off. </p>

<p>Therefore that which is able to be cut off and torn away, will be able both to be seen and held. <q>These,</q> he says, <q>flutter about with restless motions through empty space, and are carried hither and there, just as we see little particles of dust in the sun when it has introduced its rays and light through a window. From these there arise trees and herbs, and all fruits of the earth; from these, animals, and water, and fire, and all things are produced, and are again resolved into the same elements.</q> This can be borne as long as the inquiry is respecting small matters. Even the world itself was made up of these. He has reached to the full extent of perfect <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>: it seems impossible that anything further should be said, and yet he found something to add. <q>Since everything,</q> he says, <q>is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, and nothing can be empty, it follows of necessity that there are innumerable worlds.</q> What force of atoms had been so great, that masses so incalculable should be collected from such minute elements? And first of all I ask, What is the nature or origin of those seeds? For if all things are from them, whence shall we say that they themselves are? What nature supplied such an abundance of matter for the making of innumerable worlds? But let us grant that he raved with impunity concerning worlds; let us speak respecting this in which we are, and which we see. He says that all things are made from minute bodies which are incapable of division. </p>

<p>If this were so, no object would ever need the seed of its own kind. Birds would be born without eggs, or eggs without bringing forth; likewise the rest of the living creatures without coition: trees and the productions of the earth would not have their own seeds, which we daily handle and sow. Why does a grain-field arise from grain, and again grain from a grain-field? In short, if the meeting together and collecting of atoms would effect all things, all things would grow together in the air, since atoms flutter about through empty space. Why cannot the herb, why cannot the tree or grain, arise or be increased without earth, without roots, without moisture, without seed? From which it is evident that nothing is made up from atoms, since everything has its own peculiar and fixed nature, its own seed, its own law given from the beginning. Finally, Lucretius, as though forgetful of atoms,  which he was maintaining, in order that he might refute those who say that all things are produced from nothing, employed these arguments, which might have weighed against himself. For he thus spoke:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>If things came from nothing, any kind might be born of anything; nothing would require seed.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Likewise afterwards:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>We must admit, therefore, that nothing can come from nothing, since things require seed before they can severally be born, and be brought out into the buxom fields of air.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Who would <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that he had brain when he said these things, and did not see that they were contrary to one another? For that nothing is made by means of atoms, is apparent from this, that everything has a definite  seed, unless by chance we shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the nature both of fire and water is derived from atoms. Why should I say, that if materials of the greatest hardness are struck together with a violent blow, fire is struck out? Are atoms concealed in the steel, or in the flint? Who shut them in? Or why do they not leap forth spontaneously? Or how could the seeds of fire remain in a material of the greatest coldness? </p>

<p>I leave the subject of the flint and steel. If you hold in the sun an orb of crystal filled with water, fire is kindled from the light which is reflected from the water, even in the most severe cold. Must we then <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that fire is contained in the water? And yet fire cannot be kindled from the sun even in summer. If you shall breathe upon wax, or if a light vapour shall touch anything&mdash; either the hard surface  of marble or a plate of metal&mdash; water is gradually condensed by means of the most minute drops. Also from the exhalation of the earth or sea mist is formed, which either, being dispersed, moistens whatever it has covered, or being collected, is carried aloft by the wind to high mountains, and compressed into cloud, and sends down great rains. Where, then, do we say that fluids are produced? Is it in the vapour? Or in the exhalation? Or in the wind? But nothing can be formed in that which is neither touched nor seen. Why should I speak of animals, in whose bodies we see nothing formed without plan, without arrangement, without utility, without beauty, so that the most skilful and careful marking out  of all the parts and members repels the idea of accident and chance? But let us suppose it possible that the limbs, and bones, and nerves, and blood should be made up of atoms. What of the senses, the reflection, the memory, the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the natural capacity: from what seeds can they be compacted?  He says, From the most minute. There are therefore others of greater size. How, then, are they indivisible? </p>

<p>In the next place, if the things which are not seen are formed from invisible seeds, it follows that those which are seen are from visible seeds. Why, then, does no one see them? But whether any one regards the invisible parts which are in man, or the parts which can be touched, and which are visible, who does not see that both parts exist in accordance with design?  How, then, can bodies which meet together without design effect anything reasonable?  For we see that there is nothing in the whole world which has not in itself very great and wonderful design. And since this is above the sense and capacity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to what can it be more rightly attributed than to the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>? If a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, the resemblance of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is made by the exercise of design and art, shall we suppose that man himself is made up of fragments which come together at random? And what resemblance to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is there in the thing produced,  when the greatest and most surpassing skill  can imitate nothing more than the mere outline and extreme lineaments  of the body? Was the skill of man able to give to his production any motion or sensibility? I say nothing of the exercise of the sight, of hearing, and of smelling, and the wonderful uses of the other members, either those which are in sight or those which are hidden from view. What artificer could have fabricated either the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or the voice, or his very wisdom? Does any man of sound <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, therefore, think that that which man cannot do by reason and judgment, may be accomplished by a meeting together of atoms everywhere adhering to each other? You see into what foolish ravings they have fallen, while they are unwilling to assign to God the making and the care of all things </p>

<p>Let us, however, concede to them that the things which are earthly are made from atoms: are the things also which are heavenly? They say that the gods are without contamination, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and blessed; and they grant to them alone an exemption, so that they do not appear to be made up of a meeting together of atoms. For if the gods also had been made up of these, they would be liable to be dispersed, the seeds at length being resolved, and returning to their own nature. Therefore, if there is something which the atoms could not produce, why may we not judge in the same way of the others? But I ask why the gods did not build for themselves a dwelling-place before those first elements produced the world? It is manifest that, unless the atoms had come together and made the heaven, the gods would still be suspended through the midst of empty space. By what counsel, then, by what plan, did the atoms from a confused mass collect themselves, so that from some the earth below was formed into a globe, and the heaven stretched out above, adorned with so great a variety of constellations that nothing can be conceived more embellished? Can he, therefore, who sees such and so great objects, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they were made without any design, without any <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, without any divine intelligence, but that such great and wonderful things arose out of fine and minute atoms? Does it not resemble a prodigy, that there should be any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being who might say these things, or that there should be those who might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them&mdash; as Democritus, who was his hearer, or <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, to whom all folly flowed forth from the fountain of Leucippus? But, as others say, the world was made by Nature, which is without perception and figure.  But this is much more absurd. If Nature made the world, it must have made it by judgment and intelligence; for it is he that makes something who has either the inclination to make it, or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. If nature is without perception and figure, how can that be made by it which has both perception and figure, unless by chance any one thinks that the fabric of animals, which is so delicate, could have been formed and animated by that which is without perception, or that that figure of heaven, which is prepared with such foresight for the uses of living beings, suddenly came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by some accident or other, without a builder, without an artificer?  </p>

<p><q>If there is anything,</q> says Chrysippus, <q>which effects those things which man, though he is endowed with reason, cannot do, that assuredly is greater, and stronger, and wiser than man.</q> But man cannot make heavenly things; therefore that which shall produce or has produced these things surpasses man in art, in design, in skill, and in power. Who, therefore, can it be but God? But Nature, which they suppose to be, as it were, the mother of all things, if it has not a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, will effect nothing, will contrive nothing; for where there is no reflection there is neither motion nor efficacy. But if it uses counsel for the commencement of anything, reason for its arrangement, art for its accomplishment, energy for its consummation, and power to govern and control, why should it be called Nature rather than God? Or if a concourse of atoms, or Nature without <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, made those things which we see, I ask why it was able to make the heaven, but unable to make a city or a house?  Why it made mountains of marble, but did not make columns and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>? But ought not atoms to have come together to effect these things, since they leave no position untried? For concerning Nature, which has no <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, it is no wonder that it forgot to do these things. What, then, is the case? It is plain that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He commenced this work of the world&mdash;than which nothing can be better arranged with respect to order, nor more befitting as to utility, nor more adorned as to beauty, nor greater as to bulk&mdash;Himself made the things which could not be made by man; and among these also man himself, to whom He gave a portion of His own wisdom, and furnished him with reason, as much as earthly frailty was capable of receiving, that he might make for himself the things which were necessary for his own uses. </p>

<p>But if in the commonwealth of this world, so to speak, there is no <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> which rules, no God who administers, no sense at all prevails in this nature of things. From what source therefore will it be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, with its skill and its intelligence, had its origin? For if the body of man was made from the ground, from which circumstance man received his name;  it follows that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which has intelligence, and is the ruler of the body, which the limbs <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> as a king and commander, which can neither be looked upon nor comprehended, could not have come to man except from a wise nature. But as mind and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> govern everybody, so also does God govern the world. For it is not probable that lesser and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> things bear rule, but that greater and highest things do not bear rule. In short, Marcus Cicero, in his <em>Tusculan Disputations</em>,  and in his <em>Consolation</em>, says: <q>No origin of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> can be found on earth. For there is nothing, he says, mixed and compound  in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, or which may appear to be produced and made up from the earth; nothing moist or airy,  or of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of fire. For in these natures there is nothing which has the force of memory, of mind and reflection, which both retains the past and foresees the future, and is able to comprise the present; which things alone are divine. For no source will ever be found from which they are able to come to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, unless it be from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Since, therefore, with the exception of two or three vain <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a>, it is agreed upon that the world is governed by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, as also it was made, and there is no one who ventures to prefer the opinion of Diagoras and Theodorus, or the empty fiction of Leucippus, or the levity of Democritus and <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, either to the authority of those seven ancient men who were called wise,  or to that of Pythagoras or of Socrates or <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and the other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who judged that there is a <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>; therefore that opinion also is false, by which they think that religion was instituted by wise men for the sake of terror and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, in order that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> men might abstain from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. </p>

<p>But if this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it follows that we are derided by the wise men of old. But if they invented religion for the sake of deceiving us, and moreover of deceiving the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, therefore they were not wise, because <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> is not consistent with the character of the wise man. But grant that they were wise; what great success in <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> was it, that they were able to deceive not only the unlearned, but <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> also, and Socrates, and so easily to delude Pythagoras, Zeno, and Aristotle, the chiefs of the greatest <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>? There is therefore a <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>, as those men whom I have named perceived, by the energy and power of which all things which we see were both made and are governed. For so vast a system of things  such arrangement and such regularity in preserving the settled orders and times, could neither at first have arisen without a provident artificer, or have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> so many ages without a powerful inhabitant, or have been perpetually governed without a skilful and intelligent  ruler; and reason itself declares this. For whatever exists which has reason, must have arisen from reason. Now reason is the part of an intelligent and wise nature; but a wise and intelligent nature can be nothing else than God. Now the world, since it has reason, by which it is both governed and kept together, was therefore made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if God is the maker and ruler of the world, then religion is rightly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> established; for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and worship are due to the author and common parent of all things. </p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; Of God, and that the One God, and by Whose Providence the World is Governed and Exists.</h2>

<p>Since it is agreed upon concerning <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, it follows that we show whether it is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that it belongs to many, or rather to one only. We have sufficiently taught, as I think, in our <em>Institutions</em>, that there cannot be many gods; because, if the divine energy and power be distributed among several, it must necessarily be diminished. But that which is lessened is plainly mortal; but if He is not mortal, He can neither be lessened nor divided. Therefore there is but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whom complete energy and power can neither be lessened nor increased. But if there are many, while they separately have something of power and authority, the sum itself decreases; nor will they separately be able to have the whole, which they have in common with others: so much will be wanting to each as the others shall possess. There cannot therefore be many rulers in this world, nor many masters in one house, nor many pilots in one ship, nor many leaders in one herd or flock, nor many queens in one swarm. But there could not have been many suns in heaven, as there are not several <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in one body; so entirely does the whole of nature agree in unity. But if the world </p> <blockquote><p><q>Is nourished by a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <br>A spirit whose celestial flame <br>Glows in each member of the frame, <br>And stirs the mighty whole,</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>it is evident from the testimony of the poet, that there is one God who inhabits the world, since the whole body cannot be inhabited and governed except by one mind. Therefore all divine power must be in one person, by whose will and command all things are ruled; and therefore He is so great, that He cannot be described in words by man, or estimated by the senses. From what source, therefore, did the opinion or persuasion  respecting many gods come to men? Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, all those who are worshipped as gods were men, and were also the earliest and greatest kings; but who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that they were invested with divine honours after death, either on account of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by which they had profited the race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or that they obtained <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> memory on account of the benefits and inventions by which they had adorned <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life? And not only men, but <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also. And this, both the most ancient writers of Greece, whom they call <span style="italic">theologi</span>;  and also Roman writers following and imitating the Greeks, teach; of whom especially Euhemerus and our Ennius, who point out the birthdays, marriages, offspring, governments, exploits, deaths, and tombs  of all of them. And Tullius, following them, in his third book, <em>On the Nature of the Gods</em>, destroyed the public <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a>; but neither he himself nor any other person was able to introduce the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one, of which he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. And thus he himself testified that that which was false was evident; that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, however, lay concealed. <q>Would to heaven,</q> he says, <q>that I could as easily discover <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> things as refute those that are false!</q>  And this he proclaimed not with dissimulation as an Academic, but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and in accordance with the feeling of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> cannot be uprooted from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> perceptions: that which the foresight of man was able to attain to, he attained to, that he might expose false things. For whatever is fictitious and false, because it is supported by no reason, is easily destroyed. There is therefore one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the source and origin of all things, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> both felt and taught in the <em>Tim&oelig;us</em>, whose majesty he declares to be so great, that it can neither be comprehended by the mind nor be expressed by the tongue. </p>

<p>Hermes bears the same testimony, whom Cicero asserts  to be reckoned by the Egyptians among the number of the gods. I speak of him who, on account of his excellence and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of many arts, was called Trismegistus; and he was far more ancient not only than <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, but than Pythagoras, and those seven wise men.  In Xenophon,  Socrates, as he discourses, says that the form of God ought not to be inquired about: and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, in his <em>Book of Laws</em>,  says: <q>What God is, ought not to be the subject of inquiry, because it can neither be found out nor related.</q> Pythagoras also admits that there is but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying that there is an incorporeal <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which, being diffused and stretched through all nature, gives vital perception to all living creatures; but Antisthenes, in his <span style="italic">Physics</span>, said that there was but one natural <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although the nations and cities have gods of their own people. Aristotle, with his followers the Peripatetics, and Zeno with his followers the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, say nearly the same things. Truly it would be a long task to follow up the opinions of all separately, who, although they used different names, nevertheless agreed in one power which governed the world. But, however, though <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and poets, and those, in short, who worship the gods, often acknowledge the Supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet no one ever inquired into, no one discussed, the subject of His worship and honours; with that persuasion, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, with which, always believing Him to be bounteous and incorruptible, they think  that He is neither <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with any one, nor stands in need of any worship. Thus there can be no religion where there is no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.  </p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; Of Religion and the Fear of God.</h2>

<p>Now, since we have replied to the impious and detestable wisdom,  or rather senselessness of some, let us return to our proposed subject. We have said that, if religion is taken away, neither wisdom nor <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> can be retained: wisdom, because the understanding of the divine nature, in which we differ from the brutes, is found in man alone; <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, because unless <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who cannot be deceived, shall restrain our desires, we shall live wickedly and impiously. Therefore, that our actions should be viewed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, pertains not only to the usefulness of common life, but even to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; because, if religion and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> are taken away, having lost our reason, we either descend to the senselessness  of the herds; or to the savageness of the beasts, yea, even more so, since the beasts spare animals of their own kind. What will be more savage, what more unmerciful, than man, if, the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of a superior being taken away, he shall be able either to escape the notice of or to despise the might of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>? It is therefore the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God alone which guards the mutual society of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, by which life itself is sustained, protected, and governed. But that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is taken away if man is persuaded that God is without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; for that He is moved and indignant when <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> actions are done, not only the common advantage, but even reason itself, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, persuade us. We must again return to the former subjects, that, as we have taught that the world was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we may teach why it was made. </p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; Of the Advantage and Use of the World and of the Seasons.</h2>

<p>If any one considers the whole government of the world, he will certainly understand how <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, who say that the world was made on our account. For all the things of which the world is composed, and which it produces from itself, are adapted to the use of man. Man, accordingly, uses fire for the purpose of warmth and light, and of softening his food, and for the working of iron; he uses springs for drinking, and for baths; he uses rivers for irrigating the fields, and assigning boundaries to countries; he uses the earth for receiving a variety of fruits, the hills for planting vineyards, the mountains for the use of trees and firewood,  the plains for crops of grain; he uses the sea not only for commerce, and for receiving supplies from distant countries, but also for abundance of every kind of fish. But if he makes use of these elements to which he is nearest, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he uses the heaven also, since the offices even of heavenly things are regulated for the fertility of the earth from which we live. The sun, with its ceaseless courses and unequal intervals,  completes its annual circles, and either at his rising draws forth the day for labour, or at his setting brings on the night for repose; and at one time by his departure farther towards the south, at another time by his approach nearer towards the north, he causes the vicissitudes of winter and summer, so that both by the moistures and frosts of winter the earth becomes enriched for fruitfulness, and by the heats of summer either the produce of grass  is hardened by maturity, or that which is in moist places, being seethed and heated, becomes ripened. The moon also, which governs the time of night, regulates her monthly courses by the alternate loss and recovery of light,  and by the brightness of her shining illumines the nights obscure with gloomy darkness, so that journeys in the summer heat, and expeditions, and works, may be performed without labour and inconvenience; since </p> <blockquote><p><q>By night the light stubble, by night <br>The dry meadows are better mown.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>The other heavenly bodies also, either at their rising or setting, supply favourable times  by their fixed positions.  Moreover, they also afford guidance to ships, that they may not wander through the boundless deep with uncertain course, since the pilot duly observing them arrives at the harbour of the shore at which he aims.  Clouds are attracted by the breath of the winds, that the fields of sown grain may be watered with showers, that the vines may abound with produce, and the trees with fruits. And these things are exhibited by a succession of changes throughout the year, that nothing may at any time be wanting by which the life of men is sustained. But  (it is said) the same earth nourishes the other living creatures, and by the produce of the same even the dumb animals are fed. Has not God laboured also for the sake of the dumb animals? By no means; because they are void of reason. On the contrary, we understand that even these themselves in the same manner were made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the use of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, partly for food, partly for clothing, partly to assist him in his work; so that it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> wished to furnish and adorn the life of men with an abundance of objects and resources, and on this account He both filled the air with birds, and the sea with fishes, and the earth with quadrupeds. But the Academics, arguing against the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, are accustomed to ask why, if God made all things for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, many things are found even opposed, and hostile, and injurious to us, as well in the sea as on the land. And the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, without any regard to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, most foolishly repelled this. For they say that there are many things among natural productions,  and reckoned among animals, the utility of which hitherto  escapes notice, but that this is discovered in process of the times, as necessity and use have already discovered many things which were unknown in former ages. What utility, then, can be discovered in mice, in beetles, in serpents, which are troublesome and pernicious to man? Is it that some medicine lies concealed in them? If there is any, it will at some time be found out, namely, as a remedy against <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, whereas they complain that it is altogether <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. They say that the viper, when burnt and reduced to ashes, is a remedy for the bite of the same beast. How much better had it been that it should not exist at all, than that a remedy should be required against it drawn from itself? </p>

<p>They might then have answered with more conciseness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> after this manner. When God had formed man as it were His own image, that which was the completion of His workmanship, He breathed wisdom into him alone, so that he might bring all things into subjection to his own authority and government, and make use of all the advantages of the world. And yet He set before him both good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, inasmuch as He gave to him wisdom, the whole nature of which is employed in discerning things <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and good: for no one can choose better things, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, unless he at the same time <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to reject and avoid the things which are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.  They are both mutually connected with each other, so that, the one being taken away, the other must also be taken away. Therefore, good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things being set before it, then at length wisdom discharges its office, and desires the good for usefulness, but rejects the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for safety. Therefore, as innumerable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things have been given which it might enjoy, so also have <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, against which it might guard. For if there is no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, no danger&mdash; nothing, in short, which can injure man&mdash; all the material of wisdom is taken away, and will be unnecessary for man. For if only <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things are placed in sight, what need is there of reflection, of understanding, of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, of reason? Since, wherever he shall extend his hand, that is befitting and adapted to nature; so that if any one should wish to place a most exquisite dinner before infants, who as yet have no taste, it is plain that each will desire that to which either impulse, or hunger, or even accident, shall attract them; and whatever they shall take, it will be useful and salutary to them. What injury will it therefore be for them always to remain as they are, and always to be infants and unacquainted with affairs? But if you add a mixture either of bitter things, or things useless, or even poisonous, they are plainly deceived through their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, unless wisdom is added to them, by which they may have the rejection of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things and the choice of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. </p>

<p>You see, therefore, that we have greater need of wisdom on account of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; and unless these things had been proposed to us, we should not be a rational animal. But if this account is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> were in no manner able to see, that argument also of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> is done away. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he says, either wishes to take away <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and is unable; or He is able, and is unwilling; or He is neither willing nor able, or He is both willing and able. If He is willing and is unable, He is feeble, which is not in accordance with the character of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; if He is able and unwilling, He is <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, which is equally at variance with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; if He is neither willing nor able, He is both <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> and feeble, and therefore not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; if He is both willing and able, which alone is suitable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from what source then are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>? Or why does He not remove them? I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that many of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who defend <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, are accustomed to be disturbed by this argument, and are almost driven against their will to admit that God takes no interest in anything, which <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> especially aims at; but having examined the matter, we easily do away with this formidable argument. For God is able to do whatever He wishes, and there is no weakness or <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He is able, therefore, to take away <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; but He does not wish to do so, and yet He is not on that account <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>. For on this account He does not take them away, because He at the same time gives wisdom, as I have shown; and there is more of goodness and pleasure in wisdom than of annoyance in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. For wisdom causes us even to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to attain to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, which is the chief good. Therefore, unless we first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, we shall be unable to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> good. But <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> did not see this, nor did any other, that if <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are taken away, wisdom is in like manner taken away; and that no traces of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> remain in man, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of which consists in enduring and overcoming the bitterness of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. And thus, for the sake of a slight gain  in the taking away of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, we should be deprived of a good, which is very great, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and peculiar to us. It is plain, therefore, that all things are proposed for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as well <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> as also goods. </p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; Why God Made Man.</h2>

<p>It follows that I show for what purpose God made man himself. As He contrived the world for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so He formed man himself on His own account, as it were a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of a divine temple, a spectator of His works and of heavenly objects. For he is the only being who, since he is intelligent and capable of reason, is able to understand <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to admire His works, and perceive His energy and power; for on this account he is furnished with judgment, intelligence, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. On this account he alone, beyond the other living creatures, has been made with an upright body and attitude, so that he seems to have been raised up for the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of his Parent.  On this account he alone has received language, and a tongue the interpreter of his thought, that he may be able to declare the majesty of his Lord. Lastly, for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> all things were placed under his control, that he himself might be under the control of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, their Maker and Creator. If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, designed man to be a worshipper of Himself, and on this account gave him so much <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, that he might rule over all things; it is plainly most just that he should worship Him  who bestowed upon him such great gifts, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> man, who is united with us in the participation of the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">divine justice</a>. For it is not right that a worshipper of God should he injured by a worshipper of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. From which it is understood that man was made for the sake of religion and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. And of this matter Marcus Tullius is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in his books respecting the Laws, since he thus speaks:  <q>But of all things concerning which learned men dispute, nothing is of greater consequence than that it should be altogether understood that we are born to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</q> And if this is most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it follows that God will have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be just, that is, to have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> as objects of their affection; to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> God in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as a Father, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> man as a brother: for in these two things the whole of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is comprised. But he who either fails to acknowledge God or acts injuriously to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, lives <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> and contrary to his nature, and in this manner disturbs the divine institution and law. </p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; Whence Sins Extended to Man.</h2>

<p>Here perhaps some one may ask, Whence <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> extended to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or what perversion distorted the rule of the divine institution to worse things, so that, though he was born to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, he nevertheless performs <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> works. I have already in a former place explained, that God at the same time set before him good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that He loves the good, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is contrary to this; but that He permitted the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> on this account, that the good also might shine forth, since, as I have often taught, we understand that the one cannot exist without the other; in short, that the world itself is made up of two elements opposing and connected with one another, of fire and moisture, and that light could not have been made unless there has also been darkness, since there cannot be a higher place without a lower, nor a rising without a setting, nor warmth without cold, nor softness without hardness. Thus also we are composed of two substances equally opposed to one another&mdash; <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body: the one of which is assigned to the heaven, because it is slight and not to be handled; the other to the earth, because it is capable of being laid hold of: the one is firm  and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, the other frail and mortal. Therefore good clings to the one, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to the other: light, life, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the one; darkness, death, and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to the other. Hence there arose among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the corruption of their nature, so that it was necessary that a law should be established, by which <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> might be prohibited, and the duties of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> be enjoined. Since, therefore, there are good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things in the affairs of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of which I have set forth, it must be that God is moved to both sides, both to favour when He sees that just things are done, and to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> when He perceives <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> things. </p>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> opposes us, and says: <q>If there is in God the affection of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> leading Him to favour, and of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> influencing Him to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, He must of necessity have both <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and inclination, and desire, and the other affections which belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness.</q> It does not follow that he who is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> must <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, or that he who feels <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> must grieve; in short, they who are liable to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> are less timid, and they who are of a joyful temperament are less affected with grief. What need is there to speak of the affections of humanity, to which our nature yields? Let us weigh the divine necessity; for I am unwilling to speak of nature, since it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that our God was never born. The affection of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> has a subject-matter in man, but it has none in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Man, inasmuch as he is liable to many accidents and dangers, fears lest any greater <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> should arise which may strike, despoil, lacerate, dash down, and destroy him. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is liable neither to want, nor injury, nor pain, nor death, can by no means <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, because there is nothing which can offer <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to Him. Also the reason and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of desire is manifest in man. For, inasmuch as he was made frail and mortal, it was necessary that another and different sex should be made, by union with which offspring might be produced to continue the perpetuity of his race. But this desire has no place in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because frailty and death are far removed from Him; nor is there with Him any female in whose union He is able to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>; nor does He stand in need of succession, since He will live for ever. The same things may be said respecting <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and passion, to which, from sure and manifest causes, man is liable, but to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is by no means liable. But, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, favour and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and pity have their substance  in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that greatest and matchless power employs them for the preservation of the world. </p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; Of God, and His Anger and Affections.</h2>

<p>Some one will ask what this substance is. First of all, when <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> befall them, men in their dejected state for the most part have recourse to God: they appease and entreat Him, believing that He is able to repel injuries from them. He has therefore an occasion of exercising pity; for He is not so unmerciful and a despiser of men as to refuse aid to those who are in distress. Very many, also, who are persuaded that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both worship Him who is Lord and Parent of all, and with continual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and repeated vows offer gifts and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, follow up His name with praises, striving to gain His favour by just and good works. There is therefore a reason, on account of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may and ought to favour them. For if there is nothing so befitting God as beneficence, and nothing so unsuited to His character as to be ungrateful, it is necessary that He should make some return for the services of those who are excellent, and who lead a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life, that He may not be liable to the charge of ingratitude which is worthy of blame  even in the case of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But, on the contrary, others are daring  and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, who pollute all things with their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, harass with slaughters, practice fraud, plunder, commit <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, neither spare <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> nor <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, neglect the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and even God Himself. Anger, therefore, has a befitting occasion  in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<p>For it is not right that, when He sees such things, He should not be moved, and arise to take vengeance upon the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and destroy the pestilent and guilty, so as to promote the interests of all good men. Thus even in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> itself there is also contained a showing of kindness.  Therefore the arguments are found to be empty and false, either of those who, when they will not admit that God is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, will have it that He shows kindness, because this, indeed, cannot take place without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; or of those who think that there is no emotion of the mind in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And because there are some affections to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not liable, as desire, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, grief, and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, they have said that He is entirely free from all affection. For He is not liable to these, because they are vicious affections; but as to those which belong to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>&mdash;that is, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, regard towards the good, pity towards the afflicted&mdash;inasmuch as they are worthy of the divine power, He has affections of His own,  both just and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. And if He is not possessed of them, the life of man will be thrown into confusion, and the condition of things will come to such disturbance that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> will be despised and overpowered, and audacity alone reign, so that no one can at length be in safety unless he who excels  in strength. Thus all the earth will be laid waste, as it were, by a common <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>. But now, since the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> expect punishment, and the good hope for favour, and the afflicted look for aid, there is place for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and crimes are more rare. But  it is said, ofttimes the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are more prosperous, and the good more wretched, and the just are harassed with impunity by the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. We will hereafter consider why these things happen. In the meantime let us explain respecting <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, whether there be any in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whether He takes no notice at all, and is unmoved at those things which are done with impiety. </p>

<h2>Chapter 17.&mdash; Of God, His Care and Anger.</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, says <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, regards nothing; therefore He has no power. For he who has power must of necessity regard affairs. For if He has power, and does not use it, what so great <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is there that, I will not say our race, but even the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> itself, should be contemptible in His sight? On this account he says He is pure  and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, because He is always at rest.  To whom, then, has the administration of so great affairs been entrusted,  if these things which we see to be governed by the highest judgment are neglected by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? Or how can he who lives and perceives be at rest? For rest belongs either to sleep or to death. But sleep has not rest. For when we are asleep, the body indeed is at rest, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is restless and agitated: it forms for itself images which it may behold, so that it exercises its natural power of motion by a variety of visions, and calls itself away from false things, until the limbs are satiated, and receive vigour from rest. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rest belongs to death alone. Now if death does not affect <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows that God is never at rest. But in what can the action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> consist, but in the administration of the world? But if God carries on the care of the world, it follows that He cares for the life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and takes notice of the acts of individuals, and He earnestly desires that they should be wise and good. This is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this the divine law; and he who follows and observes this is beloved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is necessary that He should be moved with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against the man who has broken or despised this <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and divine law. If, he says, God does harm to any one, therefore He is not good. They are deceived by no slight <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> who defame all censure, whether <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> or divine, with the name of bitterness and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, thinking that He ought to be called injurious  who visits the injurious with punishment. But if this is so, it follows that we have injurious <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, which enact punishment for offenders, and injurious judges who inflict capital punishments on those convicted of crime. But if the law is just which awards to the transgressor his due, and if the judge is called upright and good when he punishes crimes&mdash;for he guards the safety of good men who punishes the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>&mdash;it follows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He opposes the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is not injurious; but he himself is injurious who either injures an innocent man, or spares an injurious person that he may injure many. </p>

<p>I would gladly ask from those who represent God as immoveable,  if any one had property, a house, a household  of slaves, and his slaves, despising the forbearance of their master, should attack all things, and themselves take the enjoyment of his goods, if his household should <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> them, while the master was despised by all, insulted, and deserted: could he be a wise man who should not avenge the insults, but permit those over whom he had power to have the enjoyment of his property? Can such forbearance be found in any one? If, indeed, it is to be called forbearance, and not rather a kind of insensible stupor. But it is easy to endure contempt. What if those things were done which are spoken of by Cicero?  For I ask, if any head of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>,  when his children had been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by a slave, his wife slain and his house set on fire, should not exact most severe punishment from that slave, whether he would appear to be kind and merciful, or inhuman and most cruel? But if to pardon <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of this kind is the part of cruelty rather than of kindness,  it is not therefore the part of goodness in God not to be moved at those things which are done <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>. For the world is, as it were, the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and men, as it were, His slaves; and if His name is a mockery to them, what kind or amount of forbearance is it to give  up His own honours, to see <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> things done, and not to be indignant, which is peculiar and natural to Him who is displeased with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>! To be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, therefore, is the part of reason: for thus faults are removed, and licentiousness is curbed; and this is plainly in accordance with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and wisdom. </p>

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> did not see that there is a distinction between right and wrong, that there is a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and also an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; and because they did not find a remedy for the matter, they wished altogether to remove it. But the Peripatetics said that it was not to be cut out, but moderated; to whom we have made a sufficient reply in the sixth book of the <em>Institutions</em>.  Now, that the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, is plain from their definitions, which Seneca enumerated in the books which he composed on the subject of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. <q>Anger is,</q> he says, <q>the desire of avenging an injury.</q> Others, as Posidonius says, describe it as the desire of punishing him by whom you think that you have been unfairly injured. Some have thus defined it: <q>Anger is an incitement of the mind to injure him who either has committed an injury, or who has wished to do so.</q> The definition of Aristotle does not differ greatly from ours;  for he says that <q><a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is the desire of requiting pain.</q> This is the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, concerning which we spoke before, which is contained even in the dumb animals; but it is to be restrained in man, lest he should rush to some very great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> through rage. This cannot exist in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He cannot be injured;  but it is found in man, inasmuch as he is frail. For the inflicting  of injury inflames  anguish, and anguish produces a desire of revenge. Where, then, is that just <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against offenders? For this is evidently not the desire of revenge, inasmuch as no injury precedes. I do not speak of those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; for although a judge may be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with these without incurring blame, let us, however, suppose that he ought to be of a sedate mind when he sentences the guilty to punishment, because he is the executor  of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, not of his own spirit or power; for so they wish it who endeavour to extirpate <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. But I speak of those in particular who are in our own power, as slaves, children, wives, and pupils; for when we see these offend, we are incited to restrain them. </p>

<p>For it cannot fail to be, that he who is just and good is displeased with things which are bad, and that he who is displeased with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is moved when he sees it practised. Therefore we arise to take vengeance, not because we have been injured, but that discipline may be preserved, morals may be corrected, and licentiousness be suppressed. This is just <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; and as it is necessary in man for the correction of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, so manifestly is it necessary in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from whom an example comes to man. For as we ought to restrain those who are subject to our power, so also ought God to restrain the offenses of all. And in order that He may do this, He must be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>; because it is natural for one who is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to be moved and incited at the fault of another. Therefore they ought to have given this definition: Anger is an emotion of the mind arousing itself for the restraining of faults.  For the definition given by Cicero, <q>Anger is the desire of taking vengeance,</q> does not differ much from those already mentioned.  But that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> which we may call either fury or rage ought not to exist even in man, because it is altogether vicious; but the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> which relates to the correction of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> ought not to be taken away from man; nor can it be taken away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because it is both serviceable for the affairs of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and necessary. </p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; Of the Punishment of Faults, that It Cannot Take Place Without Anger.</h2>

<p>What need is there, they say, of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, since faults can be corrected without this affection? But there is no one who can calmly see any one committing an offense. This may perhaps be possible in him who presides over the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, because the deed is not committed before his eyes, but it is brought before him as a doubtful matter from another quarter. Nor can any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> be so manifest, that there is no place for a defence; and therefore it is possible that a judge may not be moved against him who may possibly be found to be innocent; and when the detected crime shall have come to light, he now no longer uses his own opinion, but that of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. It may be granted that he does that which he does without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; for he has that which he may follow. We, undoubtedly, when an offense is committed by our household at home, whether we see or perceive it, must be indignant; for the very sight of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is unbecoming. For he who is altogether unmoved either approves of faults, which is more disgraceful and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, or avoids the trouble of reproving them, which a tranquil spirit and a quiet mind despises and refuses, unless <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> shall have aroused and incited it. But when any one is moved, and yet through unseasonable leniency grants pardon more frequently than is necessary, or at all times, he evidently both destroys the life of those whose audacity he is fostering for greater crimes, and furnishes himself with a perpetual source of annoyances. Therefore the restraining of one's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in the case of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is faulty. </p>

<p>Archytas of Tarentum is praised, who, when he had found everything ruined  on his estate, rebuking the fault of his bailiff, said, <q>Wretch, I would have beaten you to death if I had not been <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.</q> They consider this to be a singular example of forbearance; but influenced by authority, they do not see how foolishly he spoke and acted. For if (as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says) no <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> man punishes because there is an offense, but to prevent the occurrence of an offense, it is evident how <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> an example this wise man put forth. For if slaves shall perceive that their master uses <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> when he is not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and abstains from <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>  when he is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, it is evident that they will not commit slight offenses, lest they should be beaten; but will commit the greatest offenses, that they may arouse the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of the perverse man, and escape with impunity. But I should praise him if, when he was enraged, he had given space to his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, that the excitement of his mind might calm down through the interval of time, and his chastisement might be confined within moderate limits. Therefore, on account of the magnitude of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, punishment ought not to have been inflicted, but to have been delayed, lest it should inflict  upon the offender pain greater than is just, or occasion an outburst of fury in the punisher. But how, how is it equitable or wise, that any one should be punished on account of a slight offense, and should be unpunished on account of a very great one? But if he had learned the nature and causes of things, he never would have professed so unsuitable a forbearance, that a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> slave should <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that his master has been <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with him. For as God has furnished the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body with many and various senses which are necessary for the use of life, so also He has assigned to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> various affections by which the course of life might be regulated; and as He has given desire for the sake of producing offspring, so has He given <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> for the sake of restraining faults. </p>

<p>But they who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the ends of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, as they employ sensual desire for the purposes of corruption and pleasure, in the same manner make use of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and passion for the inflicting of injury, while they are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with those whom they regard with <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. Therefore they are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> even with those who commit no offense, even with their equals, or even with their superiors. Hence they daily rush to monstrous  <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; hence tragedies often arise. Therefore Archytas would be deserving of praise, if, when he had been enraged against any citizen or equal who injured him, he had curbed himself, and by forbearance mitigated the impetuosity of his fury. This self-restraint is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, by which any great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which impends is restrained; but it is a fault not to check the faults of slaves and children; for through their escaping without punishment they will proceed to greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In this case <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is not to be restrained; but even if it is in a state of inactivity,  it must be aroused. But that which we say respecting man, we also say respecting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made man like to Himself. I omit making mention of the figure of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> say that God has no form, and another great subject will arise if we should wish to refute them. I only speak respecting the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. If it belongs  to God to reflect, to be wise, to understand, to foresee. to excel, and of all animals man alone has these qualities, it follows that he was made after the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but on this account he goes on to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, because, being mingled with frailty derived from earth, he is unable to preserve pure and uncontaminated that which he has received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless he is imbued with the precepts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by the same God. </p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; Of the Soul and Body, and of Providence.</h2>

<p>But since he is made up, as we have said, of two parts, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are contained in the one, and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> in the other, and they mutually oppose each other. For the good properties of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which consist in restraining <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, are contrary to the body; and the good properties of the body, which consist in every kind of pleasure, are hostile to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But if the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall have resisted the desires, and suppressed them, he will be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. From which it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which is capable of divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is not mortal. But there is this distinction, that since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is attended with bitterness, and the attraction of pleasure is sweet, great numbers are overcome and are drawn aside to the pleasantness; but they who have given themselves up to the body and earthly things are pressed to the earth, and are unable to attain to the favour of the divine bounty, because they have polluted themselves with the defilements of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. But they who, following <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to Him, have despised the desires of the body, and, preferring <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to pleasures, have preserved innocence and righteousness, these God recognises as like to Himself. </p>

<p>Since, therefore, He has laid down a most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> law, and wishes all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be innocent and beneficent, is it possible that He should not be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> when He sees that His law is despised, that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is rejected, and pleasure made the object of pursuit? But if He is the governor of the world, as He might to be, He surely does not despise that which is even of the greatest importance in the whole world. If He has foresight, as it is befitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should have, it is plain that He consults the interests of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, in order that our life may be more abundantly supplied, and better, and safer. If He is the Father and God of all, He is undoubtedly delighted with the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and provoked by their <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Therefore He loves the just, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. There is no need (one says) of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; for He once for all has fixed a reward for the good, and punishment for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. But if any one lives <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> and innocently, and at the same time neither worships God nor has any regard for Him, as <a href="../cathen/01712d.htm">Aristides</a>, and Timon,  and others of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, will he escape  with impunity, because, though he has <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he has nevertheless despised God Himself? There is therefore something on account of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with one rebelling against Him, as it were, in reliance upon His integrity. If He can be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with this man on account of his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, why not more so with the sinner, who has despised the law together with the Lawgiver? The judge cannot pardon offenses, because he is subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of another. But God can pardon, because He is Himself the arbitrator  and judge of His own law; and when He laid down this, He did not surely deprive Himself of all power, but He has the liberty of bestowing pardon. </p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; Of Offences, and the Mercy of God.</h2>

<p>If He is able to pardon, He is therefore able also to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. Why, then, some one will say, does it often occur, that they who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are prosperous, and they who live piously are wretched? Because fugitives and disinherited  <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> live without restraint, and they who are under the discipline of a father or master live in a more strict and frugal manner. For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> and fixed  by means of ills; <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> by means of pleasure. Nor, however, ought he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to hope for lasting impunity, because there is no lasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. </p> <blockquote><p><q>But, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the last day is always to be looked for by man and no one ought to be called <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> before his death and last funeral <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>,</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>as the not inelegant poet says. It is the end which proves <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and no one is able to escape the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either when alive or after death. For He has the power both to cast down the living from on high, and to punish the dead with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> torments. Nay, he says, if God is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, He ought to have inflicted vengeance at once, and to have punished every one according to his desert. But (it is replied) if He had done this, no one would survive. For there is no one who offends in no respect, and there are many things which excite to the commission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash; age, intemperance, want, opportunity, reward. To such an extent is the frailty of the flesh with which we are clothed liable to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that unless God were indulgent to this necessity, perhaps too few would live. On this account He is most patient, and restrains His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For because there is in Him perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it follows of necessity that His patience also is perfect, which is itself also a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. How many men, from having been sinners, have afterwards become righteous; from being injurious, have become good; from being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, have become temperate! How many who were in early life base, and condemned by the judgment of all, afterwards have turned out praiseworthy? But it is plain that this could not happen if punishment followed every offense. </p>

<p>The public <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> condemn those who are manifestly guilty; but there are great numbers whose offenses are concealed, great numbers who restrain the accuser either by entreaties or by reward, great numbers who elude <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by favour or influence. But if the divine censure should condemn all those who escape the punishment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, there would be few or even no men on the earth. In short, even that one reason for destroying the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> might have been a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> one, that men, despising the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, pay divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to earthly and frail images, as though they were of heaven, adoring works made by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> hands. And though God their Creator made them of elevated countenance and upright figure, and raised them to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the heaven and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they have preferred, like cattle, to bend themselves to the earth.  For he is low, and curved, and bent downward, who, turning away from the sight of heaven and God his Father, worships things of the earth, which he ought to have trodden upon, that is, things made and fashioned from earth. Therefore, amidst such great impiety and such great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the forbearance of God attains this object, that men, condemning the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of their past life, correct themselves. In short, there are many who are just and good; and these, having laid aside the worship of earthly things, acknowledge the majesty of the one and only God. But though the forbearance of God is very great and most useful; yet, although late, He punishes the guilty, and does not suffer them to proceed further, when He sees that they are incorrigible. </p>

<h2>Chapter 21.&mdash; Of the Anger of God and Man.</h2>

<p>There remains one question, and that the last. For some one will perhaps say, that God is so far from being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, that in His precepts He even forbids man to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. I might say that the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of man ought to be curbed, because he is often <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>; and he has immediate emotion, because he is only for a time.  Therefore, lest those things should be done which the low, and those of moderate station, and great kings do in their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, his rage ought to have been moderated and suppressed, lest, being out of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,  he should commit some inexpiable crime. But God is not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> for a short time,  because He is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and of perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and He is never <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> unless deservedly. But, however, the matter is not so; for if He should altogether prohibit <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, He Himself would have been in some measure the censurer of His own workmanship, since He from the beginning had inserted <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in the liver  of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this emotion is contained in the moisture of the gall. Therefore He does not altogether prohibit <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, because that affection is necessarily given, but He forbids us to persevere in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of mortals ought to be mortal; for if it is lasting, enmity is strengthened to lasting destruction. Then, again, when He enjoined us to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and yet not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,  it is plain that He did not tear up <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> by the roots, but restrained it, that in every correction we might preserve moderation and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Therefore He who commands us to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> is manifestly Himself <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>; He who enjoins us to be quickly appeased is manifestly Himself easy to be appeased: for He has enjoined those things which are just and useful for the interests of society.  </p>

<p>But because I had said that the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of God is not for a time  only, as is the case with man, who becomes inflamed with an immediate  excitement, and on account of his frailty is unable easily to govern himself, we ought to understand that because God is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> also remains to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; but, on the other hand, that because He is endued with the greatest excellence, He controls His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and is not ruled by it, but that He regulates it according to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. And it is plain that this is not opposed to that which has just been said. For if His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> had been altogether <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, there would be no place after a fault for satisfaction or kind feeling, though He Himself commands men to be reconciled before the setting of the sun.  But the divine <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> remains for ever against those who ever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore God is appeased not by <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> or a victim, not by costly offerings, which things are all corruptible, but by a reformation of the morals: and he who ceases to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> renders the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of God mortal. For this reason He does not immediately  punish every one who is guilty, that man may have the opportunity of coming to a right <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,  and correcting himself. </p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; Of Sins, and the Verses of the Sibyls Respecting Them Recited.</h2>

<p>This is what I had to say, most beloved Donatus, respecting the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to refute those who represent God as being without emotions.  It only remains that, after the practice of Cicero, I should use an epilogue by way of peroration. As he did in the <em>Tusculan Disputations</em>,  when discoursing on the subject of death, so we in this work ought to bring forward divine testimonies, which may be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, to refute the persuasion of those who, believing that God is without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, destroy all religion, without which, as we have shown, we are either equal to the brutes in savageness, or to the cattle in foolishness; for it is in religion only&mdash; that is, in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Supreme God&mdash; that wisdom consists. All the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, being filled with the Divine Spirit, speak nothing else than of the favour of God towards the righteous, and His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against the ungodly. And their testimony is indeed sufficient for us; but because it is not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by those who make a display of wisdom by their hair and dress,  it was necessary to refute them by reason and arguments. For they act so preposterously,  that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things give authority to divine things, whereas divine things ought rather to give authority to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. But let us now leave these things, lest we should produce no effect upon them, and the subject should be indefinitely drawn out. Let us therefore seek those testimonies which they can either <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, or at any rate not oppose. </p>

<p>Authors of great number and weight have made mention of the Sibyls; of the Greeks, Aristo the Chian, and Apollodorus the Erythr&aelig;an; of our writers, Varro and Fenestella. All these relate that the Erythr&aelig;an Sibyl was distinguished and noble beyond the rest. Apollodorus, indeed, boasts of her as his own citizen and countrywoman. But Fenestella also relates that ambassadors were sent by the senate to Erythr&aelig;, that the verses of this Sibyl might be conveyed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and that the consuls Curio and Octavius might take care that they should be placed in the Capitol, which had then been restored under the care of Quintus Catulus. In her writings, verses of this kind are found respecting the Supreme God and Maker of the world:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>The incorruptible and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Maker who dwells in the heaven, holding forth good to the good, a much greater reward, but stirring up <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and rage against the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Again, in another place, enumerating the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is especially moved to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, she introduced these things:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Avoid unlawful services, and serve the living God. Abstain from <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and impurity; bring up a pure generation of children; do not kill: for the Immortal will be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with every one who may <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Therefore He is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with sinners. </p>

<h2>Chapter 23.&mdash; Of the Anger of God and the Punishment of Sins, and a Recital of the Verses of the Sibyls Respecting It; And, Moreover, a Reproof and Exhortation.</h2>

<p>But because it is related by most learned men that there have been many Sibyls, the testimony of one may not be sufficient to confirm the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as we purpose to do. The volumes, indeed, of the Cum&aelig;an Sibyl, in which are written the fates of the Romans are kept secret; but the writings of all the others are, for the most part, not prohibited from being in common use. And of these another, denouncing the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of God against all nations on account of the impiety of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, thus began:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Since great <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is coming upon a disobedient world, I disclose the commands of God to the last age, prophesying to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from city to city.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Another Sibyl also said, that the deluge was caused by the indignation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> against the unrighteous in a former age, that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> might be extinguished:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>From the time when, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of heaven being enraged against the cities themselves and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, a deluge having burst forth, the sea covered the earth.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>In like manner she foretold a conflagration about to take place hereafter, in which the impiety of men should again be destroyed:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q> And at some time, God no longer soothing His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but increasing it, and destroying the race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and laying waste the whole of it by fire.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>From which mention is thus made concerning Jupiter by Ovid: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>He remembers also that it is fated that the time shall come in which the sea, the earth, and the palace of heaven, being caught by fire, shall be burnt, and the curiously wrought framework of the world  be in danger.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And this must come to pass at the time when the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and worship of the Supreme shall have perished among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. The same Sibyl, however, testifying that He was appeased by reformation  of conduct and self-improvement, added these things:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But, you mortals, in pity  turn yourselves now, and do not lead the great God to every kind of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And also a little later:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>He will not destroy, but will again restrain His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, if you all practice valuable <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> in your minds.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Then another Sibyl declares that the Father of heavenly and earthly things ought to be loved, lest His indignation should arise, to the destruction of men:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Lest by chance the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> God should be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and destroy the whole race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, their life and shameless race, it is befitting that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the wise, ever-living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>From these things it is evident that the arguments of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are vain, who <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that God is without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and among His other praises reckon that which is most useless, detracting from Him that which is most salutary for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, by which majesty itself exists. For this earthly kingdom and government, unless guarded by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, is broken down. Take away <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> from a king, and he will not only cease to be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, but he will even be cast down headlong from his height. Yea, rather take away this affection from any person of low degree, and who will not plunder him? Who will not deride him? Who will not treat him with injury? Thus he will be able to have neither clothing, nor an abode, nor food, since others will deprive him of whatever he has; much less can we suppose that the majesty of the heavenly government can exist without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. The Milesian Apollo being consulted concerning the religion of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, inserted these things in his answer:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the King and Father of all, before whom the earth trembles, and the heaven and sea, and whom the recesses of Tartarus and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> dread.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>If He is so mild, as the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> will have it, how is it that not only the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and ministers of such great power, but even the heaven and earth, and the whole system of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, tremble at His presence? For if no one submits to the service of another except by compulsion, it follows that all government exists by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> by <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For if any one is not aroused against one who is unwilling to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, it will not be possible for him to be compelled to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. Let any one consult his own feelings; he will at once understand that no one can be subdued to the command of another without <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and chastisement. Therefore, where there shall be no <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, there will be no authority. But God has authority; therefore also He must have <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, in which authority consists. Therefore let no one, induced by the empty prating  of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, train himself to the contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the greatest impiety. We all are bound both to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, because He is our Father; and to reverence Him, because He is our Lord: both to pay Him <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, because He is bounteous; and to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him, because He is severe: each character in Him is worthy of reverence.  Who can preserve his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and yet fail to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the parent of his life? Or who can with impunity despise Him who, as ruler of all things, has <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and everlasting power over all? If you consider Him in the character of Father, He supplies to us our entrance to the light which we enjoy: through Him we live, through Him we have entered into the abode  of this world. If you contemplate Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is He who nourishes us with innumerable resources: it is He who sustains us, we dwell in His house, we are His household;  and if we are less <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> than was befitting, and less attentive to our duty  than the endless merits of our Master and Parent demanded: nevertheless it is, of great avail to our obtaining pardon, if we retain the worship and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him; if, laying aside low and earthly affairs and goods, we meditate upon heavenly and divine things which are everlasting. And that we may be able to do this, God must be followed by us, God must be adored and loved; since there is in Him the substance  of things, the principle  of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and the source of all that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. </p>

<p>For what is greater in power than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or more perfect in reason, or brighter in clearness? And since He begot us to wisdom, and produced us to righteousness, it is not allowable for man to forsake <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the giver of intelligence and life and to serve earthly and frail things, or, intent upon seeking temporal goods, to turn aside from innocence and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Vicious and deadly pleasures do not render a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; nor does opulence, which is the inciter of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>; nor empty ambition; nor frail honours, by which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, being ensnared and enslaved to the body, is condemned  to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death: but innocence and righteousness alone, the lawful and due reward of which is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the beginning appointed for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and uncorrupted minds, which keep themselves pure and uncontaminated from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and from every earthly impurity. Of this heavenly and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward they cannot be partakers, who have polluted their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, frauds, rapine, and deceits; and who, by injuries inflicted upon men, by impious actions, have branded themselves  with indelible stains. Accordingly it is befitting that all who wish deservedly to be called wise, who wish to be called men, should despise frail things, should trample upon earthly things, and should look down upon base  things, that they may be able to be united in a most blissful relationship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<p>Let impiety and discords be removed; let turbulent and deadly dissensions be allayed,  by which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> societies and the divine union of the public league are broken in upon, divided, and dispersed; as far as we can, let us aim at being good and bounteous: if we have a supply of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and resources, let it not be devoted to the pleasure of a single person, but bestowed on the welfare of many. For pleasure is as short lived as the body to which it does service. But <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and kindness are as <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> as the mind and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which by good works attain to the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Let God be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by us, not in temples, but in our heart. All things which are made by the hand are destructible.  Let us cleanse this temple, which is defiled not by smoke or dust, but by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts which is lighted not by blazing tapers  but by the brightness and light of wisdom. And if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God is always present in this temple, to whose divinity the secrets of the heart are open, we shall so live as always to have Him propitious, and never to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</p>
