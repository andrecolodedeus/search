<h1>On the Apparel of Women</h1>


<h2>Book I</h2>

<h3>Chapter 1. Introduction. Modesty in Apparel Becoming to Women, in Memory of the Introduction of Sin into the World Through a Woman</h3>

<p>If there dwelt upon earth a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as great as is the reward of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is expected in the heavens, no one of you at all, best beloved sisters, from the time that she had first <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Lord,</q>  and learned (the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>) concerning her own (that is, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a>) condition, would have desired too gladsome (not to say too ostentatious) a style of dress; so as not rather to go about in <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> garb, and rather to affect meanness of appearance, walking about as Eve mourning and repentant, in order that by every garb of penitence  she might the more fully expiate that which she derives from Eve,&mdash; the ignominy, I mean, of the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the odium (attaching to her as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>) of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> perdition. <q>In pains and in anxieties do you bear (children), <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; and toward your husband (is) your inclination, and he lords it over you.</q>  And do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are (each) an Eve? The sentence of God on this sex of yours lives in this age:  the guilt must of necessity live too. <em>You</em> are the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> gateway: <em>you</em> are the unsealer  of that (forbidden) tree: <em>you</em> are the first deserter of the divine law: <em>you</em> are she who persuaded  him whom the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was not valiant enough to attack. <em>You</em> destroyed so easily God's image, man. On account of <em>your</em> desert&mdash; that is, death&mdash; even the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> had to die. And do you think about adorning yourself over and above your tunics of skins?  Come, now; if from the beginning of the world  the Milesians sheared sheep, and the Serians  spun trees, and the Tyrians dyed, and the Phrygians embroidered with the needle, and the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a> with the loom, and pearls gleamed, and onyx-stones flashed; if gold itself also had already issued, with the cupidity (which accompanies it), from the ground; if the mirror, too, already had licence to lie so largely, Eve, expelled from paradise, (Eve) already dead, would also have <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> <em>these</em> things, I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>! No more, then, ought she <em>now</em> to crave, or be acquainted with (if she desires to live again), what, when she <em>was</em> living, she had neither had nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Accordingly these things are all the baggage of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in her condemned and dead state, instituted as if to swell the pomp of her funeral.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2. The Origin of Female Ornamentation, Traced Back to the Angels Who Had Fallen.</h3> 

<p>For they, withal, who instituted them are assigned, under condemnation, to the penalty of death&mdash;those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, to wit, who rushed from heaven on the daughters of men; so that this ignominy also attaches to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. For when to an age  much more <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> (than ours) they had disclosed certain well-concealed material substances, and several not well-revealed scientific arts&mdash; if it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that they had laid bare the operations of metallurgy, and had divulged the natural properties of herbs, and had promulgated the powers of enchantments, and had traced out every curious art,  even to the interpretation of the stars&mdash; they conferred properly and as it were peculiarly upon <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that instrumental mean of womanly ostentation, the radiances of jewels wherewith necklaces are variegated, and the circlets of gold wherewith the arms are compressed, and the medicaments of orchil with which wools are coloured, and that black powder itself wherewith the eyelids and eyelashes are made prominent.  What is the quality of these things may be declared meantime, even at this point,  from the quality and condition of their teachers: in that sinners could never have either shown or supplied anything conducive to integrity, unlawful lovers anything conducive to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, renegade spirits anything conducive to the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If (these things) are to be called <em>teachings</em>, ill masters must of necessity have taught ill; if as <em>wages of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a></em>, there is nothing base of which the wages are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>. But why was it of so much importance to show these things as well as  to confer them? Was it that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, without material causes of splendour, and without ingenious contrivances of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, could not please <em>men</em>, who, while still unadorned, and uncouth and&mdash; so to say&mdash; crude and rude, had moved (the mind of) <em><a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a></em>? Or was it that the lovers  would appear sordid and&mdash; through gratuitous use&mdash; contumelious, if they had conferred no (compensating) gift on the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who had been enticed into connubial connection with them? But these questions admit of no calculation. Women who possessed <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (as husbands) could desire nothing more; they had, forsooth, made a grand match! Assuredly they who, of course, did sometimes think whence they had fallen,  and, after the heated impulses of their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, looked up toward heaven, thus requited that very excellence of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, natural beauty, as (having <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>) a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in order that their good fortune might profit them nothing; but that, being turned from simplicity and sincerity, they, together with (the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>) themselves, might become offensive to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Sure they were that all ostentation, and ambition, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of pleasing by carnal means, was <em>dis</em>pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And these are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> whom we are destined to judge:  these are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> whom in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> we renounce:  these, of course, are the reasons why they have deserved to be judged by man. What business, then, have their <em>things</em> with their <em>judges</em>? What commerce have they who are to condemn with them who are to be condemned? The same, I take it, as Christ has with <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>.  With what consistency do we mount that (future) judgment-seat to pronounce sentence against those whose gifts we (now) seek after? For you too, (<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as you are,) have the self-same angelic nature promised  as your reward, the self-same sex as men: the self-same advancement to the dignity of judging, does (the Lord) promise you. Unless, then, we begin even here to <em>pre-</em>judge, by pre-condemning their <em>things</em>, which we are hereafter to condemn in <em>themselves</em>, <em>they</em> will rather judge and condemn <em>us</em>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3. Concerning the Genuineness of <q>The Prophecy of Enoch.</q></h3> 

<p>I am aware that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> of <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>,  which has assigned this order (of action) to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, is not received by some, because it is not admitted into the Jewish canon either. I suppose they did not think that, having been published before the deluge, it could have safely survived that world-wide calamity, the abolisher of all things. If that is the reason (for rejecting it), let them recall to their memory that <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, the survivor of the deluge, was the great-grandson of <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> himself;  and he, of course, had heard and remembered, from domestic renown  and hereditary tradition, concerning his own great-grandfather's <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  and concerning all his preachings;  since <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> had given no other charge to <a href="../cathen/10048b.htm">Methuselah</a> than that he should hand on the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them to his posterity. <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> therefore, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, might have succeeded in the trusteeship of (his) preaching; or, had the case been otherwise, he would not have been silent alike concerning the disposition (of things) made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his Preserver, and concerning the particular <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of his own house.</p>

<p>If (<a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>) had not had this (conservative power) by so short a route, there would (still) be this (consideration) to warrant  our assertion of (the genuineness of) this Scripture: he could equally have <em>renewed</em> it, under the Spirit's inspiration,  after it <em>had</em> been destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the deluge, as, after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonian storming of it, every document  of the Jewish literature is generally agreed to have been restored through Ezra.</p>

<p>But since <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> in the same Scripture has preached likewise concerning the Lord, nothing at all must be rejected <em>by</em> us which pertains <em>to</em> us; and we read that <q>every Scripture suitable for edification is divinely inspired.</q>  By the <em><a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></em> it may now seem to have been rejected for that (very) reason, just like all the other (portions) nearly which tell of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Nor, of course, is this fact wonderful, that they did not receive some Scriptures which spoke of Him whom even in person, speaking in their presence, they were not to receive. To these considerations is added the fact that <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> possesses a testimony in the Apostle Jude. </p>

<h3>Chapter 4. Waiving the Question of the Authors, Tertullian Proposes to Consider the Things on Their Own Merits</h3>

<p>Grant now that no mark of pre-condemnation has been branded on womanly pomp by the (fact of the) <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>  of its authors; let nothing be imputed to those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> besides their repudiation of heaven and (their) carnal marriage:  let us examine the qualities of the things themselves, in order that we may detect the purposes also for which they are eagerly desired.</p>

<p>Female habit carries with it a twofold idea&mdash; dress and ornament. By <q>dress</q> we mean what they call <q>womanly gracing;</q>  by <q>ornament,</q> what it is suitable should be called <q>womanly <em>dis</em>gracing.</q>  The former is accounted (to consist) in gold, and silver, and gems, and garments; the latter in care of the hair, and of the skin, and of those parts of the body which attract the eye. Against the one we lay the charge of ambition, against the other of prostitution; so that even from this early stage  (of our discussion) you may look forward and see what, out of (all) these, is suitable, handmaid of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to <em>your</em> discipline, inasmuch as you are assessed on different principles (from other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>)&mdash;those, namely, of humility and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5. Gold and Silver Not Superior in Origin or in Utility to Other Metals</h3>

<p>Gold and silver, the principal material causes of worldly  splendour, must necessarily be identical (in nature) with that out of which they have their being: (they must be) earth, that is; (which earth itself is) plainly more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> (than they), inasmuch as it is only after it has been tearfully wrought by penal labour in the deadly laboratories of accursed mines, and there left its name of <q>earth</q> in the fire behind it, that, as a fugitive from the mine, it passes from torments to ornaments, from punishments to embellishments, from ignominies to honours. But iron, and brass, and other the vilest material substances, enjoy a parity of condition (with silver and gold), both as to earthly origin and metallurgic operation; in order that, in the estimation of nature, the substance of gold and of silver may be judged not a whit more noble (than theirs). But if it is from the quality of <em>utility</em> that gold and silver derive their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, why, iron and brass excel them; whose usefulness is so disposed (by the Creator), that they not only discharge functions of their own more numerous and more necessary to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, but do also none the less serve the turn of gold and silver, by dint of their own powers,  in the service of juster causes. For not only are rings made of iron, but the memory of antiquity still preserves (the fame of) certain vessels for eating and drinking made out of brass. Let the insane plenteousness of gold and silver look to it, if it serves to make utensils even for foul purposes. At all events, neither is the field tilled by means of gold, nor the ship fastened together by the strength of silver. No mattock plunges a golden edge into the ground; no nail drives a silver point into planks. I leave unnoticed the fact that the needs of our whole life are dependent upon iron and brass; whereas those rich materials themselves, requiring both to be dug up out of mines, and needing a forging process in every use (to which they are put), are helpless without the laborious vigour of iron and brass. Already, therefore, we must judge whence it is that so high dignity accrues to gold and silver, since they get precedence over material substances which are not only cousin-german to them in point of origin, but more powerful in point of usefulness.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6. Of Precious Stones and Pearls</h3>

<p>But, in the next place, what am I to interpret those jewels to be which vie with gold in haughtiness, except little pebbles and stones and paltry particles of the self-same earth; but yet not necessary either for laying down foundations, or rearing party-walls, or supporting pediments, or giving density to roofs? The only edifice which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to rear is this silly <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: because they require slow rubbing that they may shine, and artful underlaying that they may show to advantage, and careful piercing that they may hang; and (because they) render to gold a mutual assistance in meretricious allurement.  But whatever it is that ambition fishes up from the British or the Indian sea, it is a kind of conch not more pleasing in <em>savour</em> than&mdash; I do not say the oyster and the sea-snail, but&mdash; even the giant muscle.  For let me add that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> conchs (which are) sweet fruits of the sea. But if that (foreign) conch suffers from some internal pustule, that ought to be regarded rather as its defect than as its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and although it be called <q>pearl,</q> still something else must be understood than some hard, round excrescence of the fish. Some say, too, that gems are culled from the foreheads of <em>dragons</em>, just as in the brains of fishes there is a certain stony substance. This also was wanting to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, that she may add a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to herself from the serpent! Is it thus that she will set her heel on the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> head,  while she heaps ornaments (taken) from his head on her own neck, or on her very head?</p>

<h3>Chapter 7. Rarity the Only Cause Which Makes Such Things Valuable</h3>

<p>It is only from their rarity and outlandishness that all these things possess their <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; in short, within their own native limits they are not held of so high worth. Abundance is always contumelious toward itself. There are some barbarians with whom, because gold is indigenous and plentiful, it is customary to keep (the criminals) in their convict establishments chained with gold, and to lade the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> with riches&mdash; the more guilty, the more <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>. At last there has really been found a way to prevent even gold from being loved! We have also seen at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the nobility of gems blushing in the presence of our matrons at the contemptuous usage of the Parthians and Medes, and the rest of their own fellow-countrymen, only that (<em>their</em> gems) are not generally worn with a view to ostentation. Emeralds  lurk in their belts; and the sword (that hangs) below their bosom alone is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the cylindrical stones that decorate its hilt; and the massive single pearls on their boots are fain to get lifted out of the mud! In short, they carry nothing so richly gemmed as that which ought <em>not</em> to be gemmed if it is (either) not conspicuous, or else is conspicuous only that it may be shown to be also neglected.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8. The Same Rule Holds with Regard to Colours. God's Creatures Generally Not to Be Used, Except for the Purposes to Which He Has Appointed Them</h3>

<p>Similarly, too, do even the servants  of those barbarians <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to fade from the colours of our garments (by wearing the like); nay, even their party-walls use slightingly, to supply the place of painting, the Tyrian and the violet-coloured and the grand royal hangings, which you laboriously undo and metamorphose. Purple with them is more paltry than red ochre; (and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>,) for what legitimate <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> can garments derive from adulteration with illegitimate colours? That which He Himself has not produced is not pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless He was <em>unable</em> to order sheep to be born with purple and sky-blue fleeces! If He was <em>able</em>, then plainly He was <em>unwilling</em>: what God willed not, of course ought not to be fashioned. Those things, then, are not the best by <em>nature</em> which are not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <em>Author</em> of nature. Thus they are understood to be from <em>the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a></em>, from the <em>corrupter</em> of nature: for there is no other whose they can be, if they are not God's; because what are not God's must necessarily be His rival's.  But, beside the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, other rival of God there is none. Again, if the <em>material substances</em> are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it does not immediately follow that such ways of <em>enjoying</em> them among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> (are so too). It is matter for inquiry not only whence come conchs,  but what sphere of embellishment is assigned them, and where it is that they exhibit their beauty. For all those profane pleasures of worldly  shows&mdash; as we have already published a volume of their own about them &mdash; (ay, and) even <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> itself, derive their material causes from the creatures  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ought not to attach himself  to the frenzies of the racecourse, or the atrocities of the arena, or the turpitudes of the stage, simply because God has given to man the horse, and the panther, and the power of speech: just as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> cannot commit <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> with impunity either, because the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and the wine, and the fire which feeds  (thereon), and the animals which are made the victims, are God's workmanship;  since even the material thing which is adored is God's (creature). Thus then, too, with regard to their active use, does the <em>origin</em> of the material substances, which descends from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>excuse</em> (that use) as foreign to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as guilty forsooth of worldly  <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>!</p>

<h3>Chapter 9. God's Distribution Must Regulate Our Desires, Otherwise We Become the Prey of Ambition and Its Attendant Evils</h3>

<p>For, as some particular things distributed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over certain individual lands, and some one particular tract of sea, are mutually foreign one to the other, they are reciprocally either neglected or desired: (desired) among foreigners, as being rarities; neglected (rightly), if anywhere, among their own compatriots, because in <em>them</em> there is no such fervid longing for a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which, among its own home-folk, is frigid. But, however, the rareness and outlandishness which arise out of that distribution of possessions which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has ordered as He willed, ever finding favour in the eyes of strangers, excites, from the simple fact of <em>not</em> having what God has made native to other places, the concupiscence of <em>having</em> it. Hence is educed another <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>&mdash; that of <em>immoderate</em> having; because although, perhaps, <em>having</em> may be permissible, still a limit  is bound (to be observed). This (second <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>) will be ambition; and hence, too, its name is to be interpreted, in that from concupiscence <em>ambient</em> in the mind it is born, with a view to the desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>&mdash;a grand desire, forsooth, which (as we have said) is recommended neither by nature nor by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but by a vicious passion of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>&mdash;(namely,) concupiscence. And there are other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> connected with ambition and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Thus they have withal enhanced the <em>cost</em> of things, in order that (thereby) they might add fuel to themselves also; for concupiscence becomes proportionably greater as it has set a higher value upon the thing which it has eagerly desired. From the smallest caskets is produced an ample patrimony. On a single thread is suspended a million of sesterces. One delicate neck carries about it forests and islands.  The slender lobes of the ears exhaust a fortune; and the left hand, with its every finger, sports with a several money-bag. Such is the strength of ambition&mdash; (equal) to bearing on one small body, and that a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a>, the product of so copious <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>.</p>

<h2>Book II</h2>

<h3>Chapter 1. Introduction. Modesty to Be Observed Not Only in Its Essence, But in Its Accessories</h3>

<p>Handmaids of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my fellow-servants and sisters, the right which I enjoy with you&mdash; I, the most meanest  in that right of fellow-servantship and brotherhood&mdash; emboldens me to address to you a discourse, not, of course, of affection, but paving the way for affection in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. That <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>&mdash; and not (the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>) of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> only, but likewise of men&mdash; consists in the exhibition principally of modesty. For since, by the introduction into an appropriation  (in) us of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, we are all <q>the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  Modesty is the sacristan and priestess of that temple, who is to suffer nothing unclean or profane to be introduced (into it), for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that the God who inhabits it should be offended, and quite forsake the polluted abode. But on the present occasion we (are to speak) not about modesty, for the enjoining and exacting of which the divine precepts which press (upon us) on every side are sufficient; but about the matters which pertain to it, that is, the manner in which it behooves you to walk. For most <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (which very thing I trust God may permit me, with a view, of course, to my own personal censure, to censure in all), either from simple <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or else from dissimulation, have the hardihood so to walk as if modesty consisted only  in the (bare) integrity of the flesh, and in turning away from (actual) fornication; and there were no need for anything extrinsic to boot&mdash; in the matter (I mean) of the arrangement of dress and ornament,  the studied graces of form and brilliance:&mdash; wearing in their gait the self-same appearance as the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, from whom the sense of <em><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a></em> modesty is absent, because in those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Guardian and Master of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, there is <em>nothing</em> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.  For if any modesty can be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> (to exist) in <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, it is plain that it must be imperfect and undisciplined to such a degree that, although it be actively tenacious of itself in the <em>mind</em> up to a certain point, it yet allows itself to relax into licentious extravagances of attire; just in accordance with Gentile perversity, in craving after that of which it carefully shuns the effect.  How many a one, in short, is there who does not earnestly desire even to look pleasing to strangers? Who does not on that very account take care to have herself painted out, and denies that she has (ever) been an object of (carnal) appetite? And yet, granting that even this is a practice familiar to Gentile modesty&mdash; (namely,) not actually to <em>commit</em> the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but still to be <em>willing</em> to do so; or even not to be <em>willing</em>, yet still not <em>quite</em> to refuse&mdash; what wonder? For all things which are not God's are perverse. Let those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> therefore look to it, who, by not holding fast the <em>whole</em> good, easily mingle with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> even what they do hold fast. Necessary it is that <em>you</em> turn aside from them, as in all other things, so also in your gait; since you ought to be <q>perfect, as (is) your Father who is in the heavens.</q> </p>

<h3>Chapter 2. Perfect Modesty Will Abstain from Whatever Tends to Sin, as Well as from Sin Itself. Difference Between Trust and Presumption. If Secure Ourselves, We Must Not Put Temptation in the Way of Others. We Must Love Our Neighbour as Ourself</h3>

<p>You must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in the eye of perfect, that is, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, modesty, (carnal) desire of one's self (on the part of others) is not only not to be desired, but even execrated, by you: first, because the study of making personal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> (which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be naturally the inviter of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>) a mean of pleasing does not spring from a sound <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>: why therefore excite toward yourself that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (passion)? Why invite (that) to which you profess yourself a stranger? Secondly, because we ought not to open a way to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, which, by their instancy, sometimes achieve (a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>) which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> expels from them who are His; (or,) at all events, put the spirit into a thorough tumult by (presenting) a stumbling-block (to it). We ought indeed to walk so holily, and with so entire substantiality  of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as to be confident and secure in regard of our own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, <em>desiring</em> that that (gift) may abide in us to the end, yet not <em>presuming</em> (that it will). For he who presumes feels less apprehension; he who feels less apprehension takes less precaution; he who takes less precaution runs more risk. Fear  is the foundation of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; presumption is an impediment to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. More useful, then, is it to apprehend that we may possibly fail, than to presume that we cannot; for apprehending will lead us to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, fearing to caution, and caution to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. On the other hand, if we presume, there will be neither <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> nor caution to save us. He who acts securely, and not at the same time warily, possesses no safe and firm security; whereas he who is wary will be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> able to be secure. For His own servants, may the Lord by His mercy take care that to <em>them</em> it may be lawful even to <em>presume</em> on His goodness! But why are we a (source of) danger to our neighbour? Why do we import concupiscence into our neighbour? Which concupiscence, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in <q>amplifying the law,</q>  do not  dissociate in (the way of) penalty from the actual commission of fornication,  I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether He allows impunity to him who  has been the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of perdition to some other. For that other, as soon as he has felt concupiscence after your beauty, and has mentally already committed (the deed) which his concupiscence pointed to,  perishes; and you have been made  the sword which destroys him: so that, albeit you be free from the (actual) crime, you are not free from the odium (attaching to it); as, when a <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> has been committed on some man's estate, the (actual) crime indeed will not be laid to the owner's charge, while yet the domain is branded with ignominy, (and) the owner himself aspersed with the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>. Are we to paint ourselves out that our neighbours may perish? Where, then, is (the command), <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself?</q>  <q>Care not merely about your own (things), but (about your) neighbour's?</q>  No enunciation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> ought to be (confined) to the subject immediately in hand merely, and not applied and carried out with a view to <em>every</em> occasion to which its application is useful.  Since, therefore, both our own interest and that of others is implicated in the studious pursuit of most perilous (outward) comeliness, it is time for you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>  that not merely must the pageantry of fictitious and elaborate beauty be rejected by you; but that of even natural <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> must be obliterated by concealment and negligence, as equally dangerous to the glances of (the beholder's) eyes. For, albeit comeliness is not to be <em>censured</em>,  as being a bodily <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as being an additional outlay of the divine plastic art, as being a kind of goodly garment  of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; yet it is to be <em>feared</em>, just on account of the injuriousness and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of suitors:  which (injuriousness and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>) even the father of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,  <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,  greatly feared in regard of his own wife's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and Isaac,  by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> representing Rebecca as his sister, purchased safety by insult! </p>

<h3>Chapter 3. Grant that Beauty Be Not to Be Feared: Still It is to Be Shunned as Unnecessary and Vainglorious</h3>

<p>Let it now be granted that excellence of form be not to be feared, as neither troublesome to its possessors, nor destructive to its desirers, nor perilous to its compartners;  let it be thought (to be) not exposed to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, not surrounded by stumbling-blocks: it is enough that to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God  it is not necessary. For, where modesty is, there beauty is idle; because properly the use and fruit of beauty is voluptuousness, unless any one thinks that there is some other harvest for bodily <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to reap.  Are <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who think that, in furnishing to their <em>neighbour</em> that which is demanded of beauty, they are furnishing it to <em>themselves</em> also, to augment that (beauty) when (naturally) given them, and to strive after it when not (thus) given? Some one will say, <q>Why, then, if voluptuousness be shut out and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> let in, may (we) not enjoy the praise of beauty alone, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in a bodily good?</q> Let whoever finds pleasure in <q>glorying in the flesh</q>  see to that. To us in the first place, there is no studious pursuit of <q><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> because <q><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></q> is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <em>exaltation</em>. Now <em>exaltation</em> is incongruous for professors of <em>humility</em> according to God's precepts. Secondly, if <em>all</em> <q><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></q> is <q>vain</q> and insensate,  how much more (<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>) <em>in the flesh</em>, especially to <em>us</em>? For even if <q>glorying</q> is (allowable), we ought to wish our sphere of pleasing to lie in the graces  of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, not in the flesh; because we are <q>suitors</q>  of things spiritual. In those things wherein our sphere of labour lies, let our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> lie. From the sources whence we hope for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, let us cull our <q><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> Plainly, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <em>will</em> <q><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></q> even in the <em>flesh</em>; but (it will be) when it has endured laceration for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake,  in order that the spirit may be crowned in it, not in order that it may draw the eyes and sighs of youths after it. Thus (a thing) which, from whatever point you look at it, is in <em>your</em> case superfluous, you may <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> disdain if you have it not, and neglect if you have. Let a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, if naturally beautiful, give none so great occasion (for carnal appetite). Certainly, if even she be so, she ought not to set off (her beauty), but even to obscure it. </p>

<h3>Chapter 4. Concerning the Plea of <q>Pleasing the Husband.</q></h3>

<p>As if I were speaking to <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, addressing you with a Gentile precept, and (one which is) common to all, (I would say,) <q>You are bound to please your husbands only.</q>  But you will please <em>them</em> in proportion as you take no care to please <em>others</em>. Be without carefulness,  blessed (sisters): no wife is <q>ugly</q> to her own husband. She <q>pleased</q> him enough when she was selected (by him as his wife); whether commended by form or by character. Let none of you think that, if she abstain from the care of her person,  she will incur the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and aversion of husbands. Every husband is the exactor of <em><a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a></em>; but <em>beauty</em>, a believing (husband) does not require, because we are not captivated by the same graces  which the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> think (to be) graces:  an <em>un</em>believing one, on the other hand, even regards with suspicion, just from that <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> opinion of us which the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> have. For whom, then, is it that you cherish your beauty? If for a believer, he does not exact it: if for an <em>un</em>believer, he does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in it unless it be artless.  Why are you eager to please either one who is suspicious, or else one who desires it not?</p>

<h3>Chapter 5. Some Refinements in Dress and Personal Appearance Lawful, Some Unlawful. Pigments Come Under the Latter Head</h3>

<p>These suggestions are not made to you, of course, to be developed into an entire crudity and wildness of appearance; nor are we seeking to persuade you of the good of squalor and slovenliness; but of the limit and norm and just measure of cultivation of the person. There must be no overstepping of that line to which simple and sufficient refinements limit their desires&mdash; that line which is pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For they who rub  their skin with medicaments, stain their cheeks with rouge, make their eyes prominent with antimony,  <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against Him . To them, I suppose, the plastic skill  of God is displeasing! In their own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, I suppose, they convict, they censure, the Artificer of all things! For censure they do when they amend, when they add to, (His work;) taking these their additions, of course, from the adversary artificer. That adversary artificer is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.  For who would show the way to change the <em>body</em>, but he who by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> transfigured man's <em>spirit</em>? He it is, undoubtedly, who adapted ingenious devices of this kind; that in your <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> it may be apparent that you, in a certain sense, do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Whatever is <em>born</em> is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Whatever, then, is <em>plastered on</em>  (that), is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> work. To superinduce on a divine work <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan's</a> ingenuities, how criminal is it! Our servants borrow nothing from our personal enemies: soldiers eagerly desire nothing from the foes of their own general; for, to demand for (your own) use anything from the adversary of Him in whose hand  you are, is a transgression. Shall a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> be assisted in anything by that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one? (If he do,) I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether this name (of <q><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a></q>) will continue (to belong) to him; for he will be <em>his</em> in whose lore he eagerly desires to be instructed. But how alien from <em>your</em> schoolings  and professions are (these things)! How unworthy the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name, to wear a fictitious face, (you,) on whom simplicity in every form is enjoined!&mdash; to lie in your appearance, (you,) to whom (lying) with the tongue is not lawful!&mdash; to seek after what is another's, (you,) to whom is delivered (the precept of) abstinence from what is another's!&mdash; to practise <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> in your mien,  (you,) who make modesty your study! Think,  blessed (sisters), how will you keep God's precepts if you shall not keep in your own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> His lineaments?</p>

<h3>Chapter 6. Of Dyeing the Hair</h3>

<p>I see some (<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>) turn (the colour of) their hair with saffron. They are ashamed even of their own nation, (ashamed) that their procreation did not assign them to Germany and to <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>: thus, as it is, they transfer their <em>hair</em>  (there)! Ill, ay, <em>most</em> ill, do they augur for themselves with their flame-coloured head,  and think that graceful which (in fact) they are polluting! Nay, moreover, the force of the cosmetics burns ruin into the hair; and the constant application of even any <em>un</em>drugged moisture, lays up a store of harm for the head; while the sun's warmth, too, so desirable for imparting to the hair at once growth and dryness, is hurtful. What <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></q> is compatible with <q>injury?</q> What <q>beauty</q> with <q>impurities?</q> Shall a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> heap saffron on her head, as upon an altar?  For, whatever is wont to be burned to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the unclean spirit, that&mdash; unless it is applied for honest, and necessary, and salutary uses, for which God's creature was provided&mdash; may seem to be a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. But, however, God says, <q>Which of you can make a white hair black, or out of a black a white?</q>  And so they refute the Lord! <q>Behold!</q> say they, <q>instead of white or black, we make it <em>yellow</em>&mdash;more winning in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q>  And yet such as repent of having lived to old age do <em>attempt</em> to change it even from white to black! O temerity! The age which is the object of our wishes and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> blushes (for itself)! A theft is effected! Youth, wherein we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>,  is sighed after! The opportunity of sobriety is spoiled! Far from Wisdom's daughters be folly so great! The more old age tries to conceal itself, the more will it be detected. Here is a veritable <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, in the (perennial) youth of your head! Here we have an <q>incorruptibility</q> to <q>put on,</q>  with a view to the new house of the Lord  which the divine monarchy promises! Well do you speed toward the Lord; well do you hasten to be quit of this most iniquitous world,  to whom it is unsightly to approach (your own) end!</p>

<h3>Chapter 7. Of Elaborate Dressing of the Hair in Other Ways, and Its Bearing Upon Salvation</h3>

<p>What service, again, does all the labour spent in <em>arranging</em> the hair render to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? Why is no rest allowed to your hair, which must now be bound, now loosed, now cultivated, now thinned out? Some are anxious to force their hair into curls, some to let it hang loose and flying; not with good simplicity: beside which, you affix I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what enormities of subtle and textile perukes; now, after the manner of a helmet of undressed hide, as it were a sheath for the head and a covering for the crown; now, a mass (drawn) backward toward the neck. The wonder is, that there is no (open) contending against the Lord's prescripts! It has been pronounced that no one can add to his own stature.  <em>You</em>, however, <em>do</em> add to your <em>weight</em> some kind of rolls, or shield-bosses, to be piled upon your necks! If you feel no shame at the enormity, feel some at the pollution; for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> you may be fitting on a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> head the slough  of some one else's  head, unclean perchance, guilty perchance and destined to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.  Nay, rather banish quite away from your <q>free</q>  head all this slavery of ornamentation. In vain do you labour to seem adorned: in vain do you call in the aid of all the most skilful manufacturers of false hair. God bids you <q>be veiled.</q>  I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> (He does so) for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the heads of some should be seen! And oh that in <q>that day</q>  of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> exultation, I, most miserable (as I am), may elevate my head, even though below (the level of) your heels! I shall (then) see whether you will rise with (your) ceruse and rouge and saffron, and in all that parade of headgear:  whether it will be <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> thus tricked out whom the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> carry up to meet Christ in the air!  If these (decorations) are <em>now</em> good, and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they will <em>then</em> also present themselves to the rising bodies, and will recognise their several places. But nothing can rise except flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> sole and pure.  Whatever, therefore, does not rise in (the form of)  spirit and flesh is condemned, because it is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. From things which are condemned abstain, even at the present day. At the present day let God see you such as He will see you <em>then</em>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8. Men Not Excluded from These Remarks on Personal Adornment</h3>

<p>Of course, now, I, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as being <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>  of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, am banishing them quite from their own (domains). Are there, in our case too, some things which, in respect of the sobriety  we are to maintain on account of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>  due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are disallowed?  If it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, (as it is,) that in men, for the sake of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (just as in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> for the sake of men), there is implanted, by a defect of nature, the will to please; and if this sex of ours acknowledges to itself deceptive trickeries of form peculiarly its own&mdash;(such as) to cut the beard too sharply; to pluck it out here and there; to shave round about (the mouth); to arrange the hair, and disguise its hoariness by dyes; to remove all the incipient down all over the body; to fix (each particular hair) in its place with (some) womanly pigment; to smooth all the rest of the body by the aid of some rough powder or other: then, further, to take every opportunity for consulting the mirror; to gaze anxiously into it:&mdash; while yet, when (once) the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God has put an end to all wish to please by means of voluptuous attraction, all these things are rejected as frivolous, as hostile to modesty. For where God is, there modesty is; there is sobriety  her assistant and ally. How, then, shall we practise modesty without her instrumental mean,  that is, without sobriety?  How, moreover, shall we bring sobriety  to bear on the discharge of (the functions of) modesty, unless seriousness in appearance and in countenance, and in the general aspect  of the entire man, mark our carriage?</p>

<h3>Chapter 9. Excess in Dress, as Well as in Personal Culture, to Be Shunned. Arguments Drawn from I Cor. VII.</h3>

<p>Wherefore, with regard to clothing also, and all the remaining lumber of your self-elaboration,  the like pruning off and retrenchment of too redundant splendour must be the object of your care. For what boots it to exhibit in your <em>face</em> <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and unaffectedness, and a simplicity altogether worthy of the divine discipline, but to invest all the <em>other</em> parts of the body with the luxurious absurdities of pomps and delicacies? How intimate is the connection which these pomps have with the business of voluptuousness, and how they interfere with modesty, is easily discernible from the fact that it is by the allied aid of dress that they prostitute the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of personal comeliness: so plain is it that if (the pomps) be wanting, they render (that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>) bootless and thankless, as if it were disarmed and wrecked. On the other hand, if natural beauty fails, the supporting aid of outward embellishment supplies a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as it were, from its own inherent power.  Those times of life, in fact, which are at last blest with quiet and withdrawn into the harbour of modesty, the splendour and dignity of dress lure away (from that rest and that harbour), and <em>dis</em>quiet seriousness by seductions of appetite, which compensate for the chill of age by the provocative charms of apparel. First, then, blessed (sisters), (take heed) that you admit not to your use meretricious and prostitutionary garbs and garments: and, in the next place, if there are any of you whom the exigencies of riches, or birth, or past dignities, compel to appear in public so gorgeously arrayed as not to appear to have attained wisdom, take heed to temper an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of this kind; lest, under the pretext of necessity, you give the rein without stint to the indulgence of licence. For how will you be able to fulfil (the requirements of) humility, which our (school) profess,  if you do not keep within bounds  the enjoyment of your riches and elegancies, which tend so much to <q><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?</q> Now it has ever been the wont of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <em>exalt</em>, not to <em><a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a></em>. <q>Why, shall we not use what is our own?</q> Who prohibits your using it? Yet (it must be) in accordance with the apostle, who warns us <q>to use this world  as if we abuse it not; for the fashion  of this world  is passing away.</q> And <q>they who buy are so to act as if they possessed not.</q>  Why so? Because he had laid down the premiss, saying, <q>The time is wound up.</q>  If, then he shows plainly that even wives themselves are so to be had as if they be <em>not</em> had,  on account of the straits of the times, what would be his sentiments about these vain appliances of theirs? Why, are there not many, withal, who so <em>do</em>, and seal themselves up to eunuchhood for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>,  spontaneously relinquishing a pleasure so <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>,  and (as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>) permitted? Are there not some who prohibit to themselves (the use of) the very <q>creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  abstaining from wine and animal food, the enjoyments of which border upon no peril or solicitude; but they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to God the humility of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> even in the chastened use of food? Sufficiently, therefore, have you, too, used your riches and your delicacies; sufficiently have you cut down the fruits of your dowries, before (receiving) the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of saving disciplines. We are they <q>upon whom the ends of the ages have met, having ended their course.</q>  We have been <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before the world  was, (to arise) in the extreme end of the times.  And so we are trained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the purpose of chastising, and (so to say) emasculating, the world.  We are the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> &mdash; spiritual and carnal&mdash; of all things; for both in the spirit and in the flesh we circumcise worldly  principles.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10. Tertullian Refers Again to the Question of the Origin of All These Ornaments and Embellishments.</h3> 

<p>It was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, who showed the way to dye wools with the juices of herbs and the humours of conchs! It had escaped Him, when He was bidding the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> to come into being,  to issue a command for (the production of) purple and scarlet sheep! It was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, too, who devised by careful thought the manufactures of those very garments which, light and thin (in themselves), were to be heavy in price alone; God who produced such grand implements of gold for confining or parting the hair; God who introduced (the fashion of) finely-cut wounds for the ears, and set so high a value upon the tormenting of His own work and the tortures of innocent infancy, learning to suffer with its earliest breath, in order that from those scars of the body&mdash; born for the steel!&mdash; should hang I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what (precious) grains, which, as we may plainly see, the Parthians insert, in place of studs, upon their very shoes! And yet even the gold itself, the <q><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></q> of which carries you away, serves a certain race (so Gentile literature tells us) for chains! So <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is it that it is not intrinsic worth,  but rarity, which constitutes the goodness (of these things): the excessive labour, moreover, of working them with arts introduced by the means of the sinful <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who were the revealers withal of the material substances themselves, joined with their rarity, excited their costliness, and hence a <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> on the part of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to possess (that) costliness. But, if the self-same <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who disclosed both the material substances of this kind and their charms&mdash; of gold, I mean, and lustrous  stones&mdash; and taught men how to work them, and by and by instructed them, among their other (instructions), in (the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of) eyelid-powder and the dyeings of fleeces, have been condemned by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> tells us, how shall we please God while we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the <em>things</em> of those (<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>) who, on these accounts, have provoked the <em><a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a></em> and the <em>vengeance</em> of God?</p>

<p>Now, granting that God did foresee these things; that God permitted them; that Esaias finds fault with no garment of purple,  represses no coil,  reprobates no crescent-shaped neck ornaments;  still let <em>us</em> not, as the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> do, flatter ourselves with thinking that God is merely a Creator, not likewise a Downlooker on His own creatures. For how far more usefully and cautiously shall we act, if we hazard the presumption that all these things were indeed provided  at the beginning and placed in the world  by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that there should now be means of putting to the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> the discipline of His servants, in order that the licence of <em>using</em> should be the means whereby the experimental trials of <em>continence</em> should be conducted? Do not wise heads of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> purposely offer and permit some things to their servants  in order to try whether and how they will use the things thus permitted; whether (they will do so) with honesty, or with moderation? But how far more praiseworthy (the servant) who abstains entirely; who has a wholesome <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>  even of his lord's indulgence! Thus, therefore, the apostle too: <q>All things,</q> says he, <q>are lawful, but not all are expedient.</q>  How much more easily will he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>  what is <em>un</em>lawful who has a reverent dread  of what is <em>lawful</em>?</p>

<h3>Chapter 11. Christian Women, Further, Have Not the Same Causes for Appearing in Public, and Hence for Dressing in Fine Array as Gentiles. On the Contrary, Their Appearance Should Always Distinguish Them from Such</h3>

<p>Moreover, what causes have you for appearing in public in excessive grandeur, removed as you are from the occasions which call for such exhibitions? For you neither make the circuit of the temples, nor demand (to be present at) public shows, nor have any acquaintance with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> days of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Now it is for the sake of all these public gatherings, and of much seeing and being seen, that all pomps (of dress) are exhibited before the public eye; either for the purpose of transacting the trade of voluptuousness, or else of inflating <q><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <em>You</em>, however, have no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of appearing in public, except such as is serious. Either some brother who is sick is visited, or else the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is offered, or else the word of God is dispensed. Whichever of these you like to name is a business of sobriety  and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, requiring no extraordinary attire, with (studious) arrangement and (wanton) negligence.  And if the requirements of Gentile friendships and of kindly offices call you, why not go forth clad in your own armour; (and) all the more, in that (you have to go) to such as are strangers to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? So that between the handmaids of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> there may be a difference; so that you may be an example to them, and they may be edified in you; so that (as the apostle says) <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be magnified in your body.</q>  But magnified He is in the <em>body</em> through modesty: of course, too, through attire suitable to modesty. Well, but it is urged by some, <q>Let not the Name be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> in us,  if we make any derogatory change from our old style and dress.</q> Let us, then, not abolish our old <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>! let us maintain the same character, if we must maintain the same appearance (as before); and then <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the nations will not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>! A grand <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is that by which it is said, <q>Ever since she became a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, she walks in poorer garb!</q> Will you <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to appear poorer, from the time that you have been made more <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>; and <em>fouler</em>,  from the time when you have been made more clean? Is it according to the decree  of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, or according to the decree of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that it becomes <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to walk?</p>

<h3>Chapter 12. Such Outward Adornments Meretricious, and Therefore Unsuitable to Modest Women</h3>

<p>Let us only wish that we may be no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for just <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>! But how much more provocative of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is it that you, who are called modesty's priestesses, should appear in public decked and painted out after the manner of the <em>im</em>modest? Else, (if you so do,) what inferiority would the poor unhappy victims of the public <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> have (beneath you)? Whom, albeit some <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were (formerly) wont to restrain them from (the use of) matrimonial and matronly decorations, now, at all events, the daily increasing depravity of the age  has raised so nearly to an equality with all the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, that the difficulty is to distinguish them. And yet, even the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> suggest (to us the reflection), that meretricious attractivenesses of form are invariably conjoined with and appropriate  to bodily prostitution. That powerful state  which presides over  the seven mountains and very many waters, has merited from the Lord the appellation of a prostitute.  But what kind of garb is the instrumental mean of her comparison with that appellation? She sits, to be sure, <q>in purple, and scarlet, and gold, and precious stone.</q> How accursed are the things without (the aid of) which an accursed prostitute could not have been described! It was the fact that Thamar <q>had painted out and adorned herself</q> that led Judah to regard her as a harlot,  and thus, because she was hidden beneath her <q>veil,</q>&mdash; the quality of her garb belying her as if she had been a harlot&mdash;he judged (her to be one), and addressed and bargained with (her as such). Whence we gather an additional confirmation of the lesson, that provision must be made in every way against all immodest associations  and suspicions. For why is the integrity of a chaste mind defiled by its neighbour's suspicion? Why is a thing from which I am averse hoped for in me? Why does not my garb pre-announce my character, to prevent my spirit from being wounded by shamelessness through (the channel of) my ears? Grant that it be lawful to assume the appearance of a modest <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>:  to assume that of an <em>im</em>modest is, at all events, <em>not</em> lawful.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13. It is Not Enough that God Know Us to Be Chaste: We Must Seem So Before Men. Especially in These Times of Persecution We Must Inure Our Bodies to the Hardships Which They May Not Improbably Be Called to Suffer</h3>

<p>Perhaps some (<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>) will say: <q>To me it is not necessary to be approved by men; for I do not require the testimony of men:  God is the inspector of the heart.</q>  (That) we all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; provided, however, we remember what the same (God) has said through the apostle: <q>Let your probity appear before men.</q>  For what purpose, except that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> may have no access at all to you, or that you may be an example and testimony to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? Else, what is (that): <q>Let your works shine?</q>  Why, moreover, does the Lord call us the light of the world; why has He compared us to a city built upon a mountain;  if we do not shine in (the midst of) darkness, and stand eminent amid them who are sunk down? If you hide your lamp beneath a bushel,  you must necessarily be left quite in darkness, and be run against by many. The things which make us luminaries of the world are these&mdash; our good works. What is <em>good</em>, moreover, provided it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and full, loves not darkness: it joys in being seen,  and exults over the very pointings which are made at it. To <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> modesty it is not enough to <em>be</em> so, but to <em>seem</em> so too. For so great ought its plenitude to be, that it may flow out from the mind to the garb, and burst out from the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to the outward appearance; so that even from the outside it may gaze, as it were, upon its own furniture, &mdash; (a furniture) such as to be suited to retain <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as its inmate perpetually. For such delicacies as tend by their softness and effeminacy to unman the manliness  of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are to be discarded. Otherwise, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether the wrist that has been wont to be surrounded with the palmleaf-like bracelet will endure till it grow into the numb hardness of its own chain! I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether the leg that has rejoiced in the anklet will suffer itself to be squeezed into the gyve! I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the neck, beset with pearl and emerald nooses, will give no room to the broadsword! Wherefore, blessed (sisters), let us meditate on hardships, and we shall not feel them; let us abandon luxuries, and we shall not regret them. Let us stand ready to endure every <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, having nothing which we may <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to leave behind. It is these things which are the bonds which retard our hope. Let us cast away earthly ornaments if we desire heavenly. Love not gold; in which (one substance) are branded all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. You ought to <em><a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a></em> what ruined your fathers; what was adored by them who were forsaking God.  Even <em>then</em> (we find) gold is food for the fire.  But <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> always, and now more than ever, pass their times not in gold but in iron: the stoles of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> are (now) preparing: the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are to carry us are (now) being awaited! Do you go forth (to meet them) already arrayed in the cosmetics and ornaments of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; drawing your whiteness from simplicity, your ruddy hue from modesty; painting your eyes with bashfulness, and your mouth with silence; implanting in your ears the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; fitting on your necks the yoke of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Submit your head to your husbands, and you will be enough adorned. Busy your hands with spinning; keep your feet at home; and you will <q>please</q> better than (by arraying yourselves) in gold. Clothe yourselves with the silk of uprightness, the fine linen of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, the purple of modesty. Thus painted, you will have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as your Lover!</p>
