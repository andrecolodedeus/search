<h1>On the Baptism of Heretics</h1>

<p> <em>The Seventh Council of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> Under Cyprian.</em> </p>

<p> <em>Concerning the Baptism of Heretics. The Judgment of Eighty-Seven Bishops on the Baptism of Heretics.</em></p>

<p>Prooemium.&mdash; When Stephen, Bishop of Rome, Had by His Letters Condemned the Decrees of the African Council on the Baptism of Heretics, Cyprian Lost No Time in Holding Another Council at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> with a Greater Number of Bishops. Having Therefore Summoned Eighty-Seven Bishops from Africa, Numidia, and Mauritania, Who Assembled at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> in the Kalends of September, a.d. 258, This Third Council on the Same Matter of Baptism Was Then Celebrated; At the Beginning of Which, After, the Letters on Either Side Had Been Read, Cyprian, by Implication, Condemns the Assumption of Stephen. </p>

<p>When, in the kalends of September, a great many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from the provinces of Africa, Numidia, and Mauritania, had met together at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and a considerable part of the congregation who were also present; and when the letter of Jubaianus written to Cyprian had been read, as also the reply of Cyprian to Jubaianus, about <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and what the same Jubaianus had subsequently rejoined to Cyprian,&mdash; Cyprian said: You have heard, my dearly beloved colleagues, what Jubaianus our co-bishop has written to me, taking counsel of my poor intelligence concerning the unlawful and profane <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, as well as what I wrote in answer to him, decreeing, to wit, what we have once and again and frequently determined, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Moreover, another letter of Jubaianus has also been read to you, wherein, replying, in accordance with his sincere and religious devotion, to my letter, he not only acquiesced in what I had said, but, confessing that he had been instructed thereby, he returned thanks for it. It remains, that upon this same matter each of us should bring forward what we think, judging no man, nor rejecting any one from the right of communion, if he should think differently from us. For neither does any of us set himself up as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>,  nor by tyrannical terror does any compel his colleague to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>; since every <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, according to the allowance of his liberty and power, has his own proper right of judgment, and can no more be judged by another than he himself can judge another.  But let us all wait for the judgment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who is the only one that has the power both of preferring us in the government of His Church, and of judging us in our conduct there.</p>

<p>Caecilius of Bilta  said: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and none out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This one will be here, where there is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> hope and the certain <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For thus it is written: <q>One <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one hope, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note054623"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;4:5</a></span> not among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, where there is no hope, and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is false, where all things are carried on by lying; where a <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniac</a> exorcises; where one  whose mouth and words send forth a cancer puts the sacramental interrogation;  the faithless gives <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> bestows pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> baptizes in the name of Christ; he who is cursed of God blesses; he who is dead promises life; he who is unpeaceful gives peace; the blasphemer calls upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the profane person administers the office of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> person establishes an altar. In addition to all these things, there is also this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> dare to celebrate the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>; or else let those who stand by them say that all these things concerning <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are false. Behold to what kind of things the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is compelled  to consent, and is constrained without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, without pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, to hold communion. And this thing, brethren, we ought to flee from and avoid, and to separate ourselves from so great a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and to hold one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which is granted by the Lord to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone.</p>

<p>Primus of Misgirpa  said: I decide, that every man who comes to us from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For in vain does he think that he has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> there, seeing that there is no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> save the one and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; because not only is God one, but the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is one, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is one, wherein stands the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and the rest. For whatever is done without, has no effect of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> from Adrumetum  said: They who approve the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> make void our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<p>Novatus of Thamugada  said: Although we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> give <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> concerning the saving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, still we ought to declare our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics who come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and appear to have been <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the everlasting fountain; and therefore, according to the testimony of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and according to the decree of our colleagues, men of most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory, that all schismatics and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who are converted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and moreover, that those who appeared to have been ordained must be received among lay people.</p>

<p>Nemesianus of Thubunae  said: That the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics bestow is not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one, is everywhere declared in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, since their very leading men are false Christs and <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, as the Lord says by Solomon: <q>He who trusts in that which is false, he feeds the winds; and the very same, moreover, follows the flight of birds. For he forsakes the ways of his own vineyard, he has wandered from the paths of his own little field. But he walks through pathless places, and dry, and a land destined for thirst; moreover, he gathers together fruitless things in his hands.</q>  And again: <q>Abstain from strange water, and from the fountain of another do not drink, that you may live a long time; also that the years of life may be added to you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note054632"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse19">Proverbs 9:19</a></span> And in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> spoke with His divine voice, saying, <q>Unless a man be born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note054633"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John 3:5</a></span> This is the Spirit which from the beginning was borne over the waters; for neither can the Spirit operate without the water, nor the water without the Spirit. Certain people therefore interpret for themselves ill, when they say that by imposition of the hand they receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and are thus received, when it is manifest that they ought to be born again in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by both <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Then indeed they will be able to be sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as says the apostle: <q>Taking care to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one Spirit, as you have been called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, one God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note054634"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse3">Ephesians 4:3-6</a></span> All these things speaks the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  And again, in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the Lord says: <q>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit; because God is a Spirit, and he is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note054636"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse6">John 3:6</a></span> Therefore, whatsoever things all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics do are carnal, as the apostle says: <q>For the works of the flesh are manifest, which are, fornications, uncleannesses, incest, idolatries, witchcrafts, hatreds, contentions, jealousy, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, divisions, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and the like to these; concerning which have told you before, as I also foretell you now, that whoever do such things shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note054637"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians 5:19-21</a></span> And thus the apostle condemns, with all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, those also who <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> division, that is, schismatics and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Unless therefore they receive saving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is one, they cannot be saved, but will be condemned with the carnal in the judgment of the Lord Christ.</p>

<p>Januarius of Lambesis  said: According to the authority  of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, I decree that all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and so admitted into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church.</p>

<p>Lucius of Castra Galbae  said: Since the Lord in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> said, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> of the earth: but if the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> should have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out of doors, and to be trodden under foot of men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note054641"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse13">Matthew 5:13</a></span> And again, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, sending His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, He gave them charge, saying, <q>All power is given unto me, in heaven and in earth. Go and teach all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note054642"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse18">Matthew 28:18-19</a></span> Since, therefore, it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>&mdash; that is, the enemies of Christ&mdash; have not the sound confession of the sacrament; moreover, that schismatics cannot season others with spiritual wisdom, since they themselves, by departing from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is one, having lost the savour, have become contrary to it&mdash;let it be done as it is written, <q>The house of those that are contrary to the law owes a cleansing.</q>  And it is a consequence that those who, having been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by people who are contrary to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are polluted, must first be cleansed, and then at length be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<p>Crescens of Cirta  said: In such an assembly of most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, as the letters of our most beloved Cyprian to Jubaianus and also to Stephen have been read, containing in them so much of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> testimonies which descend from the divinely made Scriptures, that with reason we ought, all being made one by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to consent to them; I judge that all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics who wish to come to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, shall not be allowed to enter without they have first been exorcised and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; with the exception of those indeed who may previously have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and these in such a way that they may be reconciled to the penitence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the imposition of hands.</p>

<p>Nicomedes of Segermae  said: My opinion is this, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, for the reason that among sinners without they can obtain no remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>Munnulus  of Girba  said: The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of our Mother  the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, brethren, has always remained and still remains with us, and even especially in the Trinity of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as our Lord says, <q>Go and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note054649"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a></span> Since, then, we manifestly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have not either Father, or Son, or <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, they ought, when they come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> our Mother, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to be born again and to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; that the cancer which they had, and the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of damnation, and the witchery of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, may be sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and heavenly layer.</p>

<p>Secundinus of Cedias  said: Since our Lord Christ says, <q>He who is not with me is against me; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note054651"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse30">Matthew 12:30</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John the apostle</a> calls those who depart from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Antichrists&mdash; undoubtedly enemies of Christ&mdash; any such as are called Antichrists cannot minister the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of saving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And therefore I think that those who flee from the snares of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by us, who are called friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of His condescension.</p>

<p>Felix of Bagai  said: As, when the blind leads the blind, they fall together into the ditch; so, when the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> baptizes a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, they fall together into death. And therefore a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and made alive, lest we who are alive should hold communion with the dead.</p>

<p>Polianus of Mileum  said: It is right that a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church.</p>

<p>Theogenes of Hippo Regius  said: According to the sacrament of God's heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which we have received, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church.</p>

<p>Dativus of Badis  said: We, as far as in us lies, do not hold communion with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, unless they have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and have received remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>Successus of Abbir Germaniciana  said: Heretics can either do nothing, or they can do all. If they can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, they can also bestow the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But if they cannot give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, because they have not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, neither can they spiritually <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. Therefore we judge that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunatus of Tuccaboris  said: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> the Father and Creator, built His Church upon a rock,  not upon <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; and gave the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, not to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Wherefore they who are without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and, standing in opposition to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, disperse His sheep and flock, cannot <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, being without.</p>

<p>Sedatus of Tuburbo  said: In the degree in which water sanctified in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, washes away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; in that degree, if infected with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> discourse as with a cancer, it heaps up <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Wherefore we must endeavour with all peaceful powers, that no one infected and stained with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> refuse to receive the single and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, by which whosoever is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, shall become an alien from the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. Privatianus of Sufetula  said: Let him who says that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, say first who rounded <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. For if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it also may have the divine indulgence. But if it is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how can it either have the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or confer it upon any one?</p>

<p>Privatus of Sufes  said: He who approves the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, what else does he do than communicate with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>?</p>

<p>Hortensianus of Lares  said: Let either these presumptuous ones,  or those who favour <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, consider how many baptisms there are. We claim for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not except in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Or how can they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> any one in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whom Christ Himself declares to be His adversaries?</p>

<p>Cassius of Macomadae  said: Since there cannot be two baptisms, he who yields <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> takes it away from himself. I judge therefore that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, lamentable and corrupt, must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> when they begin to come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and that when washed by the sacred and divine washing, and illuminated by the light of life, they may be received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not as enemies, but as made peaceful; not as foreigners, but as of the household of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Lord; not as children of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, but as sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; except those who once faithful have been supplanted, and have passed over from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the darkness of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but that these must be restored by the imposition of hands.</p>

<p>Another Januarius of Vicus Caesaris  said: If <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> does not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, much more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not consent to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; and therefore we stand by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in which we preside, that, claiming her <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for herself alone, we should <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<p>Another Secundinus of Carpi  said: Are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> or not? If they are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, why are they not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>? If they are not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, how come they to make <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? Or whither will tend the Lord's discourse, when He says, <q>He that is not with me is against me, and he who gathers not with me scatters? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note054667"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse30">Matthew 12:30</a></span> Whence it appears plain that upon strange children, and on the offspring of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> cannot descend only by imposition of hands, since it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<p>Victoricus of Thabraca  said: If <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are allowed to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> and to give remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, wherefore do we brand them with <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> and call them <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>?</p>

<p>Another Felix of Uthina  said: Nobody doubts, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> presumption is not able to do so much as the adorable and venerable majesty of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. Therefore, remembering the danger, we ought not only to observe this also, but moreover to confirm it by the voice of all of us, that all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who come to the bosom of Mother Church should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that thus the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> mind that has been polluted by a long decay, purged by the sanctification of the layer, may be reformed for the better.</p>

<p>Quietus of Baruch  said: We who live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ought to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> with careful observance those things which before have been foretold for our instruction. For it is written in Solomon: <q>He that is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> from the dead, (and again touches the dead, ) what avails his washing? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note054672"><a href="../bible/sir034.htm#verse25">Sirach 34:25</a></span> which certainly speaks of those who are washed by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and of those that wash them. For if those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among them obtain by remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, why do they come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? But if from a dead person no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is received, and therefore, acknowledging their previous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, they return to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with penitence, they ought to be sanctified with the one vital <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>Castus of Sicca  said: He who with contempt of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> presumes to follow custom, is either <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> and malignant in respect of his brethren to whom the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is revealed, or is ungrateful in respect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whose inspiration His Church is instructed.</p>

<p>Euchratius of Thenae  said: God and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, teaching the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> with His own mouth, has entirely completed our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and the rule of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> law, saying: <q>Go and teach all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note054675"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse18">Matthew 28:18</a></span> Thus the false and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> must be rejected by us, and refuted with all detestation, from whose month is expressed poison, not life, not celestial <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the Trinity.  And therefore it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the sound and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in order that, being purified from the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of their presumption, they may be reformed by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>Libosus of Vaga  said: In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the Lord says, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note054678"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John 14:6</a></span> He said not, I am the custom. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> being manifest, let custom yield to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; so that, although for the past any one was not in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, let him now begin to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them. </p>

<p>Lucius of Thebeste  said: I determine that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> and unrighteous <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who with various words tear asunder the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and adorable words of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, are to be accursed, and therefore that they must be exorcised and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<p>Eugenius of Ammedera  said: And I determine the same&mdash; that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<p>Also another Felix of Amaccora  said: And I myself, following the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>,  judge that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and, moreover, those also who contend that they have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among the schismatics. For if, according to Christ's warning, our font is private to us, let all the adversaries of our Church understand that it cannot be for another. Nor can He who is the Shepherd of the one flock give the saving water to two peoples. And therefore it is plain that neither <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> nor schismatics can receive anything heavenly, seeing that they dare to receive from men who are sinners, and from those who are external to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. When there is no place for the giver, assuredly there is no profit for the receiver.</p>

<p>Also another Januarius of Muzzuli  said: I am surprised, since all confess that there is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, that all do not perceive the unity of the same <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> are two things, and different things. If <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, we have it not; but if we have it, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> cannot have it. But there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone possesses the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since she alone possesses both the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>Adelphius of Thasvalte  said: Certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> without reason impugn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by false and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> words, in saying that we rebaptize, when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not rebaptize <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but baptizes them.</p>

<p>Demetrius of Leptiminus  said: We maintain one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, because we demand for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> alone her own property. But they who say that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and legitimately <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, are themselves the people who make not one, but many baptisms. For since <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> are many, according to their number will be reckoned baptisms.</p>

<p>Vincentius of Thibaris  said: We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are worse than <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. If, therefore, being converted, they should wish to come to the Lord, we have assuredly the rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which the Lord by His divine precept commanded to His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, saying, <q>Go, lay on hands in my name, expel <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</q>  And in another place: <q>Go and teach the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note054689"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew 28:19</a></span> Therefore first of all by imposition of hands in exorcism, secondly by the regeneration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, they may then come to the promise of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Otherwise I think it ought not to be done.</p>

<p>Marcus of Mactaris  said: It is not to be wondered at if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, enemies, and impugners of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> claim to themselves a matter in the power and condescension of others. But it is to be wondered at, that some of us, prevaricators of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, support <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and oppose themselves to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Therefore we decree that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<p>Sattius of Sicilibba  said: If to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted, they come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without reason. For since, in the day of judgment, they are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are punished, there is nothing which the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> can <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> from Christ's judgment, if they have already obtained remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>Victor of Gor  said: Since <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not remitted  save in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he who admits a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> to communion without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> does two things against reason: he does not cleanse the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and he befouls the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</p>

<p>Aurelius of Utica  said: Since the apostle says that we are not to communicate with other people's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, what else does he do but communicate with other people's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, who holds communion with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> without the Church's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>? And therefore I judge that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that they may receive forgiveness of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and thus communion may be had with them.</p>

<p>Iambus of Germaniciana  said: They who approve of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, disapprove of ours, in denying that they who are, I will not say washed, but befouled, outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>Lucianus of Rucuma  said: It is written, <q>And God saw the light, that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and divided between the light and the darkness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note054697"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse4">Genesis 1:4</a></span> If there can be agreement between light and darkness, there may be something in common between us and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Therefore I determine that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<p>Pelagianus of Luperciana  said: It is written, <q>Either the Lord is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note054699"><a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#verse21">1 Kings 18:21</a></span> Therefore in the present case also, either the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. On the other hand, if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, how can the Church's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> be among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>?</p>

<p>Jader of Midila  said: We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is but one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and therefore we ought not to receive a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> unless he has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among us; lest he should think that he has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> out of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>Also another Felix of Marazana  said: There is one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which alone has the right to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>.</p>

<p>Paulus of Obba  said: It does not disturb me if any man does not assert the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since the apostle says, <q>For what if some of them have fallen away from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Has their unbelief made the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of God of no effect? By no means. For God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but every man a liar.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note054703"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse3">Romans 3:3-4</a></span> But if God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, how can the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> be among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, among whom God is not?</p>

<p>Pomponius of Dionysiana  said: It is evident that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> and give remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, seeing that they have not power to be able to loose or to bind anything on earth.</p>

<p>Venantius of Timisa  said: If a husband, going into foreign parts, had commended his wife to the guardianship of his friend, that friend would take care of her who was commended to him with all possible diligence, that her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> should not be corrupted by any one. Christ the Lord and our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, going to His Father, has commended to us His bride. Shall we guard her incorrupt and inviolate, or shall we betray her integrity and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> to adulterers and corrupters? For he who makes the Church's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> common to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, betrays the spouse of Christ to adulterers.</p>

<p>Ahymnus of Ausvaga  said: We have received one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and that same we maintain and practise. But he who says that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> also may lawfully <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, makes two baptisms.</p>

<p>Saturninus of Victoriana  said: If <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> may <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, they who do unlawful things are excused and defended; nor do I see why either Christ should have called them adversaries, or the apostle should have called them Antichrists.</p>

<p>Saturninus  of Thucca  said: The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, although they worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, do yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and confess a supreme God  as Father and Creator. Against Him <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> blasphemes, and some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> do not blush to approve the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>. How do such <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> either observe or vindicate God's <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, who do not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> God's enemies, and hold communion with them as they are!</p>

<p>Marcellus of Zama  said: Since <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not remitted  save in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he who does not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> holds communion with a sinner.</p>

<p>Irenaeus of Ululi  said: If the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, for the reason that he is said to be already <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, it is the greater <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<p>Donatus of Cibaliana  said: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> one Church and her one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. If there is any who says that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, he must first show and prove that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is among them.</p>

<p>Zosimus of Tharassa  said: When a revelation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is made, let <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> give place to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; because Peter also, who previously <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, yielded to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> when he preached the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. </p>

<p>Julianus of Telepte  said: It is written, <q>No man can receive anything unless it have been given him from heaven.</q>  If <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is from heaven, it can also give <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<p>Faustus of Timida Regia  said: Let not them who are in favour of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> flatter themselves. He who interferes with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on behalf of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, makes them <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and us <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<p>Geminius of Furni  said: Some of our colleagues may prefer <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to themselves, they cannot to us: and therefore what we have once determined we maintain&mdash; that we <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those who come to us from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<p>Rogatianus of Nova  said: Christ instituted the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. How can the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> have the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ?</p>

<p>Therapius of Bulla  said: He who concedes and betrays the Church's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, what else has he been to the spouse of Christ than a Judas?</p>

<p>Also another Lucius of Membresa  said: It is written, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hears not a sinner.</q>  How can a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> who is a sinner be heard in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>?</p>

<p>Also another Felix of Bussacene  said: In the matter of receiving <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> without the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, let no one prefer custom to reason and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because reason and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> always exclude custom. </p>

<p>Another Saturninus of Avitini  said: If <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> can give to any one the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> also are able to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, for they are called antichrists.</p>

<p>Quintus of Aggya:  He can give something who has something. But what can <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> give, who, it is plain, have nothing?</p>

<p>Another Julianus of Marcelliana  said: If a man can serve two masters, God and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> also can serve two masters, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>.</p>

<p>Tenax of Horrea Caeliae  said: Baptism is one, but it is the Church's. Where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not there, there can be no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<p>Another Victor of Assuri  said: It is written, that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one, and Christ is one, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is one, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is one.</q>  How, therefore, can any one be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> there, where <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the one Church is not?</p>

<p>Donatulus of Capse  said: And I also have always thought this, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who can obtain nothing without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when they are converted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<p>Verulus  of Rusiccada  said: A man who is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> cannot give what he has not; much more a schismatic, who has lost what he once had.</p>

<p>Pudentianus of Cuiculis  said: The novelty of my episcopal office,  beloved brethren, has caused me to await what my elders should judge. For it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> have nothing, nor can have any thing. And thus, if any one comes from them, it is most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> decreed that they must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<p>Peter of Hippo Diarrhytus  said: Since there is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it is manifest that one cannot be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And therefore I judge that those who have been dipped in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, when they come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<p>Also another Lucius of Ausafa  said: According to the direction of my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as there is one God and Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and one Christ, and one hope, and one Spirit, and one Church, there ought also to be one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And therefore I say, that if any thing had been set on foot or accomplished by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, it ought to be rescinded, and that those who come thence must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>Also another Felix of Gurgites  said: I judge that, according to the precepts of the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, he who is unlawfully <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when he wishes to take refuge in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, should obtain the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> where it is lawfully given.</p>

<p>Pusillus of Lamasba  said: I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is no saving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> except in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Whatsoever is apart from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is a pretence.</p>

<p>Salvianus of Gazaufala  said: It is certain that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have nothing, and therefore they come to us that they may receive what they have not.</p>

<p>Honoratus of Thucca  said: Since Christ is the Truth, we ought rather to follow <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> than custom; so that we should sanctify <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> with the Church's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, seeing that they come to us for the reason that they could receive nothing without.</p>

<p>Victor of Octavum  said: As yourselves also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, I have not long been appointed a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and I therefore waited for the decision  of my predecessors. I therefore think this, that as many as come from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> should undoubtedly be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<p>Clarus of Mascula  said: The sentence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is plain, when He sent His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and accorded to them alone the power given to Him by His Father; and to them we have succeeded, governing the Lord's Church with the same power,  and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. And therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who neither have power without, nor have the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are able to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> no one with His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<p>Secundianus of Thambei  said: We ought not to deceive <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> by our presumption; so that they who have not been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and have not obtained by this means remissions of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, when the day of judgment shall come, should impute to us that through us they were not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and did not obtain the indulgence of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>. On which account, since there is one Church and one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, when they are converted to us they should obtain, together with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Church's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> also.</p>

<p>Also another Aurelius of Chullabi  said: <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John the apostle</a> laid it down in his epistle, saying: <q>If any one come unto you, and have not the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, receive him not into your house, and say not to him, Hail. For he that says to him, Hail, partakes with his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>.</q>  How can such be rashly admitted into God's house, who are prohibited from being admitted into our private dwelling? Or how can we hold communion with them without the Church's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, to whom, if we should only say Hail, we are partakers of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>?</p>

<p>Litteus  of Gemelli  said: If the blind lead the blind, both fall into the ditch, Since, then, it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> cannot give light to any, as being themselves blind, their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> does not avail.</p>

<p>Natalis of O&euml;a  said: As well I who am present, as Pompey  of Sabrata,  as also Dioga of Leptis Magna  &mdash; who, absent indeed in body, but present in spirit, have given me charge&mdash; judge the same as our colleagues, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> cannot hold communion with us, unless they shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<p>Junius of Neapolis  said: From the judgment which we once determined on I do not recede, that we should <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian of Carthage</a> said: The letter which was written to our colleague Jubaianus very fully expresses my opinion, that, according to evangelical and apostolic testimony, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who are called adversaries of Christ and Antichrists, when they come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that they may be made of adversaries, friends, and of Antichrists, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. </p>
