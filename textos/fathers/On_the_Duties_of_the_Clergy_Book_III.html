<h1>On the Duties of the Clergy (Book III)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1.</h2>

<p><strong>We are taught by David and Solomon how to take counsel with our own heart. Scipio is not to be accounted prime author of the saying which is ascribed to him. The writer proves what glorious things the holy prophets accomplished in their time of quiet, and shows, by examples of their and others' leisure moments, that a just man is never alone in trouble.</strong></p>

<p>1. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> David taught us that we should go about in our heart as though in a large house; that we should hold converse with it as with some trusty companion. He spoke to himself, and conversed with himself, as these words show: <q>I said, I will take heed to my ways.</q>  Solomon his son also said: <q>Drink water out of your own vessels, and out of the springs of your wells; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note340577"><a href="../bible/pro005.htm#verse15">Proverbs&nbsp;5:15</a></span> that is: use your own counsel. For: <q>Counsel in the heart of a man is as deep waters.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340578"><a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse5">Proverbs&nbsp;20:5</a></span> <q>Let no stranger,</q> it says, <q>share it with you. Let the fountain of your water be your own, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with your wife who is yours from your youth. Let the loving hind and pleasant doe converse with you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340579"><a href="../bible/pro005.htm#verse17">Proverbs&nbsp;5:17-19</a></span> </p>

<p>2. Scipio,  therefore, was not the first to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he was not alone when he was alone, or that he was least at leisure when he was at leisure. For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it before him, who, when silent, was crying out; <span class="stiki" id="note340581"><a href="../bible/exo014.htm#verse16">Exodus&nbsp;14:16</a></span> who, when he stood at ease, was fighting, nay, not merely fighting but triumphing over enemies whom he had not come near. So much was he at ease, that others held up his hands; yet he was no less active than others, for he with his hands at ease was overcoming the enemy, whom they that were in the battle could not conquer. <span class="stiki" id="note340582"><a href="../bible/exo017.htm#verse11">Exodus&nbsp;17:11</a></span> Thus <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in his silence spoke, and in his ease laboured hard. And were his labours greater than his times of quiet, who, being in the mount for forty days, received the whole law? <span class="stiki" id="note340583"><a href="../bible/exo024.htm#verse17">Exodus&nbsp;24:17</a></span> And in that solitude there was One not far away to speak with him. Whence also David says: <q>I will hear what the Lord God will say within me.</q>  How much greater a thing is it for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to speak with any one, than for a man to speak with himself!</p>

<p>3. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> passed by and their shadows cured the sick. <span class="stiki" id="note340585"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;5:15-16</a></span> Their garments were touched and health was granted.</p>

<p>4. Elijah spoke the word, and the rain ceased and fell not on the earth for three years and six months.  Again he spoke, and the barrel of meal failed not, and the cruse of oil wasted not the whole time of that long famine. </p>

<p>5. But&mdash; as many delight in warfare&mdash; which is the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, to bring a battle to an end by the strength of a great army, or, by merits before God alone? Elisha rested in one place while the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> waged a great <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the people of our fathers, and was adding to its terrors by various treacherous plans, and was endeavouring to catch them in an ambush. But the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> found out all their preparations, and being by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God present everywhere in mental vigour, he told the thoughts of their enemies to his countrymen, and warned them of what places to beware. And when this was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the king of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, he sent an army and shut in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. Elisha <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> and caused all of them to be struck with blindness, and made those who had come to besiege him enter <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> as captives. </p>

<p>6. Let us compare this leisure of his with that of others.  Other men for the sake of rest are wont to withdraw their minds from business, and to retire from the company and companionship of men; to seek the retirement of the country or the solitude of the fields, or in the city to give their minds a rest and to enjoy peace and quietness. But Elisha was ever active. In solitude he divided Jordan on passing over it, so that the lower part flowed down, while the upper returned to its source. On Carmel he promises the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who so far had had no child, that a son now unhoped for should be born to her.  He raises the dead to life,  he corrects the bitterness of the food, and makes it to be sweet by mixing meal with it.  Having distributed ten loaves to the people for food, he gathered up the fragments that were left after they had been filled.  He makes the iron head of the axe, which had fallen off and was sunk deep in the river Jordan, to swim by putting the wooden handle in the water.  He changes <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> for cleanness,  drought for rain,  famine for plenty. </p>

<p>7. When can the upright man be alone, since he is always with God? When is he left forsaken who is never separated from Christ? <q>Who,</q> it says, <q>shall separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ? I am confident that neither death nor life nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> shall do so.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340598"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse35">Romans&nbsp;8:35,&nbsp;38</a></span> And when can he be deprived of his labour who never can be deprived of his merits, wherein his labour receives its crown? By what places is he limited to whom the whole world of riches is a possession? By what judgment is he confined who is never blamed by any one? For he is <q>as unknown yet well known, as dying and behold he lives, as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all things.</q>  For the upright man regards nothing but what is consistent and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. And so although he seems poor to another, he is rich to himself, for his worth is taken not at the value of the things which are temporal, but of the things which are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p><strong>The discussions among <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> about the comparison between what is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and what is useful have nothing to do with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. For with them nothing is useful which is not just. What are the duties of perfection, and what are ordinary duties? The same words often suit different things in different ways. Lastly, a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man never seeks his own advantage at the cost of another's disadvantage, but rather is always on the lookout for what is useful to others.</strong></p>

<p>8. As we have already spoken about the two former subjects, wherein we discussed what is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and what is useful, there follows now the question whether we ought to compare what is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and useful together, and to ask which we must follow. For, as we have already discussed the matter as to whether a thing is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and in another place whether it is useful or useless, so here some think we ought to find out whether a thing is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> or useful. </p>

<p>9. I am induced to do this, lest I should seem to be allowing that these two are mutually opposed to one another, when I have already shown them to be one. For I said that nothing can be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> but what is useful, and nothing can be useful but what is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>.  For we do not follow the wisdom of the flesh, whereby the usefulness that consists in an abundance of money is held to be of most value, but we follow that wisdom which is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby those things which are greatly valued in this world are counted but as loss.</p>

<p>10. For this <span class="greek">&#x03C7;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03C1;&#x03B8;&#x03C9;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;</span>, which is duty carried out entirely and in perfection, starts from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> source of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.  On this follows another, or ordinary duty. This shows by its name that no hard or extraordinary practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is involved, for it can be common to very many. The desire to save money is the usual practice with many. To enjoy a well-prepared banquet and a pleasant meal is a general habit; but to fast or to use self-restraint is the practice of but few, and not to be desirous of another's goods is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> rarely found. On the other hand, to wish to deprive another of his property&mdash; and not to be content with one's due&mdash; here one will find many to keep company with one. Those (the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> would say) are primary duties&mdash; these ordinary.  The primary are found but with few, the ordinary with the many.</p>

<p>11. Again, the same words often have a different meaning. For instance, we call God good and a man good; but it bears in each case quite a different meaning.  We call God just in one sense, man in another. So, too, there is a difference in meaning when we call God wise and a man wise. This we are taught in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Be perfect even as your Father Who is in heaven is perfect.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340605"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse48">Matthew&nbsp;5:48</a></span> I read again that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was perfect and yet not perfect. For when he said: <q>Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340606"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse12">Philippians&nbsp;3:12</a></span> Immediately he added: <q>We, then, that are perfect.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340607"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> There is a twofold form of perfection, the one having but ordinary, the other the highest worth. The one availing here, the other hereafter. The one in accordance with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> powers, the other with the perfection of the world to come. But God is just through all, wise above all, perfect in all.</p>

<p>12. There is also diversity even among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> themselves. Daniel, of whom it was said: <q>Who is wiser than Daniel?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340608"><a href="../bible/eze028.htm#verse3">Ezekiel&nbsp;28:3</a></span> was wise in a different sense to what others are. The same may be said of Solomon, who was filled with wisdom, above all the wisdom of the ancients, and more than all the wise men of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.  To be wise as men are in general is quite a different thing to being really wise. He who is ordinarily wise is wise for temporal matters, is wise for himself, so as to deprive another of something and get it for himself. He who is really wise does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to regard his own advantage, but looks with all his desire to that which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and to that which is seemly and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, seeking not what is useful for himself, but for all.</p>

<p>13. Let this, then, be our rule,  so that we may never go wrong between two things, one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, the other useful. The upright man must never think of depriving another of anything, nor must he ever wish to increase his own advantage to the disadvantage of another. This rule the Apostle gives you, saying: <q>All things are lawful, but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful, but all things edify not. Let no man seek his own, but each one another's.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340611"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:23-24</a></span> That is: Let no man seek his own advantage, but another's; let no man seek his own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, but another's. Wherefore he says in another place: <q>Let each esteem other better than themselves, looking not each one to his own things, but to the things of others.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340612"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse3">Philippians&nbsp;2:3-4</a></span> </p>

<p>14. And let no one seek his own favour or his own praise, but another's. This we can plainly see declared in the book of Proverbs, where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> says through Solomon: <q>My son, if you be wise, be wise for yourself and your neighbours; but if you turn out <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, thou alone shall bear it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340613"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse12">Proverbs&nbsp;9:12</a></span> The wise man gives counsel to others, as the upright man does, and shares with him in wearing the form of either <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p><strong>The rule given about not seeking one's own gain is established, first by the examples of Christ, next by the meaning of the word, and lastly by the very form and uses of our limbs. Wherefore the writer shows what a crime it is to deprive another of what is useful, since the law of nature as well as the divine law is broken by such wickedness. Further, by its means we also lose that gift which makes us superior to other living creatures; and lastly, through it civil laws are abused and treated with the greatest contempt.</strong></p>

<p>15. If, then, any one wishes to please all, he must strive in everything to do, not what is useful for himself, but what is useful for many, as also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> strove to do. For this is <q>to be conformed to the image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340614"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;8:29</a></span> namely, when one does not strive for what is another's, and does not deprive another of something so as to gain it for oneself. For Christ our Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note340615"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;2:6-7</a></span> though He was in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, emptied Himself so as to take on Himself the form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which He wished to enrich with the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of His works. Will you, then, spoil him whom Christ has put on? Will you strip him whom Christ has clothed? For this is what you are doing when thou dost attempt to increase your own advantage at another's loss.</p>

<p>16. Think, O man, from whence you have received your name&mdash; even from the earth,  which takes nothing from any one, but gives freely to all, and supplies varied produce for the use of all living things. Hence humanity is called a particular and innate <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in man, for it assists its partner.</p>

<p>17. The very form of your body and the uses of your limbs teach you this. Can one limb claim the duties of another? Can the eye claim for itself the duties of the ear; or the mouth the duties of the eye; or the hand the service of the feet; or the feet that of the hands? Nay, the hands themselves, both left and right, have different duties to do, so that if one were to change the use of either, one would act contrary to nature. We should have to lay aside the whole man before we could change the service of the various members: as if, for instance, we were to try to take food with the left hand, or to perform the duties of the left hand with the right, so as to remove the remains of food&mdash; unless, of course, need demanded it.</p>

<p>18. Imagine for a moment, and give to the eye the power to withdraw the understanding from the head, the sense of hearing from the ears, the power of thought from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the sense of smell from the nose, the sense of taste from the mouth, and then to assume them itself, would it not at once destroy the whole order of nature? Wherefore the Apostle says well: <q>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340617"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:17</a></span> So, then, we are all one body, though with many members, all necessary to the body. For no one member can say of another: <q>I have no need of you.</q> For those members which seem to be more feeble are much more necessary and require greater care and attention. And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. <span class="stiki" id="note340618"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:26</a></span> </p>

<p>19. So we see how grave a matter it is to deprive another, with whom we ought rather to suffer, of anything, or to act unfairly or injuriously towards one to whom we ought to give a share in our services. This is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> law of nature, which binds us to show all kindly feeling, so that we should all of us in turn help one another, as parts of one body, and should never think of depriving another of anything, seeing it is against the law of nature even to abstain from giving help. We are born in such a way that limb combines with limb, and one works with another, and all assist each other in mutual service. But if one fails in its duty, the rest are hindered. If, for instance, the hand tears out the eye, has it not hindered the use of its work? If it were to wound the foot, how many actions would it not prevent? But how much worse is it for the whole man to be drawn aside from his duty than for one of the members only! If the whole body is injured in one member, so also is the whole community of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> disturbed in one man. The nature of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> is injured, as also is the society of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, which rises into one united body, bound together in oneness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Christ the Lord, also, Who died for all, will grieve that the price of His blood was paid in vain.</p>

<p>20. Why, the very law of the Lord teaches us that this rule must be observed, so that we may never deprive another of anything for the sake of our own advantage. For it says: <q>Remove not the bounds which your fathers have set.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340619"><a href="../bible/pro022.htm#verse28">Proverbs&nbsp;22:28</a></span> It bids a neighbour's ox to be brought back if found wandering. <span class="stiki" id="note340620"><a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse4">Exodus&nbsp;23:4</a></span> It orders a thief to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note340621"><a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse2">Exodus&nbsp;22:2</a></span> It forbids the labourer to be deprived of his hire, <span class="stiki" id="note340622"><a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse13">Leviticus&nbsp;19:13</a></span> and orders money to be returned without <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note340623"><a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse19">Deuteronomy&nbsp;23:19</a></span> It is a mark of kindly feeling to help him who has nothing, but it is a sign of a hard nature to extort more than one has given. If a man has need of your assistance because he has not enough of his own wherewith to repay a debt, is it not a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thing to demand under the guise of kindly feeling a larger sum from him who has not the means to pay off a less amount? Thou dost but free him from debt to another, to bring him under your own hand; and you call that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> kindliness which is but a further <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</p>

<p>21. It is in this very matter that we stand before all other living creatures, for they do not understand how to do good. Wild beasts snatch away, men share with others. Wherefore the Psalmist says: <q>The righteous shows  mercy and gives.</q>  There are some, however, to whom the wild beasts do good. They feed their young with what they get, and the birds satisfy their brood with food; but to men alone has it been given to feed all as though they were their own. That is so in accordance with the claims of nature. And if it is not lawful to refuse to give, how is it lawful to deprive another? And do not our very <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> teach us the same? They order those things which have been taken from others with injury to their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or property to be restored with additional recompense; so as to check the thief from stealing by the penalty, and by the fine to recall him from his ways.</p>

<p>22. Suppose, however, that some one did not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the penalty, or laughed at the fine, would that make it a worthy thing to deprive another of his own? That would be a mean <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and suited only to the lowest of the low. So contrary to nature is it, that while want might seem to drive one to it, yet nature could never urge it. And yet we find secret theft among slaves, open <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> among the rich.</p>

<p>23. But what so contrary to nature as to injure another for our own benefit? The natural feelings of our own hearts urge us to keep on the watch for all, to undergo trouble, to do work for all. It is considered also a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> thing for each one at risk to himself to seek the quiet of all, and to think it far more thankworthy to have saved his country from destruction than to have kept danger from himself. We must think it a far more noble thing to labour for our country than to pass a quiet life at ease in the full enjoyment of leisure.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p><strong>As it has been shown that he who injures another for the sake of his own advantage will undergo terrible punishment at the hand of his own conscience, it is referred that nothing is useful to one which is not in the same way useful to all. Thus there is no place among Christians for the question propounded by the philosophers about two shipwrecked persons, for they must show love and humility to all.</strong></p>

<p>24. Hence we infer  that a man who guides himself according to the ruling of nature, so as to be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to her, can never injure another. If he injures another, he violates nature, nor will he think that what he has gained is so much an advantage as a disadvantage. And what punishment is worse than the wounds of the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> within? What judgment harder than that of our hearts, whereby each one stands convicted and accuses himself of the injury that he has wrongfully done against his brother? This the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> speak of very plainly, saying: <q>Out of the mouth of fools there is a rod for wrong-doing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340626"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse3">Proverbs&nbsp;14:3</a></span> Folly, then, is condemned because it causes wrong-doing. Ought we not rather to avoid this, than death, or loss, or want, or exile, or sickness? Who would not think some blemish of body or loss of inheritance far less than some blemish of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or loss of <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>?</p>

<p>25. It is clear, then,  that all must consider and hold that the advantage of the individual is the same as that of all, and that nothing must be considered advantageous except what is for the general good. For how can one be benefited alone? That which is useless to all is harmful. I certainly cannot think that he who is useless to all can be of use to himself. For if there is one law of nature for all, there is also one state of usefulness for all. And we are bound by the law of nature to act for the good of all. It is not, therefore, right for him who wishes the interests of another to be considered according to nature, to injure him against the law of nature.</p>

<p>26. For if those who run in a race  are, as one hears, instructed and warned each one to win the race by swiftness of foot and not by any foul play, and to hasten on to victory by running as hard as they can, but not to dare to trip up another or push him aside with their hand, how much more in the course of this life ought the victory to be won by us, without falseness to another and cheating?</p>

<p>27. Some ask  whether a wise man ought in case of a shipwreck to take away a plank from an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> sailor? Although it seems better for the common good that a wise man rather than a fool should escape from shipwreck, yet I do not think that a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and a wise man, ought to save his own life by the death of another; just as when he meets with an armed robber he cannot return his blows, lest in defending his life he should stain his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> toward his neighbour. The verdict on this is plain and clear in the books of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. <q>Put up your sword, for every one that takes the sword shall perish with the sword.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340630"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse52">Matthew&nbsp;26:52</a></span> What robber is more hateful than the persecutor who came to kill Christ? But Christ would not be defended from the wounds of the persecutor, for He willed to heal all by His wounds.</p>

<p>28. Why do you consider yourself greater than another, when a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man ought to put others before himself, to claim nothing for himself, usurp no honours, claim no reward for his merits? Why, next, are you not wont to bear your own troubles rather than to destroy another's advantage? For what is so contrary to nature as not to be content with what one has or to seek what is another's, and to try to get it in shameful ways. For if a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life is in accordance with nature&mdash; for God made all things very good&mdash; then shameful living must be opposed to it. A <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and a shameful life cannot go together, since they are absolutely severed by the law of nature.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p><strong>The upright does nothing that is contrary to duty, even though there is a hope of keeping it secret. To point this out the tale about the ring of Gyges was invented by the philosophers. Exposing this, he brings forward known and true examples from the life of David and John the Baptist.</strong></p>

<p>29. To lay down here already the result of our discussion, as though we had already ended it, we declare it a fixed rule, that we must never aim at anything but what is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>.  The wise man does nothing but what can be done openly and without falseness,  nor does he do anything whereby he may involve himself in any wrong-doing, even where he may escape notice. For he is guilty in his own eyes, before being so in the eyes of others; and the publicity of his crime does not bring him more shame than his own consciousness of it. This we can show, not by the made-up stories which <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> use, but from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> examples of good men.</p>

<p>30. I need not, therefore, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> a great chasm in the earth, which had been loosened by heavy rains, and had afterwards burst asunder, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> does.  For he makes Gyges descend into that chasm, and to meet there that iron horse of the fable that had doors in its sides. When these doors were opened, he found a gold ring on the finger of a dead man, whose corpse lay there lifeless. He desiring the gold took away the ring. But when he returned to the king's shepherds, to whose number he belonged, by chance having turned the stone inwards towards the palms of his hands, he saw all, yet was seen by none. Then when he turned the ring to its proper position, he was again seen by all. On becoming conscious of this strange power, by the use of the ring he committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with the queen, killed the king, and took possession of the kingdom after slaying all the rest, who he thought should be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, so that they might be no hindrance to him.</p>

<p>31. Give, says <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, this ring to a wise man, that when he commits a fault he may by its help remain unnoticed; yet he will be none the more free from the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than if he could not be hid. The hiding-place of the wise lies not in the hope of impunity but in his own innocency. Lastly, the law is not laid down for the just but for the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note340634"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:9</a></span> For the just has within himself the law of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and a rule of equity and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Thus he is not recalled from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment, but by the rule of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life.</p>

<p>32. Therefore, to return to our subject, I will now bring forward, not false examples for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> examples in place of false. For why need I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> a chasm in the earth, and an iron horse and a gold ring found on the fingers of a dead man; and say that such was the power of this ring, that he who wore it could appear at his own will, but if he did not wish to be seen, he could remove himself out of the sight of those who stood by, so as to seem to be away. This story, of course, is meant to answer the question whether a wise man, on getting the opportunity of using that ring so as to be able to hide his crimes, and to obtain a kingdom,&mdash; whether, I say, a wise man would be unwilling to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and would consider the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> far worse than the pains of punishment, or whether he would use it for doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in the hope of not being found out? Why, I say, should I need the pretence of a ring, when I can show from what has been done that a wise man, on seeing he would not only be undetected in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but would also gain a kingdom if he gave way to it, and who, on the other hand, noted danger to his own safety if he did not commit the crime, yet chose to risk his own safety so as to be free from crime, rather than to commit the crime and so gain the kingdom.</p>

<p>33. When David fled from the face of King Saul,  because the king was seeking him in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> with three thousand chosen men to put him to death, he entered the king's camp and found him sleeping. There he not only did him no injury, but actually guarded him from being slain by any who had entered with him. For when Abishai said to him: <q>The Lord has delivered your enemy into your hand this day, now therefore I will slay him,</q> he answered: <q>Destroy him not, for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord's anointed, and be guiltless?</q> And he added: <q>As the Lord lives, unless the Lord shall smite him, or his day shall come to die, or he shall die in battle, and it be laid to me, the Lord forbid that I should stretch out my hand against the Lord's anointed.</q> </p>

<p>34. Therefore he did not suffer him to be slain, but removed only his spear, which stood by his head, and his cruse of water. Then, while all were sleeping, he left the camp and went across to the top of the hill, and began to reproach the royal attendants, and especially their general Abner, for not keeping faithful watch over their lord and king. Next, he showed them where the king's spear and cruse were which had stood at his head. And when the king called to him, he restored the spear, and said: <q>The Lord render to every man his righteousness and faithfulness, for the Lord delivered you into my hand, but I would not avenge myself on the Lord's anointed.</q>  Even while he said this, he feared his plots and fled, changing his place in exile. However, he never put safety before innocency, seeing that when a second opportunity was given him of killing the king, he would not use the chance that came to him, and which put in his reach certain safety instead of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and a kingdom instead of exile.</p>

<p>35. Where was the use of the ring in John's case, <span class="stiki" id="note340638"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;14:3</a></span> who would not have been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> if he had kept silence? He could have kept silence before him so as to be both seen and yet not killed. But because he not only could not endure to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> himself to protect his own safety, but could not bear and endure even another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he brought about the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his own death. Certainly none can deny that he might have kept silence, who in the case of Gyges deny that he could have remained invisible by the help of the ring.</p>

<p>36. But although that fable has not the force of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, yet it has this much to go upon, that if an upright man could hide himself, yet he would avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> just as though he could not conceal himself; and that he would not hide his person by putting on a ring, but his life by putting on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. As the Apostle says: <q>Our life is hid with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340639"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse3">Colossians&nbsp;3:3</a></span> Let, then, no one here strive to shine, let none show <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, let none boast. Christ willed not to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> here, He would not that His Name should be preached in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> while He lived on earth. He came to lie hidden from this world. Let us therefore likewise hide our life after the example of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let us shun boastfulness, let us not desire to be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. It is better to live here in humility, and there in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. <q>When Christ,</q> it says, <q>shall appear, then shall we also appear with Him in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340640"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse4">Colossians&nbsp;3:4</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 6.</h2>

<p><strong>We ought not to allow the idea of profit to get hold of us. What excuses they make who get their gains by selling grain, and what answer ought to be made to them. In connection with this certain parables from the Gospels and some of the sayings of Solomon are set before our eyes.</strong></p>

<p>37. Let not, therefore, expediency get the better of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of expediency. By expediency here I mean what is accounted so by people generally. Let <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a> be destroyed, let <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> die. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man says that he has never been engaged in business.  For to get an increase in price is a sign not of simplicity but of cunning. Elsewhere it says: <q>He that seeks a high price for his grain is cursed among the people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340642"><a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse26">Proverbs&nbsp;11:26</a></span> </p>

<p>38. Plain and definite is the statement, leaving no room for debate, such as a disputatious kind of speaking is wont to give, when one maintains that agriculture is considered praiseworthy by all; that the fruits of the earth are easily grown; that the more a man has sown, the greater will be his meed of praise; further, that the richer returns of his active labours are not gained by fraud, and that carelessness and disregard for an uncultivated soil are wont to be blamed.</p>

<p>39. I have ploughed, he says, carefully. I have sown freely. I have tilled actively. I have gathered good increase. I have stored it anxiously, saved it faithfully, and guarded it with care. Now in a time of famine I sell it, and come to the help of the hungry. I sell my own grain, not another's. And for no more than others, nay, even at a less price. What fraud is there here, when many would come to great danger if they had nothing to buy? Is industry to be made a crime? Or diligence to be blamed? Or foresight to be abused? Perhaps he may even say: Joseph collected grain in a time of abundance, and sold it when it was dear. Is any one forced to buy it at too dear a price? Is force employed against the buyer? The opportunity to buy is afforded to all, injury is inflicted on none.</p>

<p>40. When this has been said, and one man's ideas have carried him so far, another rises and says: Agriculture is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> indeed, for it supplies fruits for all, and by simple industry adds to the richness of the earth without any cheating or fraud. If there is any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, the loss is the greater, for the better a man sows, the better he will reap. If he has sown the pure grain of wheat, he gathers a purer and cleaner harvest. The fruitful earth returns what she has received in manifold measure. A good field returns its produce with interest.</p>

<p>41. You must expect payment for your labour from the crops of the fruitful land, and must hope for a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> return from the fruitfulness of the rich earth. Why do you use the industry of nature and make a cheat of it? Why do you grudge for the use of men what is grown for all? Why lessen the abundance for the people? Why make want your aim? Why make the poor long for a barren season? For when they do not feel the benefits of a fruitful season, because you are putting up the price, and art storing up the grain, they would far rather that nothing should be produced, than that you should do business at the expense of other people's hunger. You make much of the lack of grain, the small supply of food. You groan over the rich crops of the soil; you mourn the general plenty, and bewailest the garners full of grain; you are on the lookout to see when the crop is poor and the harvest fails. You rejoice that a curse has smiled upon your wishes, so that none should have their produce. Then you rejoice that your harvest has come. Then you collect <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> from the misery of all, and callest this industry and diligence, when it is but cunning shrewdness and an adroit trick of the trade. You call it a remedy, when it is but a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> contrivance. Shall I call this <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> or only gain? These opportunities are seized as though seasons for plunder, wherein, like some cruel waylayer, you may fall upon the stomachs of men. The price rises higher as though by the mere addition of interest, but the danger to life is increased too. For then the interest of the stored-up crops grows higher. As a usurer you hide up your grain, as a seller you put it up for auction. Why do you wish <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to all, because the famine will grow worse, as though no grain should be left, as though a more unfruitful year should follow? Your gain is the public loss.</p>

<p>42. Holy Joseph opened the garners to all; he did not shut them up. He did not try to get the full price of the year's produce, but assigned it for a yearly payment. He took nothing for himself, but, so far as famine could be checked for the future, he made his arrangements with careful foresight.</p>

<p>43. You have read how the Lord Jesus in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> speaks of that grain-dealer who was looking out for a high price, whose possessions brought him in rich fruits, but who, as though still in need, said: <q>What shall I do? I have no room where to bestow my goods. I will pull down my barns and build greater,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340643"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse17">Luke&nbsp;12:17</a></span> though he could not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether in the following night his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would not be demanded of him. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what to do, he seemed to be in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, just as though he were in want of food. His barns could not take in the year's supply, and yet he thought he was in need.</p>

<p>44. Rightly, therefore, Solomon says: <q>He that withholds grain shall leave it for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>,</q>  not for his heirs, for the gains of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> have nothing to do with the rights of succession. That which is not rightfully got together is scattered as though by a wind by outsiders that seize it. And he added: <q>He who grasps at the year's produce is cursed among the people, but blessing shall be his that imparts it.</q> You see, then, what is said of him who distributes the grain, but not of him that seeks for a high price. True expediency does not therefore exist where <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> loses more than expediency gains.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.</h2>

<p><strong>Strangers must never be expelled the city in a time of famine. In this matter the noble advice of a Christian sage is adduced, in contrast to which the shameful deed committed at Rome is given. By comparing the two it is shown that the former is combined with what is virtuous and useful, but the latter with neither.</strong></p>

<p>45. But they, too, who would forbid the city to strangers  cannot have our approval. They would expel them at the very time when they ought to help, and separate them from the trade of their common parent. They would refuse them a share in the produce meant for all, and avert the intercourse that has already begun; and they are unwilling, in a time of necessity, to give those with whom they have enjoyed their rights in common, a share in what they themselves have. Beasts do not drive out beasts, yet man shuts out man. Wild beasts and animals consider food which the earth supplies to be common to all. They all give assistance to those like themselves; and man, who ought to think nothing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> foreign to himself, fights against his own.</p>

<p>46. How much better did he act who, having already reached an advanced age, when the city was suffering from famine, and, as is common in such cases, the people demanded that strangers should be forbidden the city, having the office of the prefectship  of the city, which is higher than the rest, called together the officials and richer men, and demanded that they should take counsel for the public welfare. He said that it was as cruel a thing for the strangers to be expelled as for one man to be cast off by another, and to be refused food when dying. We do not allow our dogs to come to our table and leave them unfed, yet we shut out a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. How unprofitable, again, it is for the world that so many people perish, whom some deadly plague carries off. How unprofitable for their city that so large a number should perish, who were wont to be helpful either in paying contributions or in carrying on business. Another's hunger is profitable to no man, nor to put off the day of help as long as possible and to do nothing to check the want. Nay more, when so many of the cultivators of the soil are gone, when so many labourers are dying, the grain supplies will fail for the future. Shall we then expel those who are wont to supply us with food, are we unwilling to feed in a time of need those who have fed us all along? How great is the assistance which they supply even at this time. <q>Not by bread alone does man live.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340647"><a href="../bible/deu008.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy&nbsp;8:3</a></span> They are even our own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; many of them even are our own kindred. Let us make some return for what we have received.</p>

<p>47. But perhaps we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that want may increase. First of all, I answer, mercy never fails, but always finds means of help. Next, let us make up for the grain supplies which are to be granted to them, by a subscription. Let us put that right with our gold. And, again, must we not buy other cultivators of the soil if we lose these? How much cheaper is it to feed than to buy a working-man. Where, too, can one obtain, where find a man to take the place of the former? And suppose one finds him, do not forget that, with an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> man used to different ways, one may fill up the place in point of numbers, but not as regards the work to be done.</p>

<p>48. Why need I say more? When the money was supplied grain was brought in. So the city's abundance was not diminished, and yet assistance was given to the strangers. What praise this act won that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man from God! What <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>! He, indeed, had won an honoured name, who, pointing to the people of a whole province, could <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> say to the emperor: All these I have preserved for you; these live owing to the kindness of the senate; these your council  has snatched from death!</p>

<p>49. How much more expedient was this than that which was done lately at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There from that widely extended city were those expelled who had already passed most of their life in it. In tears they went forth with their children, for whom as being citizens they bewailed the exile, which, as they said, ought to be averted; no less did they grieve over the broken bonds of union, the severed ties of relationship. And yet a fruitful year had smiled upon us. The city alone needed grain to be brought into it. It could have got help, if it had sought grain from the Italians whose children they were driving out. Nothing is more shameful than to expel a man as a foreigner, and yet to claim his services as though he belonged to us. How can you expel a man who lives on his own produce? How can you expel him who supplies you with food? You retain your servant, and thrust out your kindred! You take the grain, but show no good feeling! You take food by force, but do not show gratitude!</p>

<p>50. How wretched this is, how useless! For how can that be expedient which is not seemly. Of what great supplies from her corporations has Rome at times been deprived, yet she could not dismiss them and yet escape a famine, while waiting for a favourable breeze, and the provisions in the hoped-for ships.</p>

<p>51. How far more <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and expedient was that first-mentioned management! For what is so seemly or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> as when the needy are assisted by the gifts of the rich, when food is supplied to the hungry, when daily bread fails none? What so advantageous as when the cultivators are kept for the land, and the country people do not perish?</p>

<p>52. What is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, then, is also expedient, and what is expedient is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. On the other hand, what is not expedient is unseemly, and what is unseemly is also not expedient.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.</h2>

<p><strong>That those who put what is virtuous before what is useful are acceptable to God is shown by the example of Joshua, Caleb, and the other spies.</strong></p>

<p>53. When could our fathers ever have thrown off their servitude, unless they had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that it was not only shameful but even useless to serve the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>?</p>

<p>54. Joshua, also, and Caleb, when sent to spy out the land, brought back the news that the land was indeed rich, but that it was inhabited by very fierce nations. <span class="stiki" id="note340649"><a href="../bible/num013.htm#verse27">Numbers&nbsp;13:27-28</a></span> The people, terrified at the thought of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, refused to take possession of their land. Joshua and Caleb, who had been sent as spies, tried to persuade them that the land was fruitful. They thought it unseemly to give way before the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>; they chose rather to be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, which is what the people threatened, than to recede from their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> standpoint. The others kept dissuading, the people exclaimed against it, saying they would have to fight against cruel and terrible nations; that they would fall in battle, and their wives and children would be left for a prey. <span class="stiki" id="note340650"><a href="../bible/num014.htm#verse3">Numbers&nbsp;14:3</a></span> </p>

<p>55. The <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of the Lord burst forth,  so that He would kill all, but at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> He softened His judgment and put off His vengeance, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that He had already sufficiently punished those who were faithless, even if He spared them meanwhile and did not slay the unbelievers. However, He said <span class="stiki" id="note340652"><a href="../bible/num014.htm#verse29">Numbers&nbsp;14:29</a></span> they should not come to that land which they had refused, as a penalty for their unbelief; but their children and wives, who had not murmured, and who, owing to their sex and age, were guiltless, should receive the promised inheritance of that land. So the bodies of those of twenty years old and upwards fell in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. The punishment of the rest was put aside. But they who had gone up with Joshua, and had thought fit to dissuade the people, died immediately of a great plague. <span class="stiki" id="note340653"><a href="../bible/num014.htm#verse37">Numbers&nbsp;14:37</a></span> Joshua and Caleb <span class="stiki" id="note340654"><a href="../bible/jos014.htm#verse6">Joshua&nbsp;14:6</a></span> entered the land of promise together with those who were innocent by reason of age or sex.</p>

<p>56. The better part, therefore, preferred <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to safety; the worse part safety to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But the divine judgment approved those who thought <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was above what is useful, while it condemned those who preferred what seemed more in accordance with safety than with what is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.</h2>

<p><strong>Cheating and dishonest ways of making money are utterly unfit for clerics whose duty is to serve all. They ought never to be involved in a money affair, unless it is one affecting a man's life. For them the example of David is given, that they should injure none, even when provoked; also the death of Naboth, to keep them from preferring life to virtue.</strong></p>

<p>57. Nothing is more odious than for a man to have no <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life, but instead to be kept excited by an unworthy business in following out a low line of trade, or to be inflamed by an avaricious heart, and by day and by night to be eager to damage another's property, not to raise the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the splendour of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life, and not to regard the beauty of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> praise.</p>

<p>58. Hence rise inheritances sought by cunning words and gained under pretence of being self-restrained and serious. But this is absolutely abhorrent to the idea of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man. For everything gained by craft and got together by cheating loses the merit of openness. Even among those who have undertaken no duty in the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> it is considered unfitting to seek for the inheritance of another. Let those who are reaching the end of their life use their own judgment, so that they may freely make their wills as they think best, since they will not be able to amend them later. For it is not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> to divert the savings that belong to others or have been got together for them. It is further the duty of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> to be of use if possible to all and to be harmful to none. </p>

<p>59. If it is not possible to help one without injuring another, it is better to help neither than to press hard upon one. Therefore it is not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> duty to interfere in money affairs. For here it must often happen that he who loses his case receives harm; and then he considers that he has been worsted through the action of the intervener. It is a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> duty to hurt no one, to be ready to help all. To be able to do this is in God's power alone. In a case of life and death, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it is a grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to injure him whom one ought to help when in danger. But it is foolish to gain others' <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> in taking up money matters, though for the sake of a man's safety great trouble and toil may often be undertaken. It is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> in such a case to run risks. Let, then, this be firmly held to in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> duties, namely, to injure none, not even when provoked and embittered by some injury.  Good was the man who said: <q>If I have rewarded <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to those who did me good.</q>  For what <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is it if we do not injure him who has not injured us? But it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to forgive when injured.</p>

<p>60. What a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> action was that, when David wished rather to spare the king his enemy, though he could have injured him!  How useful, too, it was, for it helped him when he succeeded to the throne. For all learned to observe <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to their king and not to seize the kingdom, but to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and reverence him. Thus what is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> was preferred to what was useful, and then usefulness followed on what was <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>.</p>

<p>61. But that he spared him was a small matter; he also grieved for him when slain in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and mourned for him with tears, saying: You mountains of Gilboa, let neither dew nor rain fall upon you; ye mountains of death, for there the shield of the mighty is cast away, the shield of Saul. It is not anointed with oil, but with the blood of the wounded and the fat of the warriors. The bow of Jonathan turned not back and the sword of Saul returned not empty. Saul and Jonathan were lovely and very dear, inseparable in life, and in death they were not divided. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. You daughters of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet with your ornaments, who put on gold upon your apparel. How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan was wounded even to death. I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant have you been unto me. Your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> came to me like the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. How have the mighty fallen and the longed-for weapons perished! </p>

<p>62. What mother could weep thus for her only son as he wept here for his enemy? Who could follow his benefactor with such praise as that with which he followed the man who plotted against his life? How affectionately he grieved, with what deep feeling he bewailed him! The mountains dried up at the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> curse, and a divine power filled the judgment of him who spoke it. Therefore the elements themselves paid the penalty for witnessing the king's death.</p>

<p>63. And what, in the case of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Naboth, was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his death, except his regard for a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life? For when the king demanded the vineyard from him, promising to give him money, he refused the price for his father's heritage as unseemly, and preferred to shun such shame by dying. <q>The Lord forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto you;</q>  that is, that such reproach may not fall on me, that God may not allow such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> to be attained by force. He is not speaking about the vines&mdash; nor has God care for vines or plots of ground&mdash; but he says it of his fathers' rights. He could have received another or the king's vineyards and been his friend, wherein men think there is no small usefulness so far as this world is concerned. But because it was base he thought it could not be useful, and so he preferred to endure danger with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> intact, rather than gain what was useful to his own disgrace. I am here again speaking of what is commonly understood as useful, not that in which there is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life.</p>

<p>64. The king could himself have taken it by force, but that he thought too shameless; then when Naboth was dead he grieved.  The Lord also declared that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> cruelty should be punished by a fitting penalty, because she was unmindful of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and preferred a shameful gain. </p>

<p>65. Every kind of unfair action is shameful. Even in common things, false weights and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> measures are accursed. And if fraud in the market or in business is punished, can it seem free from reproach if found in the midst of the performance of the duties of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>? Solomon says: <q>A great and a little weight and various measures are an abomination before the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340663"><a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse10">Proverbs&nbsp;20:10</a></span> Before that it also says: <q>A false balance is abomination to the Lord, but a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> weight is acceptable to Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340664"><a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;11:1</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p><strong>We are warned not only in civil law, but also in the holy Scriptures, to avoid fraud in every agreement, as is clear from the example of Joshua and the Gibeonites.</strong></p>

<p>66. In everything, therefore, good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is seemly, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is pleasing, due measure in equity is delightful. But what shall I say about contracts, and especially about the sale of land, or agreements, or covenants? Are there not rules just for the purpose of shutting out all false deceit,  and to make him whose deceit is found out liable to double punishment? Everywhere, then, does regard for what is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> take the lead; it shuts out deceit, it expels fraud. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> David has rightly stated his judgment in general, saying: <q>He has done no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to his neighbour.</q>  Fraud, then, ought to be wanting not only in contracts, in which the defects of those things which are for sale are ordered to be recorded (which contracts, unless the vendor has mentioned the defects, are rendered void by an action for fraud, although he has conveyed them fully to the purchaser), but it ought also to be absent in all else. Candour must be shown, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</p>

<p>67. The <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> have plainly stated (not indeed a legal rule of the lawyers but) the ancient judgment of the patriarchs on deceit, in that book of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> which is ascribed to Joshua the son of Nun. When the report had gone forth among the various peoples that the sea was dried up at the crossing of the Hebrews; that water had flowed from the rock; that food was supplied daily from heaven in quantities large enough for so many thousands of the people; that the walls of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> had fallen at the sound of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> trumpets, being overthrown by the noise of the shouts of the people; also, that the king of Ai was conquered and had been hung on a tree until the evening; then the Gibeonites, fearing his strong hand, came with guile, pretending that they were from a land very far away, and by travelling so long had rent their shoes and worn out their clothing, of which they showed <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> that it was growing old. They said, too, that their reason for undergoing so much labour was their desire to obtain peace and to form friendship with the Hebrews, and began to ask Joshua to form an alliance with them. And he, being as yet <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of localities, and not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> anything of the inhabitants, did not see through their deceit, nor did he enquire of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but readily <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> them. </p>

<p>68. So sacred was one's plighted word held in those days that no one would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that others could try to deceive. Who could find fault with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in this, namely, that they should consider others to have the same feelings as themselves, and suppose no one would lie because <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was their own companion? They <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what deceit is, they gladly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> of others what they themselves are, while they cannot suspect others to be what they themselves are not. Hence Solomon says: <q>An innocent man <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> every word.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340668"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse15">Proverbs&nbsp;14:15</a></span> We must not blame his readiness to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but should rather praise his goodness. To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of anything that may injure another, this is to be innocent. And although he is cheated by another, still he thinks well of all, for he thinks there is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in all.</p>

<p>69. Induced, therefore, by such considerations to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, he made an agreement, he gave them peace, and formed a union with them. But when he came to their country and the deceit was found out&mdash;for though they lived quite close they pretended to be strangers&mdash;the people of our fathers began to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> at having been deceived. Joshua, however, thought the peace they had made could not be broken (for it had been confirmed by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>), for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that, in punishing the treachery of others, he should be breaking his own pledge. He made them pay the penalty, however, by forcing them to undertake the lowest kind of work. The judgment was mild indeed, but it was a lasting one, for in their duties there abides the punishment of their ancient cunning, handed down to this day <span class="stiki" id="note340669"><a href="../bible/jos009.htm#verse27">Joshua&nbsp;9:27</a></span> in their hereditary service.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p><strong>Having adduced examples of certain frauds found in a few passages of the rhetoricians, he shows that these and all others are more fully and plainly condemned in Scripture.</strong></p>

<p>70. I shall say nothing of the snapping of fingers, or the naked dancing of the heir, at entering on an inheritance.  These are well-known things. Nor will I speak of the mass of fishes gathered up at a pretended fishing expedition to excite the buyer's desires. For why did he show himself so eager for luxuries and delicacies as to allow a fraud of this character?</p>

<p>71. What need is there for me to speak of that well-known story of the pleasant and quiet retreat at Syracuse and of the cunning of a Sicilian?  For he having found a stranger, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he was anxious to buy an estate, asked him to his grounds for a meal. He accepted, and on the following day he came. There the sight of a great number of fishermen met his eyes, and a banquet laid out in the most splendid profusion. In the sight of the guests, fishers were placed in the garden-grounds, where no net had ever been laid before. Each one in turn presented to the guests what he had taken, the fish were placed upon the table, and caught the glance of those who sat there. The stranger wondered at the large quantity of fish and the number of boats there were. The answer given was, that this was the great water supply, and that great numbers of fish came there because of the sweetness of the water. To be brief, he drew on the stranger to be urgent in getting the grounds, he willingly allows himself to be induced to sell them, and seemingly with a heavy heart he receives the money.</p>

<p>72. On the next day the purchaser comes to the grounds with his friends, but finds no boat there. On asking whether perhaps the fishermen were observing a festival on that day, he is told that, with the exception of yesterday, they were never wont to fish there; but what power had he to proceed against such a fraud, who had so shamefully grasped at such luxuries? For he who convicts another of a fault ought himself to be free from it. I will not therefore include such trifles as these under the power of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> censure, for that altogether condemns every desire for dishonourable gain, and briefly, with few words, forbids every sharp and cunning action.</p>

<p>73. And what shall I say of him who claims to be the heir or legatee, on the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of a will  which, though falsified by others, yet was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be so by him, and who tries to make a gain through another's crime, though even the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the state convict him who knowingly makes use of a false will, as guilty of a wrong action. But the law of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is plain, namely, that a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man ought not to go aside from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, nor to inflict an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> loss on any one, nor to act at all deceitfully or to take part in any fraud.</p>

<p>74. What is clearer, however, on this point than the case of Ananias? He acted <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> as regards the price he got for his land, for he sold it and laid at the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> feet part of the price, pretending it was the whole amount. <span class="stiki" id="note340673"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;5:2</a></span> For this he perished as guilty of fraud. He might have offered nothing and have acted so without committing a fraud. But as deceit entered into his action, he gained no favour for his liberality, but paid the penalty for his artifice.</p>

<p>75. The Lord also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> rejected those coming to Him with guile, saying: <q>The foxes have holes,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340674"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;8:20</a></span> for He bids us live in simplicity and innocency of heart. David also says: <q>You have used deceit as a sharp razor,</q>  pointing out by this the treacherous man, just as an implement of this kind is used to help adorn a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, yet often wounds him. If any one makes a show of favour and yet plans deceit after the example of the traitor, so as to give up to death him whom he ought to guard, let him be looked on in the light of that instrument which is wont to wound owing to the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of a drunken mind and a trembling hand. Thus that man drunk with the wine of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> brought death on the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> Ahimelech,  through a terrible act of treachery, because he had received the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> with hospitality when the king, roused by the stings of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, was following him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p><strong>We may make no promise that is wrong, and if we have made an unjust oath, we may not keep it. It is shown that Herod sinned in this respect. The vow taken by Jephtha is condemned, and so are all others which God does not desire to have paid to Him. Lastly, the daughter of Jephtha is compared with the two Pythagoreans and is placed before them.</strong></p>

<p>76. A man's disposition ought to be undefiled and sound, so that he may utter words without dissimulation and possess his vessel in sanctification; <span class="stiki" id="note340677"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:6</a></span> that he may not delude his brother with false words nor promise anything dishonourable. If he has made such a promise it is far better for him not to fulfil it, rather than to fulfil what is shameful. </p>

<p>77. Often people bind themselves by a solemn <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and, though they come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they ought not to have made the promise, fulfil it in consideration of their <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. This is what <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> did, as we mentioned before.  For he made a shameful promise of reward to a dancer&mdash; and cruelly performed it. It was shameful, for a kingdom was promised for a dance; and it was cruel, for the death of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> for the sake of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. How much better <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> would have been than the keeping of such an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, if indeed that could be called <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> which a drunkard had <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> to in his wine-cups, or an effeminate profligate had promised while the dance was going on. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> head was brought in on a dish, <span class="stiki" id="note340680"><a href="../bible/mar006.htm#verse28">Mark&nbsp;6:28</a></span> and this was considered an act of good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> when it really was an act of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>!</p>

<p>78. Never shall I be led to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the leader Jephtha made his vow otherwise than without thought,  when he promised to offer to God whatever should meet him at the threshold of his house on his return. For he repented of his vow, as afterwards his daughter came to meet him. He rent his clothes and said: <q>Alas, my daughter, you have entangled me, you have become a source of trouble unto me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340682"><a href="../bible/jdg011.htm#verse35">Judges&nbsp;11:35</a></span> And though with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and reverence he took upon himself the bitter fulfilment of his cruel task, yet he ordered and left to be observed an annual period of grief and mourning for future times. It was a hard vow, but far more bitter was its fulfilment, while he who carried it out had the greatest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to mourn. Thus it became a rule and a law in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from year to year, as it says: <q>that the daughters of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> went to lament the daughter of Jephtha the Gileadite four days in a year.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340683"><a href="../bible/jdg011.htm#verse40">Judges&nbsp;11:40</a></span> I cannot blame the man for holding it necessary to fulfil his vow, but yet it was a wretched necessity which could only be solved by the death of his child.</p>

<p>79. It is better to make no vow than to vow what God does not wish to be paid to Him to Whom the promise was made. In the case of Isaac we have an example, for the Lord appointed a ram to be offered up instead of him. <span class="stiki" id="note340684"><a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse13">Genesis&nbsp;22:13</a></span> Therefore it is not always every promise that is to be fulfilled. Nay, the Lord Himself often alters His determination, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> point out. For in the book called Numbers He had declared that He would punish the people with death and destroy them, <span class="stiki" id="note340685"><a href="../bible/num014.htm#verse12">Numbers&nbsp;14:12</a></span> but afterwards, when besought by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, He was reconciled again to them. And again, He said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>: <q>Separate yourselves from among this congregation that I may consume them in a moment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340686"><a href="../bible/num016.htm#verse21">Numbers&nbsp;16:21</a></span> And when they separated from the assembly the earth suddenly clave asunder and opened her mouth and swallowed up Dathan and Abiram.</p>

<p>80. That example of Jephtha's daughter is far more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and ancient than that of the two Pythagoreans,  which is accounted so notable among the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. One of these, when condemned to death by the tyrant Dionysius, and when the day of his death was fixed, asked for leave to be granted him to go home, so as to provide for his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. But for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that he might break his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and not return, he offered a surety for his own death, on condition that if he himself were absent on the appointed day, his surety would be ready to die in his stead. The other did not refuse the conditions of suretyship which were proposed and awaited the day of death with a calm mind. So the one did not withdraw himself and the other returned on the day appointed. This all seemed so wonderful that the tyrant sought their friendship whose destruction he had been anxious for.</p>

<p>81. What, then, in the case of esteemed and learned men is full of marvel, that in the case of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> is found to be far more splendid, far more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, as she says to her sorrowing father: <q>Do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340688"><a href="../bible/jdg011.htm#verse36">Judges&nbsp;11:36</a></span> But she asked for a delay of two months in order that she might go about with her companions upon the mountains to bewail fitly and dutifully her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> now given up to death. The weeping of her companions did not move her, their grief prevailed not upon her, nor did their lamentations hold her back. She allowed not the day to pass, nor did the hour escape her notice. She returned to her father as though returning according to her own desire, and of her own will urged him on when he was hesitating, and acted thus of her own free choice, so that what was at first an awful chance became a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.</h2>

<p><strong>Judith, after enduring many dangers for virtue's sake, gained very many and great benefits.</strong></p>

<p>82. See! Judith presents herself to you as worthy of admiration. She approaches Holophernes, a man feared by the people, and surrounded by the victorious troops of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>. At first she makes an impression on him by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of her form and the beauty of her countenance. Then she entraps him by the refinement of her speech. Her first triumph was that she returned from the tent of the enemy with her purity unspotted. <span class="stiki" id="note340689"><a href="../bible/jth012.htm#verse20">Judith&nbsp;12:20</a></span> Her second, that she gained a victory over a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and put to flight the people by her counsel.</p>

<p>83. The Persians were terrified at her daring.  And so what is admired in the case of those two Pythagoreans deserves also in her case our admiration, for she trembled not at the danger of death, nor even at the danger her modesty was in, which is a matter of greater concern to good <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. She feared not the blow of one scoundrel, nor even the weapons of a whole army. She, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, stood between the lines of the combatants&mdash; right amidst victorious arms&mdash; heedless of death. As one looks at her overwhelming danger, one would say she went out to die; as one looks at her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one says she went but out to fight.</p>

<p>84. Judith then followed the call of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and as she follows that, she wins great benefits. It was <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> to prevent the people of the Lord from giving themselves up to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>; to prevent them from betraying their native <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, or from yielding up their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, their venerable <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and modest matrons to barbarian impurity, or from ending the siege by a surrender. It was <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> for her to be willing to encounter danger on behalf of all, so as to deliver all from danger.</p>

<p>85. How great must have been the power of her <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that she, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, should claim to give counsel on the chiefest matters and not leave it in the hands of the leaders of the people! How great, again, the power of her <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to reckon for certain upon God to help her! How great her <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to find His help!</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.</h2>

<p><strong>How virtuous and useful was that which Elisha did. This is compared with that oft-recounted act of the Greeks. John gave up his life for virtue's sake, and Susanna for the same reason exposed herself to the danger of death.</strong></p>

<p>86. What did Elisha follow but <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, when he brought the army of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> who had come to take him as captive into <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, after having covered their eyes with blindness? Then he said: <q>O Lord, open their eyes that they may see.</q>  And they saw. But when the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> wished to slay those that had entered and asked the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> to give him leave to do so, he answered that they whose captivity was not brought about by strength of hand or weapons of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> must not be slain, but that rather he should help them by supplying food. Then they were refreshed with plenty of food. And after that those Syrian <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> thought they must never again return to the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</p>

<p>87. How much nobler was this than that which the Greeks once did!  For when two nations strove one with the other to gain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and supreme power, and one of them had the opportunity to burn the ships of the other secretly, they thought it a shameful thing to do so, and preferred to gain a less advantage honourably than a greater one in shameful wise. They, indeed, could not act thus without disgrace to themselves, and entrap by this plot those who had banded together for the sake of ending the Persian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Though they could deny it in word, yet they could never but blush at the thought of it. Elisha, however, wished to save, not destroy, those who were deceived indeed, though not by some foul act, and had been struck blind by the power of the Lord. For it was seemly to spare an enemy, and to grant his life to an adversary when indeed he could have taken it, had he not spared it.</p>

<p>88. It is plain, then, that whatever is seemly is always useful. For <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Judith by seemly disregard for her own safety put an end to the dangers of the siege, and by her own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> won what was useful to all in common. And Elisha gained more renown by pardoning than he would have done by slaying, and preserved those enemies whom he had taken for greater usefulness.</p>

<p>89. And what else did John have in mind but what is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, so that he could not endure a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> union even in the king's case, saying: <q>It is not lawful for you to have her to wife.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340693"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;14:4</a></span> He could have been silent, had he not thought it unseemly for himself not to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death, or to make the prophetic office yield to the king, or to indulge in flattery. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> well that he would die as he was against the king, but he preferred <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to safety. Yet what is more expedient than the suffering which brought <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the saint.</p>

<p>90. Holy Susanna, too, when threatened with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, seeing herself hard pressed on one side by danger, on the other by disgrace, preferred to avoid disgrace by a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> death rather than to endure and live a shameful life in the desire to save herself.  So while she fixed her mind on <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, she also preserved her life. But if she had preferred what seemed to her to be useful to preserve life, she would never have gained such great renown, nay, perhaps&mdash; and that would have been not only useless but even dangerous&mdash; she might even not have escaped the penalty for her crime. We note, therefore, that whatsoever is shameful cannot be useful, nor, again, can that which is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> be useless. For usefulness is ever the double of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of usefulness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.</h2>

<p><strong>After mentioning a noble action of the Romans, the writer shows from the deeds of Moses that he had the greatest regard for what is virtuous.</strong></p>

<p>91. It is related as a memorable deed of a Roman general,  that when the physician of a hostile king came to him and promised to give him poison, he sent him back bound to the enemy. In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it is a noble thing for a man to refuse to gain the victory by foul acts, after he has entered on the struggle for power. He did not consider <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to lie in victory, but declared that to be a shameful victory unless it was gained with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. </p>

<p>92. Let us return to our hero <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and to loftier <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, to show they were both superior as well as earlier. The king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> would not let the people of our fathers go. Then <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> bade the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> to stretch his rod over all the waters of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> stretched it out, and the water of the river was turned into blood. <span class="stiki" id="note340697"><a href="../bible/exo007.htm#verse19">Exodus&nbsp;7:19</a></span> None could drink the water, and all the Egyptians were perishing with thirst; but there was pure water flowing in abundance for the fathers. They sprinkled ashes toward heaven, and sores and burning boils came upon man and beast. <span class="stiki" id="note340698"><a href="../bible/exo009.htm#verse10">Exodus&nbsp;9:10</a></span> They brought down hail mingled with flaming fire, and all things were destroyed upon the land. <span class="stiki" id="note340699"><a href="../bible/exo009.htm#verse23">Exodus&nbsp;9:23</a></span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and all things were restored to their former beauty. The hail ceased, the sores were healed, the rivers gave their wonted draught. <span class="stiki" id="note340700"><a href="../bible/exo009.htm#verse29">Exodus&nbsp;9:29</a></span> </p>

<p>93. Then, again, the land was covered with thick darkness for the space of three days, because <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had raised his hand and spread out the darkness. <span class="stiki" id="note340701"><a href="../bible/exo010.htm#verse22">Exodus&nbsp;10:22</a></span> All the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> died, while all the offspring of the Hebrews was left unharmed. <span class="stiki" id="note340702"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse29">Exodus&nbsp;12:29</a></span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was asked to put an end to these horrors, and he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> and obtained his request. In the one case it was a fact worthy of praise that he checked himself from joining in deceit; in the other it was noteworthy how, by his innate goodness, he turned aside from the foe those divinely ordered punishments. He was indeed, as it is written, gentle and meek. <span class="stiki" id="note340703"><a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse3">Numbers&nbsp;12:3</a></span> He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the king would not keep <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to his promises, yet he thought it right and good to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> when asked to do so, to bless when wronged, to forgive when besought.</p>

<p>94. He cast down his rod and it became a serpent which devoured the serpents of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note340704"><a href="../bible/exo007.htm#verse12">Exodus&nbsp;7:12</a></span> this signifying that the Word should become Flesh to destroy the poison of the dread serpent by the forgiveness and pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For the rod stands for the Word that is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>&mdash; royal&mdash; filled with power&mdash; and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> in ruling. The rod became a serpent; so He Who was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> begotten of the Father became the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and lifted, like the serpent, on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, poured His healing medicine on the wounds of man. Wherefore the Lord Himself says: <q>As <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> be lifted up.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340705"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;3:14</a></span> </p>

<p>95. Again, another sign which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> gave points to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. He put his hand into his bosom, and drew it out again, and his hand was become as snow. A second time he put it in and drew it out, and it was again like the appearance of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh. <span class="stiki" id="note340706"><a href="../bible/exo004.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;4:6-7</a></span> This signified first the original <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Godhead of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, and then the assumption of our flesh, in which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> all nations and peoples must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. So he put in his hand, for Christ is the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and whosoever does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His Godhead and Incarnation is punished as a sinner; like that king who, while not believing open and plain signs, yet afterwards, when punished, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that he might find mercy. How great, then, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> regard for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> must have been is shown by these <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, and especially by the fact that he offered himself on behalf of the people, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> that God would either forgive the people or blot him out of the book of the living. <span class="stiki" id="note340707"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse32">Exodus&nbsp;32:32</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 16.</h2>

<p><strong>After saying a few words about Tobit he demonstrates that Raguel surpassed the philosophers in virtue.</strong></p>

<p>96. Tobit also clearly portrayed in his life <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, when he left the feast and buried the dead, <span class="stiki" id="note340708"><a href="../bible/tob002.htm#verse4">Tobit&nbsp;2:4</a></span> and invited the needy to the meals at his own poor table. And Raguel is a still brighter example. For he, in his regard for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, when asked to give his daughter in marriage, was not silent regarding his daughter's faults, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of seeming to get the better of the suitor by silence. So when Tobit the son of Tobias asked that his daughter might be given him, he answered that, according to the law, she ought to be given him as near of kin, but that he had already given her to six men, and all of them were dead. <span class="stiki" id="note340709"><a href="../bible/tob007.htm#verse11">Tobit&nbsp;7:11</a></span> This just man, then, feared more for others than for himself, and wished rather that his daughter should remain unmarried than that others should run risks in consequence of their union with her.</p>

<p>97. How simply he settled all the questions of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>! They talk about the defects of a house, whether they ought to be concealed or made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the vendor.  Raguel was quite certain that his daughter's faults ought not to be kept secret. And, indeed, he had not been eager to give her up&mdash; he was asked for her. We can have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> how much more nobly he acted than those <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, when we consider how much more important a daughter's future is than some mere money affair.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.</h2>

<p><strong>With what virtuous feelings the fathers of old hid the sacred fires when on the point of going into captivity.</strong></p>

<p>98. Let us consider, again, that deed done at the time of the captivity, which has attained the highest degree of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Virtue is checked by no adversities, for it rises up among them, and prevails here rather than in prosperity. 'Mid chains or arms, 'mid flames or slavery (which is harder for freemen to bear than any punishment), 'midst the pains of the dying, the destruction of their country, the fears of the living, or the blood of the slain,&mdash; amidst all this our forefathers failed not in their care and thought for what is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. Amidst the ashes and dust of their fallen country it glowed and shone forth brightly in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> efforts.</p>

<p>99. For when our fathers were carried away into <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note340711"><a href="../bible/2ma001.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;1:19</a></span> certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who then were in the service of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, secretly buried in the valley the fire taken from the altar of the Lord. There was there an open pit, with no water in it, and not accessible for the wants of the people, in a spot unknown and free from intruders. There they sealed the hidden fire with the sacred mark and in secret. They were not anxious to bury gold or to hide up silver to preserve it for their children, but in their own great peril, thinking of all that was <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, they thought the sacred fire ought to be preserved so that impure men might not defile it, nor the blood of the slain extinguish it, nor the heaps of miserable ruins cover it.</p>

<p>100. So they went to <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, free only in their religion; for that alone could not be torn from them by their captivity. After a length of time,  indeed, according to God's good pleasure, He put it into the Persian king's heart to order the temple in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> to be restored, and the regular customs to be again rebuilt at Jerusalem. To carry out this work of his the Persian king appointed the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Nehemiah. He took with him the grandchildren of those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who on leaving their native soil had hidden the sacred fire to save it from perishing. But on arriving, as we are told in the history of the fathers, they found not fire but water. And when fire was wanting to burn upon the altars, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Nehemiah bade them draw the water, to bring it to him, and to sprinkle it upon the wood. Then, O wondrous sight! Though the sky had been overcast with clouds, suddenly the sun shone forth, a great fire flamed forth, so that all, wonder-stricken at such a clear sign of the favour of the Lord, were filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Nehemiah <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> sang a hymn of praise to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> was completed. Nehemiah again bade the remainder of the water to be poured upon the larger stones. And when this was done a flame burst forth while the light shining from off the altar shone more brightly yet.</p>

<p>101. When this sign became <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, the king of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> ordered a temple to be built on that spot where the fire had been hidden and the water afterwards found, to which many gifts were made. They who were with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Nehemiah called it Naphthar, <span class="stiki" id="note340713"><a href="../bible/2ma001.htm#verse36">2&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;1:36</a></span> &mdash; which means cleansing&mdash; by many it is called Nephi. It is to be found also in the history of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah,  that he bade those who should come after him to take of the fire. That is the fire which fell on <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and consumed it, as it is written: <q>There came a fire out from the Lord and consumed upon the altar all the whole burnt-offering.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340715"><a href="../bible/lev009.htm#verse24">Leviticus&nbsp;9:24</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> must be hallowed with this fire only. Therefore, also, fire went out from the Lord upon the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> who wished to offer strange fire, and consumed them, so that their dead bodies were cast forth without the camp. <span class="stiki" id="note340716"><a href="../bible/lev010.htm#verse2">Leviticus&nbsp;10:2</a></span> </p>

<p>101. Jeremiah coming to a spot found there a house like a cave, and brought into it the tabernacle, the ark, and the altar of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and closed up the entrance. And when those who had come with him examined it rather closely to mark the spot, they could not discover nor find it. When Jeremiah understood what they wanted he said: <q>The spot will remain unknown until God shall gather His people together and be gracious to them. Then God shall reveal these things and the majesty of the Lord shall appear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340717"><a href="../bible/2ma002.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;2:5</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 18.</h2>

<p><strong>In the narration of that event already mentioned, and especially of the sacrifice offered by Nehemiah, is typified the Holy Spirit and Christian baptism. The sacrifice of Moses and Elijah and the history of Noah are also referred to the same.</strong></p>

<p>102. We form the congregation of the Lord. We recognize the propitiation of our Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which our Propitiator wrought in His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>. I think, too, we cannot leave out of sight that fire when we read that the Lord Jesus baptizes with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and with fire, <span class="stiki" id="note340718"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;1:33</a></span> as John said in his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Rightly was the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> consumed, for it was for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But that fire was a type of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> Who was to come down after the Lord's ascension, and forgive the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of all, and Who like fire inflames the mind and faithful heart. Wherefore Jeremiah, after receiving the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, says: <q>It became in my heart as a burning fire flaming in my bones, and I am vile and cannot bear it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340719"><a href="../bible/jer020.htm#verse9">Jeremiah&nbsp;20:9</a></span> In the Acts of the Apostles, also, when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> descended upon the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and those others who were waiting for the Promise of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, we read that tongues as of fire were distributed among them. <span class="stiki" id="note340720"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse3">Acts&nbsp;2:3</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of each one was so uplifted by His influence that they were supposed to be full of new wine, <span class="stiki" id="note340721"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse13">Acts&nbsp;2:13</a></span> who instead had received the gift of a diversity of tongues.</p>

<p>103. What else can this mean&mdash; namely, that fire became water and water called forth fire&mdash; but that spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> burns out our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through fire, and through water cleanses them? For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is washed away and it is burnt away. Wherefore the Apostle says: <q>The fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340722"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:13</a></span> And further on: <q>If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340723"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> </p>

<p>104. This, then, we have stated, so as to prove that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are burnt out by means of fire. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> now that this is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the sacred fire which then, as a type of the future remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, came down upon the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</p>

<p>105. This fire is hidden in the time of captivity, during which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> reigns, but in the time of liberty it is brought forth. And though it is changed into the appearance of water, yet it preserves its nature as fire so as to consume the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. Do not wonder when you read that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father said: <q>I am a consuming fire.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340724"><a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse24">Deuteronomy&nbsp;4:24</a></span> And again: <q>They have forsaken Me, the fountain of living water.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340725"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse13">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:13</a></span> The Lord Jesus, too, like a fire inflamed the hearts of those who heard Him, and like a fount of waters cooled them. For He Himself said in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that He came to send fire on the earth <span class="stiki" id="note340726"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;12:49</a></span> and to supply a draught of living waters to those who thirst. <span class="stiki" id="note340727"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;7:37-38</a></span> </p>

<p>106. In the time of Elijah, also, fire came down when he challenged the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> to light up the altar without fire. When they could not do so, he poured water thrice over his victim, so that the water ran round about the altar; then he cried out and the fire fell from the Lord from heaven and consumed the burnt-offering. </p>

<p>107. You are that victim. Contemplate in silence each single point. The breath of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> descends on you, He seems to burn you when He consumes your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> which was consumed in the time of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, wherefore <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said, as is written in the book of the Maccabees: <q>Because the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was not to be eaten, it was consumed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340729"><a href="../bible/2ma002.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;2:11</a></span> Does it not seem to be consumed for you when in the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the whole outer man perishes? <q>Our old man is crucified,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340730"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;6:6</a></span> the Apostle exclaims. Herein, as the example of the fathers teaches us, the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> is swallowed up&mdash; the Hebrew arises renewed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as he also crossed the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> dryshod&mdash; where our fathers were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the cloud and in the sea. <span class="stiki" id="note340731"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:1-2</a></span> </p>

<p>108. In the flood, too, in <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah's</a> time all flesh died, though just <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> was preserved together with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note340732"><a href="../bible/gen007.htm#verse23">Genesis&nbsp;7:23</a></span> Is not a man consumed when all that is mortal is cut off from life? The outer man is destroyed, but the inner is renewed. Not in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> alone but also in repentance does this destruction of the flesh tend to the growth of the spirit, as we are taught on the Apostle's authority, when <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says: <q>I have judged as though I were present him that has so done this deed, to deliver him unto <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q> </p>

<p>109. We seem to have made a somewhat lengthy digression for the sake of regarding this wonderful <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, in desiring to unfold more fully this sacrament which has been revealed to us, and which, indeed, is as full of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as it is full of religious awe.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.</h2>

<p><strong>The crime committed by the inhabitants of Gibeah against the wife of a certain Levite is related, and from the vengeance taken it is inferred how the idea of virtue must have filled the heart of those people of old.</strong></p>

<p>110. What regard for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> our forefathers had to avenge by a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> the wrongs of one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> which had been brought on her by her violation at the hands of profligate men! Nay, when the people were conquered, they vowed that they would not give their daughters in marriage to the tribe of Benjamin! That tribe had remained without hope of posterity, had they not received leave of necessity to use deceit. And this permission does not seem to fail in giving fitting punishment for violation, since they were only allowed to enter on a union by a rape, and not through the sacrament of marriage. And indeed it was right that they who had broken another's intercourse should themselves lose their marriage <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>.</p>

<p>111. How full of pitiful traits is this story! A man, it says, <span class="stiki" id="note340734"><a href="../bible/jdg019.htm#verse1">Judges&nbsp;19:1-3</a></span> a Levite, had taken to himself a wife, who I suppose was called a concubine from the word <q>concubitus.</q> She some time afterwards, as is wont to happen, offended at certain things, betook herself to her father, and was with him four months. Then her husband arose and went to the house of his father-in-law, to reconcile himself with his wife, to win her back and take her home again. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> ran to meet him and brought her husband into her father's house.</p>

<p>112. The maiden's <span class="stiki" id="note340735"><a href="../bible/jdg004.htm">Judges&nbsp;4-9</a></span> father rejoiced and went to meet him, and the man stayed with him three days, and they ate and rested. On the next day the Levite arose at daybreak, but was detained by his father-in-law, that he might not so quickly lose the pleasure of his company. Again on the next and the third day the maiden's father did not suffer his son-in-law to start, until their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and mutual regard was complete. But on the seventh day, when it was already drawing to a close, after a pleasant meal, having urged the approach of the coming night, so as to make him think he ought to sleep among friends rather than strangers, he was unable to keep him, and so let him go together with his daughter.</p>

<p>113. When some little progress <span class="stiki" id="note340736"><a href="../bible/jdg019.htm#verse10">Judges&nbsp;19:10-21</a></span> was made, though night was threatening to come on, and they were close by the town of the Jebusites, on the slave's request that his lord should turn aside there, he refused, because it was not a city of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. He meant to get as far as Gibeah, which was inhabited by the people of the tribe of Benjamin. But when they arrived there was no one to receive them with hospitality, except a stranger of advanced age&mdash; When he had looked upon them he asked the Levite: Where are you going, and where are you coming from? On his answering that he was travelling and was making for Mount Ephraim and that there was no one to take him in, the old man offered him hospitality and prepared a meal.</p>

<p>114. And when they were satisfied <span class="stiki" id="note340737"><a href="../bible/jdg019.htm#verse22">Judges&nbsp;19:22-26</a></span> and the tables were removed, vile men rushed up and surrounded the house. Then the old man offered these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men his daughter, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and the concubine with whom she shared her bed, only that <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> might not be inflicted on his guest. But when reason did no good and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> prevailed, the Levite parted from his wife, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> her and abused her all that night. Overcome by this cruelty or by grief at her wrong, she fell at the door of their host where her husband had entered, and gave up the ghost, with the last effort of her life guarding the feelings of a good wife so as to preserve for her husband at least her mortal remains.</p>

<p>115. When this became <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>  (to be brief) almost all the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> broke out into <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> remained doubtful with an uncertain issue, but in the third engagement the people of Benjamin were delivered to the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note340739"><a href="../bible/jdg020.htm#verse48">Judges&nbsp;20:48</a></span> and being condemned by the divine judgment paid the penalty for their profligacy. The sentence, further,  was that none of the people of the fathers should give his daughter in marriage to them. This was confirmed by a solemn <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. But relenting at having laid so hard a sentence on their brethren, they moderated their severity so as to give them in marriage those maidens that had lost their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, whose fathers had been slain for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or to give them the means of finding a wife by a raid. Because of the villainy of so foul a deed, they who have violated another's marriage rights were shown to be unworthy to ask for marriage. But for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that one tribe might perish from the people, they connived at the deceit.</p>

<p>116. What great regard our forefathers had for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is shown by the fact that forty thousand men drew the sword against their brethren of the tribe of Benjamin in their desire to avenge the wrong done to modesty, for they would not endure the violation of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. And so in that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on both sides there fell sixty-five thousand warriors, while their cities were burnt. And when at first the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were defeated, yet unmoved by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> at the reverses of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, they disregarded the sorrow the avenging of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> cost them. They rushed into the battle ready to wash out with their own blood the stains of the crime that had been committed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.</h2>

<p><strong>After the terrible siege of Samaria was ended in accordance with Elisha's prophecy, he relates what regard the four lepers showed for what was virtuous.</strong></p>

<p>117. Why need we wonder that the people of the Lord had regard for what was seemly and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> when even the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>&mdash; as we read in the books of the Kings&mdash; showed concern for what is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>?</p>

<p>118. There was a great famine in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>,  for the army of the Syrians was besieging it. The king in his anxiety was making the round of the guards on the walls when a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> addressed him, saying: This <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> persuaded me to give up my son&mdash; and I gave him up, and we boiled him and ate him. And she promised that she would afterwards bring her son and that we should eat his flesh together, but now she has hidden her son and will not bring him. The king was troubled because these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> seemed to have fed not merely on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies, but on the bodies of their own children; and being moved by an example of such awful misery, threatened the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Elisha with death. For he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it was in his power to break up the siege and to avert the famine; or else he was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> because the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had not allowed the king to smite the Syrians whom he had struck with blindness. </p>

<p>119. Elisha sat  with the elders at Bethel, and before the king's messenger came to him he said to the elders: <q>See ye how the son of that murderess has sent to take away mine head?</q> Then the messenger entered and brought the king's command threatening instant danger to his life. Him the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> answered:  <q>Tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</q> Then when the messenger sent by the king would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it, saying: <q>If the Lord would rain abundance of grain from heaven, not even so would that come about,</q> Elisha said to him: <q>Because you have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat of it.</q></p>

<p>120. And suddenly  in the camp of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> was there heard, as it were, a sound of chariots and a loud noise of horses and the noise of a great host, and the tumult of some vast battle. And the Syrians thought that the king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had called to his help in the battle the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the king of the Amorites, and they fled at dawn leaving their tents, for they feared that they might be crushed by the sudden arrival of fresh foes, and would not be able to withstand the united forces of the kings. This was unknown in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, for they dared not go out of the town, being overcome with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and also being weak through hunger.</p>

<p>121. But there were four <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>  at the gate of the city to whom life was a misery, and to die would be gain. And they said one to another: <q>Behold we sit here and die. If we enter into the city, we shall die with hunger; if we remain here, there are no means of living at hand for us. Let us go to the Syrian camp, either they will quickly kill us or grant us the means of safety.</q> So they went and entered into the camp, and behold, all was forsaken by the enemy. Entering  the tents, first of all on finding food they satisfied their hunger, then they laid hold of as much gold and silver as they could. But while they were intent on the booty alone, they arranged to announce to the king that the Syrians had fled, for they thought this more <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> than to withhold the information and keep for themselves the plunder gained by deceit.</p>

<p>122. At this information the people  went forth and plundered the Syrian camp. The supplies of the enemy produced an abundance, and brought about cheapness of grain according to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> word: <q>A measure of fine flour for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel.</q> In this rejoicing of the people, that officer on whose hand the king leaned died, being crushed and trodden under foot by the people as the crowds kept hurrying to go out or returned with great rejoicing.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.</h2>

<p><strong>Esther in danger of her life followed the grace of virtue; nay, even a heathen king did so, when death was threatened to a man most friendly to him. For friendship must ever be combined with virtue, as the examples of Jonathan and Ahimelech show.</strong></p>

<p>123. Why did Queen Esther <span class="stiki" id="note340749"><a href="../bible/est004.htm#verse16">Esther&nbsp;4:16</a></span> expose herself to death and not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of a fierce king? Was it not to save her people from death, an act both seemly and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>? The king of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> himself also, though fierce and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, yet thought it seemly to show <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the man who had given information about a plot which had been laid against himself, <span class="stiki" id="note340750"><a href="../bible/est006.htm#verse10">Esther&nbsp;6:10</a></span> to save a free people from slavery, to snatch them from death, and not to spare him who had pressed on such unseemly plans. So finally he handed over to the gallows <span class="stiki" id="note340751"><a href="../bible/est007.htm#verse9">Esther&nbsp;7:9-10</a></span> the man that stood second to himself, and whom he counted chief among all his friends, because he considered that he had dishonoured him by his false counsels.</p>

<p>124. For that commendable friendship which maintains <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is to be preferred most certainly to <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, or honours, or power. It is not wont to be preferred to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> indeed, but to follow after it.  So it was with Jonathan,  who for his affection's sake avoided not his father's displeasure nor the danger to his own safety. So, too, it was with Ahimelech, who, to preserve the duties of hospitality, thought he must endure death rather than betray his friend when fleeing. </p>

<h2>Chapter 22.</h2>

<p><strong>Virtue must never be given up for the sake of a friend. If, however, one has to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against a friend, it must be done with caution. Between friends what candour is needed in opening the heart, what magnanimity in suffering, what freedom in finding fault! Friendship is the guardian of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which are not to be found but in men of like character. It must be mild in rebuking and averse to seeking its own advantage; whence it happens that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> friends are scarce among the rich. What is the dignity of friendship? The treachery of a friend, as it is worse, so it is also more hateful than another's, as is recognized from the example of Judas and of Job's friends.</strong></p>

<p>125. Nothing, then, must be set before <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and that it may never be set aside by the desire for friendship, Scripture also gives us a warning on the subject of friendship. There are, indeed various questions raised among <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>;  for instance whether a man ought for the sake of a friend to plot against his country or not, so as to serve his friend? Whether it is right to break one's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and so aid and maintain a friend's advantage?</p>

<p>126. And Scripture also says: <q>A maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow, so is a man that bears false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against his friend.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340756"><a href="../bible/pro025.htm#verse18">Proverbs&nbsp;25:18</a></span> But note what it adds. It blames not <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> given against a friend, but false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. For what if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of God or of one's country compels one to give <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>? Ought friendship to take a higher place than our religion, or our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for our fellow citizens? In these matters, however, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is required so that a friend may not be assailed by the treachery of a friend, by whose good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he ought to be acquitted. A man, then, ought never to please a friend who desires <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or to plot against one who is innocent.</p>

<p>127. Certainly, if it is necessary to give <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, then, when one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of any fault in a friend, one ought to rebuke him secretly&mdash; if he does not listen, one must do it openly. For rebukes are good,  and often better than a silent friendship. Even if a friend thinks himself hurt, still rebuke him; and if the bitterness of the correction wounds his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, still rebuke him and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not. <q>The wounds of a friend are better than the kisses of flatterers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340758"><a href="../bible/pro027.htm#verse6">Proverbs&nbsp;27:6</a></span> Rebuke, then, your erring friend; forsake not an innocent one. For friendship ought to be steadfast  and to rest firm in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> affection. We ought not to change our friends in childish fashion at some idle fancy.</p>

<p>128. Open your breast to a friend that he may be faithful to you, and that you may receive from him the delight of your life. <q>For a faithful friend is the medicine of life and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340760"><a href="../bible/sir006.htm#verse16">Sirach&nbsp;6:16</a></span> Give way to a friend as to an equal, and be not ashamed to be beforehand with your friend in doing kindly duties. For friendship <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. So the wise man says: <q>Do not blush to greet a friend.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340761"><a href="../bible/sir022.htm#verse25">Sirach&nbsp;22:25</a></span> Do not desert a friend in time of need, nor forsake him nor fail him, for friendship is the support of life. Let us then bear our burdens as the Apostle has taught: <span class="stiki" id="note340762"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse2">Galatians&nbsp;6:2</a></span> for he spoke to those whom the charity of the same one body had embraced together. If friends in prosperity help friends, why do they not also in times of adversity offer their support? Let us aid by giving counsel, let us offer our best endeavours, let us sympathize with them with all our heart.</p>

<p>129. If necessary, let us endure for a friend even hardship. Often enmity has to be borne for the sake of a friend's innocence; oftentimes revilings, if one defends and answers for a friend who is found fault with and accused. Do not be afraid of such displeasure, for the voice of the just says: <q>Though <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> come upon me, I will endure it for a friend's sake.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340763"><a href="../bible/sir022.htm#verse26">Sirach&nbsp;22:26</a></span> In adversity, too, a friend is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, for in prosperity all seem to be friends. But as in adversity patience and endurance are needed, so in prosperity strong influence is wanted to check and confute the arrogance of a friend who becomes overbearing.</p>

<p>130. How nobly Job when he was in adversity said: <q>Pity me, my friends, pity me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340764"><a href="../bible/job019.htm#verse21">Job&nbsp;19:21</a></span> That is not a cry as it were of misery, but rather one of blame. For when he was <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> reproached by his friends, he answered: <q>Pity me, my friends,</q> that is, you ought to show pity, but instead ye assail and overwhelm a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with whose sufferings ye ought to show sympathy for friendship's sake.</p>

<p>131. Preserve, then, my sons, that friendship you have begun with your brethren, for nothing in the world is more beautiful than that. It is indeed a comfort in this life to have one to whom you can open your heart,  with whom you can share confidences, and to whom you can entrust the secrets of your heart. It is a comfort to have a trusty man by your side, who will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with you in prosperity, sympathize in troubles, encourage in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. What good friends those Hebrew children were whom the flames of the fiery furnace did not separate from their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of each other!  Of them we have already spoken. Holy David says well: <q>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant, inseparable in their life, in death they were not divided.</q> </p>

<p>132. This is the fruit of friendship; and so <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>  may not be put aside for the sake of friendship. He cannot be a friend to a man who has been unfaithful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Friendship is the guardian of pity and the teacher of equality, so as to make the superior equal to the inferior, and the inferior to the superior.  For there can be no friendship between diverse characters,  and so the good-will of either ought to be mutually suited to the other. Let not authority be wanting to the inferior if the matter demands it, nor humility to the superior. Let him listen to the other as though he were of like position&mdash; an equal, and let the other warn and reprove like a friend, not from a desire to show off, but with a deep feeling of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p>134. Let not your warning be harsh, nor your rebuke bitter,  for as friendship ought to avoid flattery, so, too, ought it to be free from arrogance. For what is a friend but a partner in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,  to whom you unite and attachest your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with whom you blend so as to desire from being two to become one; to whom you entrust yourself as to a second self, from whom you fear nothing, and from whom you demand nothing dishonourable for the sake of your own advantage. Friendship is not meant as a source of revenue,  but is full of seemliness, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Friendship is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not a way of making money. It is produced, not by money, but by esteem; not by the offer of rewards, but by a mutual rivalry in doing kindnesses.</p>

<p>134. Lastly, the friendships of the poor are generally better than those of the rich,  and often the rich are without friends, while the poor have many. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> friendship cannot exist where there is lying flattery. Many try fawningly to please the rich, but no one cares to make pretence to a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man. Whatsoever is stated to a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, his friendship is free from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>.</p>

<p>135. What is more precious than friendship which is shared alike by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and by men? Wherefore the Lord Jesus says: <q>Make to yourselves friends of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of unrighteousness, that they may receive you into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> habitations.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340775"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;16:9</a></span> God Himself makes us friends instead of servants, as He Himself says: <q>You are My friends if you do whatsoever I command you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340776"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;15:14</a></span> He gave us a pattern of friendship to follow. We are to fulfil the wish of a friend, to unfold to him our secrets which we hold in our own hearts, and are not to disregard his confidences. Let us show him our heart and he will open his to us. Therefore He says: <q>I have called you friends, for I have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto you all things whatsoever I have heard of My Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340777"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;15:15</a></span> A friend, then, if he is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one, hides nothing; he pours forth his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as the Lord Jesus poured forth the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of His Father.</p>

<p>136. So he who does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is His friend and is honoured with this name. He who is of one mind with Him, he too is His friend. For there is unity of mind in friends, and no one is more hateful than the man that injures friendship. Hence in the traitor the Lord found this the worst point on which to condemn his treachery, namely, that he gave no sign of gratitude and had mingled the poison of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> at the table of friendship. So He says: <q>It was thou, a man of like <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, My guide and Mine acquaintance, who ever took pleasant meals with Me.</q>  That is: it could not be endured, for you fell upon Him Who granted <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to you. <q>For if My enemy had reproached Me I could have borne it,  and I would have hid Myself from him who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> Me.</q> An enemy can be avoided; a friend cannot, if he desires to lay a plot. Let us guard against him to whom we do not entrust our plans; we cannot guard against him to whom we have already entrusted them. And so to show up all the hatefulness of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> He did not say: Thou, My servant, My apostle; but thou, a man of like mind with Me; that is: you are not My but your own betrayer, for you betrayed a man of like mind with yourself.</p>

<p>137. The Lord Himself, when He was displeased with the three princes who had not deferred to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Job, wished to pardon them through their friend, so that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of friendship might win remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore Job asked and God pardoned. Friendship helped them whom arrogance had harmed. <span class="stiki" id="note340780"><a href="../bible/job042.htm#verse7">Job&nbsp;42:7-8</a></span> </p>

<p>138. These things I have left with you, my children, that you may guard them in your minds&mdash; you yourselves will prove whether they will be of any advantage. Meanwhile they offer you a large number of examples, for almost all the examples drawn from our forefathers, and also many a word of theirs, are included within these three books; so that, although the language may not be graceful, yet a succession of old-time examples set down in such small compass may offer much instruction.</p>
