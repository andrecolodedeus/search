<h1>On the Flesh of Christ</h1>


<p> <em>This was written by our author in confutation of certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who denied the reality of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh, or at least its identity with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh&mdash; fearing that, if they admitted the reality of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh, they must also admit his resurrection in the flesh; and, consequently, the resurrection of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body after death.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1. The General Purport of This Work. The Heretics, Marcion, Apelles, and Valentinus, Wishing to Impugn the Doctrine of the Resurrection, Deprive Christ of All Capacity for Such a Change by Denying His Flesh</h2>

<p>They who are so anxious to shake that belief in the resurrection which was firmly settled  before the appearance of our modern <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>,  as even to deny that the expectation thereof has any relation whatever to the flesh, have great <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for besetting the flesh of Christ also with doubtful questions, as if it either had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> at all, or possessed a nature altogether different from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh. <em>For they cannot but be apprehensive</em> that, if it be once determined that <em>Christ's flesh</em> was <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, a presumption would immediately arise in opposition to them, that that flesh must by all means rise again, which has already risen in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore we shall have to guard our belief in the resurrection  from the same armoury, whence they get their weapons of destruction. Let us examine our Lord's bodily substance, for about His spiritual nature all are agreed.  It is His flesh that is in question. Its verity and quality are the points in dispute. Did it ever exist? Whence was it derived? And of what kind was it? If we succeed in demonstrating it, we shall lay down a law for our own resurrection. <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, in order that he might deny the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, denied also His nativity, or else he denied His flesh in order that he might deny His nativity; because, of course, he was afraid that His nativity and His flesh bore mutual testimony to each other's reality, since there is no nativity without flesh, and no flesh without nativity. As if indeed, under the prompting of that licence which is ever the same in all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, he too might not very well have either denied the nativity, although admitting the flesh&mdash;like <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a>, who was first a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of his, and afterwards an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>&mdash;or, while admitting both the flesh and the nativity, have interpreted them in a different sense, as did <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, who resembled <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a> both in his discipleship and desertion <em>of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a></em>. At all events, he who represented the flesh of Christ to be imaginary was equally able to pass off His nativity as a phantom; so that the virgin's conception, and pregnancy, and child-bearing, and then the whole course  of her infant too, would have to be regarded as putative.  <em>These facts pertaining to the nativity of Christ</em> would escape the notice of the same eyes and the same senses as failed to grasp the full idea  of His flesh.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Marcion, Who Would Blot Out the Record of Christ's Nativity, is Rebuked for So Startling a Heresy</h2>

<p>Clearly enough is the nativity announced by Gabriel. <span class="stiki" id="note036947"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;1:26-38</a></span> But what has he to do with the Creator's <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>?  The conception in the virgin's womb is also set plainly before us. But what concern has he with the Creator's <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, Isaiah?  He  will not brook delay, since <em>suddenly</em> (without any prophetic announcement) did he bring down Christ from heaven.  <q>Away,</q> says he, <q>with that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> plaguey taxing of C&aelig;sar, and the scanty inn, and the squalid swaddling-clothes, and the hard stable. <span class="stiki" id="note036952"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;2:1-7</a></span> We do not care a jot for  that multitude of the heavenly host which praised their Lord at night. <span class="stiki" id="note036954"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;2:13</a></span> Let the shepherds take better care of their flock, <span class="stiki" id="note036955"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;2:8</a></span> and let the wise men spare their legs so long a journey; <span class="stiki" id="note036956"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;2:1</a></span> let them keep their gold to themselves. <span class="stiki" id="note036957"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;2:11</a></span> Let <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, too, mend his manners, so that Jeremy may not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> over him.  Spare also the babe from <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, that he may escape the pain thereof; nor let him be brought into the temple, lest he burden his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> with the expense of the offering; <span class="stiki" id="note036959"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;2:22-24</a></span> nor let him be handed to Simeon, lest the old man be saddened at the point of death. <span class="stiki" id="note036960"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;2:25-35</a></span> Let that old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> also hold her tongue, lest she should bewitch the child.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note036961"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse36">Luke&nbsp;2:36-38</a></span> After such a fashion as this, I suppose you have had, O <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, the hardihood of blotting out the original records (of the history) of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that His flesh may lose the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of its reality. But, prithee, on what grounds (do you do this)? Show me your authority. If you are a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, foretell us a thing; if you are an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, open your message in public; if a follower of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,  side with <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in thought; if you are only a (private) <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what has been handed down to us: if, however, you are nothing of all this, then (as I have the best reason to say) cease to live.  For indeed you are already dead, since you are no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, because you do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that which by being <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> makes men <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>&mdash;nay, you are the more dead, the more you are not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; having fallen away, after you had been one, by rejecting  what you formerly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, even as you yourself acknowledge in a certain letter of yours, and as your followers do not deny, while our (brethren) can prove it.  Rejecting, therefore, what you <em>once</em> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, you have completed the act of rejection, by now no longer believing: the fact, however, of your having ceased to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> has not made your rejection of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> right and proper; nay, rather,  by your act of rejection you prove that what you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> previous to the said act was of a different character.  What you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be of a different character, had been handed down just as <em>you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it</em>. Now  that which had been handed down was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, inasmuch as it had been transmitted by those whose duty it was to hand it down. Therefore, when rejecting that which had been handed down, you rejected that which was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. You had no authority for what you did. However, we have already in another treatise availed ourselves more fully of these prescriptive rules against all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. Our repetition of them hereafter that large (treatise) is superfluous,  when we ask the reason why you have formed the opinion that Christ was not born.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Christ's Nativity Both Possible and Becoming. The Heretical Opinion of Christ's Apparent Flesh Deceptive and Dishonourable to God, Even on Marcion's Principles</h2>

<p>Since  you think that this lay within the competency of your own arbitrary choice, you must needs have supposed that being born  was either impossible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or unbecoming to Him. With <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, nothing is impossible but what He does not will. Let us consider, then, whether He willed to be born (for if He had the will, He also had the power, and was born). I put the argument very briefly. If God had willed not to be born, it matters not why, He would not have presented Himself in the likeness of man. Now who, when he sees a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, would deny that he had been born? What <em>God</em> therefore willed not to be, He would in no wise have willed the seeming to be. When a thing is distasteful, the very notion  of it is scouted; because it makes no difference whether a thing exist or do not exist, if, when it does not exist, it is yet assumed to exist. It is of course of the greatest importance that there should be nothing false (<em>or pretended</em>) attributed to that which really does not exist.  But, say you, His own consciousness (of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His nature) was enough for Him. If any supposed that He had been born, because they saw Him as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that was their concern.  Yet with how much more dignity and consistency would He have sustained the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> character on the supposition that He was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born; <em>for</em> if He were not born, He could not have undertaken the said character without injury to that consciousness of His which you on your side attribute to <em>His</em> confidence of being able to sustain, although not born, the character of having been born even against! His own consciousness!  Why, I want to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,  was it of so much importance, that Christ should, when perfectly aware what He really was, exhibit Himself as being that which He was not? You cannot express any apprehension that,  if He had been born and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> clothed Himself with man's nature, He would have ceased to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, losing what He was, while becoming what He was not. For God is in no danger of losing His own state and condition. But, say you, I deny that God was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> changed to man in such wise as to be born and endued with a body of flesh, on this ground, that a being who is without end is also of necessity incapable of change. For being changed into something else puts an end to the former state. Change, therefore, is not possible to a Being who cannot come to an end. Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things which are subject to change is regulated by this law, that they have no permanence in the state which is undergoing change in them, and that they come to an end from thus wanting permanence, while they lose that in the process of change which they previously were. But nothing is equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; His nature is different  from the condition of all things. If, then, the things which differ from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>and</em> from which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> differs, lose what <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> they had while they are undergoing change, wherein will consist the difference of the Divine Being from all other things except in His possessing the contrary faculty of theirs&mdash;in other words, that God can be changed into all conditions, and yet continue just as He is? On any other supposition, He would be on the same level with those things which, when changed, lose the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> they had before; whose equal, of course, He is not in any other respect, as He certainly is not in the changeful issues  <em>of their nature</em>. You have sometimes read and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the Creator's <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have been changed into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form, and have even borne about so veritable a body, that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> even washed their feet, <span class="stiki" id="note036980"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm">Genesis&nbsp;xviii</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> was rescued from the Sodomites by their hands; <span class="stiki" id="note036981"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm">Genesis&nbsp;xix</a></span> an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, moreover, wrestled with a man so strenuously with his body, that the latter desired to be let loose, so tightly was he held. <span class="stiki" id="note036982"><a href="../bible/gen032.htm">Genesis&nbsp;xxxii</a></span> Has it, then, been permitted to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, which are inferior to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, after they have been changed into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodily form,  nevertheless to remain <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>? And will you deprive <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, their superior, of this faculty, as if Christ could not continue to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, after His real assumption of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of man? Or else, did those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> appear as phantoms of flesh? You will not, however, have the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to say this; for if it be so held in your belief, that the Creator's <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are in the same condition as Christ, then Christ will belong to the same God as those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do, who are like Christ in their condition. If you had not purposely rejected in some instances, and corrupted in others, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which are opposed to your opinion, you would have been confuted in this matter by the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Gospel of John</a>, when it declares that the Spirit descended in the body  of a dove, and sat upon the Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note036985"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;3:16</a></span> When the said Spirit was in this condition, He was as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a dove as He was also a spirit; nor did He destroy His own proper substance by the assumption of an extraneous substance. But you ask what becomes of the dove's body, after the return of the Spirit back to heaven, and similarly in the case of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Their withdrawal was effected in the same manner as their appearance had been. If you had seen how their production out of nothing had been effected, you would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> also the process of their return to nothing. If the initial step was out of sight, so was also the final one. Still there was solidity in their bodily substance, whatever may have been the force by which the body became visible. What is written cannot but have been.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. God's Honour in the Incarnation of His Son Vindicated. Marcion's Disparagement of Human Flesh Inconsistent as Well as Impious. Christ Has Cleansed the Flesh. The Foolishness of God is Most Wise</h2>

<p>Since, therefore, you do not reject the assumption of a body  as impossible or as hazardous to the character of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it remains for you to repudiate and censure it as unworthy of Him. Come now, beginning from the nativity itself, declaim  against the uncleanness of the generative elements within the womb, the filthy concretion of fluid and blood, of the growth of the flesh for nine months long out of that very mire. Describe the womb as it enlarges  from day to day, heavy, troublesome, restless even in sleep, changeful in its feelings of dislike and desire. Inveigh now likewise against the shame itself of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in travail  which, however, ought rather to be honoured in consideration of that peril, or to be held sacred  in respect of (the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of) nature. Of course you are horrified also at the infant, which is shed into life with the embarrassments which accompany it from the womb;  you likewise, of course, loathe it even after it is washed, when it is dressed out in its swaddling-clothes, graced with repeated anointing,  smiled on with nurse's fawns. This reverend course of nature,  you, O <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, (are pleased to) spit upon; and yet, in what way were you born? You detest a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being at his birth; then after what fashion do you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> anybody? Yourself, of course, you had no <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of, when you departed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But never <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,  if you are not on good terms with yourself, or even if you were born in a way different from other people. Christ, at any rate, has loved even that man who was condensed in his mother's womb amidst all its uncleannesses, even that man who was brought into life out of the said womb, even that man who was nursed amidst the nurse's simpers.  For his sake He came down (from heaven), for his sake He preached, for his sake <q>He humbled Himself even unto death&mdash; the death of the cross.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note036996"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> He loved, of course, the being whom He redeemed at so great a cost. If Christ is the Creator's <em>Son</em>, it was with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that He loved His own (creature); if He comes from another god, His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> was excessive, since He redeemed a being who belonged to another. Well, then, loving man He loved his nativity also, and his flesh as well. Nothing can be loved apart from that through which whatever exists has its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Either take away nativity, and then show us <em>your</em> man; or else withdraw the flesh, and then present to our view the being whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has redeemed&mdash; since it is these very conditions  which constitute the man whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has redeemed. And are <em>you</em> for turning these conditions into occasions of blushing to the very creature whom He has redeemed, (censuring them), too, as unworthy of Him who certainly would not have redeemed them had He not loved them? Our birth He reforms from death by a second birth from heaven;  our flesh He restores from every harassing malady; when <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprous</a>, He cleanses it of the stain; when blind, He rekindles its light; when palsied, He renews its strength; when possessed with devils, He exorcises it; when dead, He reanimates it&mdash;then shall <em>we</em> blush to own it? If, to be sure,  He had chosen to be born of a mere animal, and were to preach the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> invested with the body of a beast either wild or tame, your censure (I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>) would have instantly met Him with this demurrer: <q>This is disgraceful for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is unworthy of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and simply foolish.</q> For no other reason than because one thus judges. It <em>is</em> of course foolish, if we are to judge God by our own conceptions. But, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, consider well this Scripture, if indeed you have not erased it: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has chosen the foolish things of the world, to confound the wise.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037000"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:27</a></span> Now what are those foolish things? Are they the conversion of men to the worship of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the rejection of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, the whole training in righteousness, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, mercy, patience, and innocence? These things certainly are not <q>foolish.</q> Inquire again, then, of what things he spoke, and when you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that you have discovered what they are will you find anything to be so <q>foolish</q> as believing in a God that has been born, and that of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and of a fleshly nature too, who wallowed in all the before-mentioned humiliations of nature? But some one may say, <q>These are not the foolish things; they must be other things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has chosen to confound the wisdom of the world.</q> And yet, according to the world's wisdom, it is more easy to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Jupiter became a bull or a swan, if we listen to <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, than that Christ really became a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</p>

<p>There are, to be sure, other things also quite as foolish (as the birth of Christ), which have reference to the humiliations and sufferings of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Or else, let them call a crucified God <q>wisdom.</q> But <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> will apply the knife  to this <em>doctrine</em> also, and even with greater reason. For which is more unworthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is more likely to raise a blush of shame, that <em>God</em> should be born, or that He should die? That He should bear the flesh, or the cross? Be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, or be crucified? Be cradled, or be coffined?  be laid in a <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>, or in a tomb? <em>Talk of</em> <q> <em>wisdom</em>!</q> You will show more of <em>that</em> if you refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this also. But, after all, you will not be <q>wise</q> unless you become a <q>fool</q> to the world, by believing <q>the foolish things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Have you, then, cut away  all sufferings from Christ, on the ground that, as a mere phantom, He was incapable of experiencing them? We have said above that He might possibly have undergone the unreal mockeries  of an imaginary birth and infancy. But answer me at once, you that <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: Was not God really crucified? And, having been really crucified, did He not really die? And, having indeed really died, did He not really rise again? Falsely did <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>  <q>determine to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing among us but Jesus and Him crucified;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037006"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:2</a></span> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> has he impressed upon us that He was buried; <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> inculcated that He rose again. False, therefore, is our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> also. And all that we hope for from Christ will be a phantom. O you most <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who acquittest of all guilt  the murderers of God! For nothing did Christ suffer from them, if He really suffered nothing at all. Spare the whole world's one only hope, you who are destroying the indispensable dishonour of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.  Whatsoever is unworthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is of gain to me. I am safe, if I am not ashamed of my Lord. <q>Whosoever,</q> says He, <q>shall be ashamed of me, of him will I also be ashamed.</q>  Other matters for shame find I none which can prove me to be shameless in a good sense, and foolish in a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> one, by my own contempt of shame. The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was crucified; I am not ashamed because men must needs be ashamed <em>of it</em>. And the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> died; it is by all means to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, because it is absurd.  And He was buried, and rose again; the fact is certain, because it is impossible. But how will all this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in Him, if He was not Himself <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>&mdash; if He really had not in Himself that which might be crucified, might die, might be buried, and might rise again? <em>I mean</em> this flesh suffused with blood, built up with bones, interwoven with nerves, entwined with veins, <em>a flesh</em> which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to be born, and how to die, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, as born of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being. It will therefore be mortal in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because Christ is man and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>. Else why is Christ man and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, if he has nothing of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and nothing from man? Unless it be either that man is anything else than flesh, or man's flesh comes from any other source than man, or Mary is anything else than a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, or <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> man is <em>as</em> <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> god.  Otherwise Christ could not be described as being man without flesh, nor the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> without any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> parent; just as He is not God without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> without having God for His father. Thus the nature  of the two substances displayed Him as man and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;in one respect born, in the other unborn; in one respect fleshly, in the other spiritual; in one sense weak, in the other exceeding strong; in one sense dying, in the other living. This property of the two states&mdash; the divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>&mdash; is distinctly asserted  with equal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of both natures alike, with the same belief both in respect of the Spirit  and of the flesh. The powers of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>,  <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> Him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, His sufferings attested the flesh of man. If His powers were not without the Spirit  in like manner, were not His sufferings without the flesh. If His flesh with its sufferings was fictitious, for the same reason was the Spirit false with all its powers. Wherefore halve  Christ with a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>? He was wholly the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Believe me, He chose rather to be born, than in any part to pretend&mdash; and that indeed to His own detriment&mdash; that He was bearing about a flesh hardened without bones, solid without muscles, bloody without blood, clothed without the tunic <em>of skin</em>,  hungry without appetite, eating without teeth, speaking without a tongue, so that His word was a phantom to the ears through an imaginary voice. A phantom, too, it was of course after the resurrection, when, showing His hands and His feet for the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to examine, He said, <q>Behold and see that it is I myself, for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037019"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;24:39</a></span> without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, hands, and feet, and bones are not what a spirit possesses, but <em>only</em> the flesh. How do you interpret this statement, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, you who tell us that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> comes only from the most excellent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is both simple and good? See how He <em>rather</em> cheats, and deceives, and juggles the eyes of all, and the senses of all, as well as their access to and contact with Him! You ought rather to have brought Christ down, not from heaven, but from some troop of mountebanks, not as God besides man, but simply as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, a magician; not as the High Priest of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but as the conjurer in a show; not as the raiser of the dead, but as the misleader  of the living,&mdash; except that, if He were a magician, He must have had a nativity!</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. The Doctrine of Apelles Refuted, that Christ's Body Was of Sidereal Substance, Not Born. Nativity and Mortality are Correlative Circumstances, and in Christ's Case His Death Proves His Birth</h2>

<p>But certain <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>  of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, compelled to be wiser than their teacher, concede to Christ real flesh, without effect, however, on  their denial of His nativity. He might have had, they say, a flesh which was not at all born. So we have found our way <q>out of a frying-pan,</q> as the proverb runs, <q>into the fire,</q> &mdash; from <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> to <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a>. This man having first fallen from the principles of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> into (intercourse with) a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, in the flesh, and afterwards shipwrecked himself, in the spirit, on the virgin Philumene,  proceeded from that <em>time</em>  to preach that the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was of solid flesh, but without having been born. To this <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, indeed, of Philumene, the apostle will reply in tones like those in which he even then predicted him, saying, <q>Although an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037026"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;1:8</a></span> To the arguments, however, which have been indicated just above, we have now to show our resistance. They allow that Christ really had a body. Whence was the material of it, if not from the same sort of thing as  that in which He appeared? Whence came His body, if His body were not flesh? Whence came His flesh, if it were not born? Inasmuch as that which is born must undergo this nativity in order to become flesh. He borrowed, they say, His flesh from the stars, and from the substances of the higher world. And they assert it for a certain principle, that a body without nativity is nothing to be astonished at, because it has been submitted to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to appear even among ourselves in the flesh without the intervention of the womb. We admit, of course, that such facts have been related. But then, how comes it to pass that a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which holds to a different rule borrows materials for its own arguments from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which it impugns? What has it to do with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who has rejected the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? Since the God is a different one, everything belonging to him must be different also. But let the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> always use the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of that God whose world they also enjoy. The fact will certainly recoil on them as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to judge them, that they maintain their own <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> from examples derived from <em>Him</em>.  But it is an easy task for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to prevail without raising any such demurrer against them. When, therefore, they set forth the flesh of Christ after the pattern of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, declaring it to be not born, and yet flesh for all that, I should wish them to compare the causes, both in Christ's case and that of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, wherefore they came in the flesh. Never did any <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> descend for the purpose of being crucified, of tasting death, <em>and</em> of rising again from the dead. Now, since there never was such a reason for <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> becoming embodied, you have the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why they assumed flesh without undergoing birth. They had not come to die, therefore they also (came not) to be born. Christ, however, having been sent to die, had necessarily to be also born, that He might be capable of death; for nothing is in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of dying but that which is born. Between nativity and mortality there is a mutual contrast. The law  which makes us die is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our being born. Now, since Christ died owing to the condition which undergoes death, but that undergoes death which is also born, the consequence was&mdash; nay, it was an antecedent necessity&mdash; that He must have been born also,  by reason of the condition which undergoes birth; because He had to die in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to that very condition which, because it begins with birth, ends in death.  It was not fitting for Him not to be born under the pretence  that it was fitting for Him to die. But the Lord Himself at that very time appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> among those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> without being born, and yet in the flesh without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, in virtue of the before-mentioned diversity of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. You, however, cannot admit this, since you do not receive that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who was even then rehearsing  how to converse with, and liberate, and judge the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of a flesh which as yet was not born, because it did not yet mean to die until both its nativity and mortality were previously (by <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>) announced. Let them, then, prove to us that those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> derived their flesh from the stars. If they do not prove it because it is not written, neither will the flesh of Christ get its origin therefrom, for which they borrowed the precedent of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. It is plain that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> bore a flesh which was not naturally their own; their nature being of a spiritual substance, although in some sense peculiar to themselves, corporeal; and yet they could be transfigured into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> shape, and for the time be able to appear and have intercourse with men. Since, therefore, it has not been told us whence they obtained their flesh, it remains for us not to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in our minds that a property of angelic power is this, to assume to themselves bodily shape out of no material substance. How much more, you say, is it (within their competence to take a body) out of some material substance? That is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> enough. But there is no evidence of this, because <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says nothing. Then, again,  how should they who are able to form themselves into that which by nature they are not, be unable to do this out of no material substance? If they become that which they are not, why cannot they <em>so</em> become out of that which is not? But that which has not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> when it comes into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, is <em>made</em> out of nothing. This is why it is unnecessary either to inquire or to demonstrate what has subsequently become of their  bodies. What came out of nothing, came to nothing. They, who were able to convert <em>themselves</em> into flesh have it in their power to convert <em>nothing itself</em> into flesh. It is a greater thing to change a nature than to make matter. But even if it were necessary <em>to suppose</em> that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> derived their flesh from some material substance, it is surely more credible that it was from some earthly matter than from any kind of celestial substances, since it was composed of so palpably terrene a quality that it fed on earthly ailments. Suppose that even now a celestial <em>flesh</em>  had fed on earthly aliments, although it was not itself earthly, in the same way that earthly flesh actually fed on celestial aliments, although it had nothing of the celestial nature (for we read of manna having been food for the people: <q>Man,</q> says <em>the Psalmist</em>, <q>did eat <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels'</a> bread,</q> ) yet this does not once infringe the separate condition of the Lord's flesh, because of His different destination. For One who was to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, even unto death, it was necessary that He should be clothed with that flesh to which death belongs. Now that flesh to which death belongs is preceded by birth.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Explanation of the Lord's Question About His Mother and His Brethren. Answer to the Cavils of Apelles and Marcion, Who Support Their Denial of Christ's Nativity by It</h2>

<p>But whenever a dispute arises about the nativity, all who reject it as creating a presumption in favour of the reality of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flesh, wilfully deny that God Himself was born, on the ground that He asked, <q>Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?</q>  Let, therefore, <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a> hear what was our answer to <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> in that little work, in which we challenged his own (favourite) gospel to the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, even that the material circumstances of that remark (of the Lord's) should be considered.  First of all, nobody would have told Him that His mother and brethren were standing outside, if he were not certain both that He had a mother and brethren, and that they were the very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom he was then announcing&mdash;who had either been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him before, or were then and there discovered by him; although <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>  have removed this passage from the gospel, because those who were admiring His doctrine said that His supposed father, Joseph the carpenter, and His mother Mary, and His brethren, and His sisters, were very well known to them. But it was with the view of tempting Him, that they had mentioned to Him a mother and brethren which He did not possess. The <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says nothing of this, although it is not in other instances silent when anything was done against Him by way of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. <q>Behold,</q> it says, <q>a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037041"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;10:25</a></span> And in another passage: <q>The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> also came unto Him, tempting Him.</q> Who  was to prevent its being in this place also indicated that this was done with the view of tempting Him? I do not admit what you advance of your own apart from Scripture. Then there ought to be suggested  some occasion  for the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. What could they have thought to be in Him which required <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>? The question, to be sure, whether He had been born or not? For if this point were denied in His answer, it might come out on the announcement of a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. And yet no <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, when aiming at the discovery of the point which prompts the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> by its doubtfulness, falls upon one so abruptly, as not to be preceded by the question which compels the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> while raising the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Now, since the nativity of Christ had never come into question, how can you contend that they meant by their <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> to inquire about a point on which they had never raised a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>? Besides,  if He had to be tempted about His birth, this of course was not the proper way of doing it&mdash;by announcing those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who, even on the supposition of His birth, might possibly not have been in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. We have all been born, and yet all of us have not either brothers or mother. He might with more probability have had even a father than a mother, and uncles more likely than brothers. Thus is the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> about His birth unsuitable, for it might have been contrived without any mention of either His mother or His brethren. It is clearly more credible that, being certain that He had both a mother and brothers, they tested His divinity rather than His nativity, whether, when within, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what was without; being tried by the untrue announcement of the presence of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who were not present. But the artifice of a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> might have been thwarted thus: it might have happened that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that those whom they were announcing to be <q>standing without,</q> were in fact absent by the stress either of sickness, or of business, or a journey which He was at the time aware of. No one tempts (another) in a way in which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he may have himself to bear the shame of the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. There being, then, no suitable occasion for a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, the announcement that His mother and His brethren had actually turned up  recovers its naturalness. But there is some ground for thinking that <em>Christ's</em> answer denies His mother and brethren for the present, as even <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a> might learn. <q>The Lord's brethren had not yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037047"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;7:5</a></span> So is it contained in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which was published before <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> time; while there is at the same time a want of evidence of His mother's adherence to Him, although the Marthas and the other Marys were in constant attendance on Him. In this very passage indeed, their unbelief is evident. Jesus was teaching the way of life, preaching the kingdom of God <em>and</em> actively engaged in healing infirmities of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but all the while, while strangers were intent on Him, His very nearest <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> were absent. By and by they turn up, and keep outside; but they do not go in, because, forsooth, they set small store  on that which was doing within; nor do they even wait,  as if they had something which they could contribute more necessary than that which He was so earnestly doing; but they prefer to interrupt Him, and wish to call Him away from His great work. Now, I ask you, <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a>, or will you <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, please (to tell me), if you happened to be at a stage play, or had laid a wager  on a foot race or a chariot race, and were called away by such a message, would you not have exclaimed, <q>What are mother and brothers to me?</q>  And did not Christ, while preaching and manifesting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, fulfilling the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <em>and</em> scattering the darkness of the long preceding age, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> employ this same form of words, in order to strike the unbelief of those who stood outside, or to shake off the importunity of those who would call Him away from His work? If, however, He had meant to deny His own nativity, He would have found place, time, and means for expressing Himself very differently,  and not in words which might be uttered by one who had both a mother and brothers. When denying one's <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in indignation, one does not deny <em>their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a></em>, but censures <em>their faults</em>. Besides, He gave others the preference; and since He shows their title to this favour&mdash; even because they listened to the word (of God)&mdash; He points out in what sense He denied His mother and His brethren. For in whatever sense He adopted as His own those who adhered to Him, in that did He deny as His  those who kept aloof from Him. Christ also is wont to do to the utmost that which He enjoins on others. How strange, then, would it certainly  have been, if, while he was teaching others not to esteem mother, or father, or brothers, as highly as the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He were Himself to leave the word of God as soon as His mother and brethren were announced to Him! He denied His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, then, in the sense in which He has taught us to deny ours&mdash; for God's work. But there is also another view of the case: in the abjured mother there is a figure of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, as well as of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the unbelieving brethren. In their person <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> remained outside, while the new <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who kept close to Christ within, hearing and believing, represented the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which He called mother in a preferable sense and a worthier brotherhood, with the repudiation of the carnal relationship. It was in just the same sense, indeed, that He also replied to that exclamation (of a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>), not denying His mother's <q>womb and paps,</q> but designating those as more <q>blessed who hear the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>

<p>These passages alone, in which <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a> and <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> seem to place their chief reliance when interpreted according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the entire uncorrupted gospel, ought to have been sufficient for proving the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh of Christ by a defence of His birth. But since <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles'</a> precious set  lay a very great stress on the shameful condition  of the flesh, which they will have to have been furnished with <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> tampered with by the fiery author of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,  and so unworthy of Christ; and because they on that account suppose that a sidereal substance is suitable for Him, I am bound to refute them on their own ground. They mention a certain <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of great renown as having created this world of ours, and as having, after the creation, repented of his work. This indeed we have treated of in a passage by itself; for we have written a little work in opposition to them, <em>on the question</em> whether one who had the spirit, and will, and power of Christ for such operations, could have done anything which required repentance, since they describe the <em>said</em> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> by the figure of <q>the lost sheep.</q> The world, then, must be a wrong thing,  according to the evidence of its Creator's repentance; for all repentance is the admission of fault, nor has it indeed any <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> except through fault. Now, if the world  is a fault, as is the body, such must be its parts&mdash; faulty too; so in like manner must be the heaven and its celestial (contents), and everything which is conceived and produced out of it. And <q>a corrupt tree must needs bring forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037061"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;7:17</a></span> The flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, therefore, if composed of celestial elements, consists of faulty materials, sinful by reason of its sinful origin;  so that it must be a part of that substance which they disdain to clothe Christ with, because of its sinfulness,&mdash; in other words, our own. Then, as there is no difference in the point of ignominy, let them either devise for Christ some substance of a purer stamp, since they are displeased with our own, or else let them recognise this too, than which even a heavenly substance could not have been better. We read in so many words:  <q>The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037064"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse47">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:47</a></span> This passage, however, has nothing to do with any difference of substance; it only contrasts with the once  <q>earthy</q> substance of the flesh of the first man, Adam, the <q>heavenly</q> substance of the spirit of the second man, Christ. And so entirely does the passage refer the celestial man to the spirit and not to the flesh, that those whom it compares to Him evidently become celestial&mdash; by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, of course&mdash; even in this <q>earthy flesh.</q> Now, since Christ is heavenly even in regard to the flesh, they could not be compared to Him, who are not heavenly in reference to their flesh.  If, then, they who become heavenly, as Christ also was, carry about an <q>earthy</q> substance of flesh, the conclusion which is affirmed by this fact is, that Christ Himself also was heavenly, but in an <q>earthy</q> flesh, even as they are who are put on a level with Him. </p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Christ's Flesh Perfectly Natural, Like Our Own. None of the Supernatural Features Which the Heretics Ascribed to It Discoverable, on a Careful View</h2>

<p>We have thus far gone on the principle, that nothing which is derived from some other thing, however different it may be from that from which it is derived, is so different as not to suggest the source from which it comes. No material substance is without the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of its own original, however great a change into new properties it may have undergone. There is this very body of ours, the formation of which out of the dust of the ground is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which has found its way into Gentile fables; it certainly testifies its own origin from the two elements of earth and water&mdash;from the former by its flesh, from the latter by its blood. Now, although there is a difference in the appearance of qualities (in other words, that which proceeds from something else is in development  different), yet, after all, what is blood but red fluid? What is flesh but earth in a special  form? Consider the respective qualities,&mdash; of the muscles as clods; of the bones as stones; the mammillary glands as a kind of pebbles. Look upon the close junctions of the nerves as propagations of roots, and the branching courses of the veins as winding rivulets, and the down (which covers us) as moss, and the hair as grass, and the very treasures of marrow within our bones as ores  of flesh. All these marks of the earthy origin were in Christ; and it is they which obscured Him as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, for He was looked on as man, for no other reason whatever than because He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the corporeal substance of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Or else, show us some celestial substance in Him purloined from the Bear, and the Pleiades, and the Hyades. Well, then, <em>the characteristics</em> which we have enumerated are so many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> that His was an earthy flesh, as ours is; but anything new or anything strange I do not discover. Indeed it was from His words and actions only, from His teaching and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> solely, that men, though amazed, owned Christ to be man.  But if there had been in Him any new kind of flesh miraculously obtained (from the stars), it would have been certainly well known.  As the case stood, however, it was actually the ordinary  condition of His terrene flesh which made all things else about Him wonderful, as when they said, <q>Whence has this man this wisdom and these mighty works?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037074"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse54">Matthew&nbsp;13:54</a></span> Thus spoke even they who despised His outward form. His body did not reach even to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beauty, to say nothing of heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.  Had the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> given us no information whatever concerning His ignoble appearance, His very sufferings and the very contumely He endured bespeak it all. The sufferings attested His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, the contumely <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> its abject condition. Would any man have dared to touch even with his little finger, the body <em>of Christ</em>, if it had been of an unusual nature;  or to smear His face with spitting, if it had not invited it  (by its abjectness)? Why talk of a heavenly flesh, when you have no grounds to offer us for your celestial theory?  Why deny it to be earthy, when you have the best of reasons for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it to be earthy? He hungered under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> <em><a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a></em>; He thirsted with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>; He wept over Lazarus; He trembles at death (for <q>the flesh,</q> as He says, <q>is weak</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037079"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;26:41</a></span>); at last, He pours out His blood. These, I suppose, are celestial marks? But how, I ask, could He have incurred contempt and suffering in the way I have described, if there had beamed forth in that flesh of His anything of celestial excellence? From this, therefore, we have a convincing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that in it there was nothing of heaven, because it must be capable of contempt and suffering.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Another Class of Heretics Refuted. They Alleged that Christ's Flesh Was of a Finer Texture, Animalis, Composed of Soul</h2>

<p>I now turn to another class, who are equally wise in their own conceit. They affirm that the flesh of Christ is composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,  that His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> became flesh, so that His flesh is <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and as His flesh is of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so is His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of flesh. But here, again, I must have some reasons. If, in order to save the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, Christ took a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> within Himself, because it could not be saved except by Him having it within Himself, I see no reason why, in clothing Himself with flesh, He should have made that flesh one of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,  as if He could not have saved the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in any other way than by making flesh of it. For while He saves <em>our</em> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which are not only not of flesh,  but are even distinct from flesh, how much more able was He to secure <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which He took Himself, when it was also not of flesh? Again, since they assume it as a main tenet,  that Christ came forth not to deliver the flesh, but only our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, how absurd it is, in the first place, that, meaning to save only the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, He yet made it into just that sort of bodily substance which He had no intention of saving! And, secondly, if He had undertaken to deliver our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by means of that which He carried, He ought, in that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which He carried to have carried our <em><a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></em>, one (that is) of the same condition as ours; and whatever is the condition of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in its secret nature, it is certainly not one of flesh. However, it was not our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which He saved, if His own was of flesh; for ours is not of flesh. Now, if He did not save our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on the ground, that it was a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of flesh which He saved, He is nothing to us, because He has not saved our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Nor indeed did it need <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, for it was not our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> really, since it was, on the supposition,  a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of flesh. But yet it is evident that it has been saved. Of flesh, therefore, it was not composed, and it was ours; for it was our <em><a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></em> that was saved, since that was in peril <em>of damnation</em>. We therefore now conclude that as in Christ the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not of flesh, so neither could His flesh have possibly been composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. The Opposite Extravagance Exposed. That is Christ with a Soul Composed of Flesh&mdash; Corporeal, Though Invisible. Christ's Soul, Like Ours, Distinct from Flesh, Though Clothed in It</h2>

<p>But we meet another argument of theirs, when we raise the question why Christ, in assuming a flesh composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, should seem to have had a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that was made of flesh? For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they say, desired to make the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> visible to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, by enduing it with a bodily nature, although it was before invisible; of its own nature, indeed, it was incapable of seeing anything, even its own self, by reason of the obstacle of this flesh, so that it was even a matter of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether it was born or not. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, therefore (they further say), was made corporeal in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in order that we might see it when undergoing birth, and death, and (what is more) resurrection. But yet, how was this possible, that by means of the flesh the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should demonstrate itself  to itself or to us, when it could not possibly be ascertained that it would offer this mode of exhibiting itself by the flesh, until the thing came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to which it was unknown,  that is to say, the flesh? It received darkness, forsooth, in order to be able to shine! Now,  let us first turn our attention to this point, whether it was requisite that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should exhibit itself in the manner contended for;  and next <em>consider</em> whether their previous position be  that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is wholly invisible (inquiring further) whether this invisibility is the result of its incorporeality, or whether it actually possesses some sort of body peculiar to itself. And yet, although they say that it is invisible, they determine it to be corporeal, but having somewhat that is invisible. For if it has nothing invisible how can it be said to be invisible? But even its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is an impossibility, unless it has that which is instrumental to its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.  Since, however, it exists, it must needs have a something through which it exists. If it has this something, it must be its body. Everything which exists is a bodily <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> <em>sui generis</em>. Nothing lacks bodily <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> but that which is non-existent. If, then, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has an invisible body, He who had proposed to make it  visible would certainly have done His work better  if He had made that part of it which was accounted invisible, visible; because then there would have been no untruth or weakness in the case, and neither of these flaws is suitable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. (But as the case stands in the hypothesis) there is <em>untruth</em>, since He has set forth the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as being a different thing from what it really is; and there is <em>weakness</em>, since He was unable to make it appear  to be that which it is. No one who wishes to exhibit a man covers him with a veil  or a mask. This, however, is precisely what has been done to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, if it has been clothed with a covering belonging to something else, by being converted into flesh. But even if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is, on their hypothesis, supposed  to be incorporeal, so that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whatever it is, should by some <em><a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a></em> force of the reason  be quite unknown, only not be a body, then in that case it were not beyond the power of God&mdash; indeed it would be more consistent with His plan&mdash; if He displayed  the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in some new sort of body, different from that which we all have in common, one of which we should have quite a different notion,  (being spared the idea that)  He had set His mind on  making, without an adequate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, a visible <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> instead of  an invisible one&mdash; a fit incentive, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, for such questions as they start,  by their maintenance of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh for it.  Christ, however, could not have appeared among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> except as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Restore, therefore, to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; <em><a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a></em> that He who willed to walk the earth as a man exhibited even a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a thoroughly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> condition, not making it of flesh, but clothing it with flesh.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. The True Functions of the Soul. Christ Assumed It in His Perfect Human Nature, Not to Reveal and Explain It, But to Save It. Its Resurrection with the Body Assured by Christ</h2>

<p>Well, now, let it be granted that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is made apparent by the flesh,  on the assumption that it was evidently necessary  that it should be made apparent in some way or other, that is, as being incognizable to itself and to us: there is still an absurd distinction in this <em>hypothesis</em>, which implies that we are ourselves separate from our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when all that we are is <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Indeed,  without the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> we are nothing; there is not even the name of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, only that of a carcass. If, then, we are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it is in fact the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of itself. Thus the only remaining question left for us to look into is, whether the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was in this matter so <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of itself that it became <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in any way it could.  The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in my opinion,  is sensual.  Nothing, therefore, pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is unconnected with sense,  nothing pertaining to sense is unconnected with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.  And if I may use the expression for the sake of emphasis, I would say, <q> <em>Anim&oelig; anima sensus est</em></q>&mdash; <q>Sense is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> very <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> Now, since it is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that imparts the faculty of perception  to all (that have sense), and since it is itself that perceives the very senses, not to say properties, of them all, how is it likely that it did not itself receive sense as its own natural constitution? Whence is it to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is necessary for itself under given circumstances, from the very necessity of natural causes, if it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not its own property, and what is necessary for it? To recognise this indeed is within the competence of every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; it has, I mean, a practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of itself, without which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of itself no <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could possibly have exercised its own functions.  I suppose, too, that it is especially suitable that man, the only rational animal, should have been furnished with such a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as would make him the rational animal, itself being pre-eminently rational. Now, how can that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which makes man a rational animal be itself rational if it be itself <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of its rationality, being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of its own very self? So far, however, is it from being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, that it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> its own Author, its own Master, and its own condition. Before it learns anything about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it names the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Before it acquires any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His judgment, it professes to commend itself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. There is nothing one oftener hears of than that there is no hope after death; and yet what imprecations or deprecations does not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> use according as the man dies after a well or ill spent life! These reflections are more fully pursued in a short treatise which we have written, <q> <em>On the Testimony of the Soul</em>.</q>  Besides, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of itself from the beginning, there is nothing it could  have learned of Christ except its own quality.  It was not its own form that it learned of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but its <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> did the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> descend and take on Him a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> might discover itself in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but Christ in itself. For its <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is endangered, not by its being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of itself, but of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>The life,</q> says He, <q>was manifested,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037117"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:2</a></span> not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And again, <q>I have come to save the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> He did not say, <q>to explain</q>  it. We could not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, of course,  that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, although an invisible <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, is born and dies, unless it were exhibited corporeally. We certainly were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that it was to rise again with the flesh. This is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which it will be found was manifested by Christ. But even this He did not manifest in Himself in a different way than in some Lazarus, whose flesh was no more composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>  than his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was of flesh.  What further <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, therefore, have we received of the structure  of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which we were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of before? What invisible part was there belonging to it which wanted to be made visible by the flesh?</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Christ's Human Nature. The Flesh and the Soul Both Fully and Unconfusedly Contained in It</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> became flesh that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> might become visible.  Well, then, did the flesh likewise become <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that the flesh might be manifested?  If the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is flesh, it is no longer <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but flesh. If the flesh is <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it is no longer flesh, but <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Where, then, there is flesh, and where there is <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it has become both one and the other.  Now, if they are neither in particular, although they become both one and the other, it is, to say the least, very absurd, that we should understand the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> when we name the flesh, and when we indicate the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, explain ourselves as meaning the flesh. All things will be in danger of being taken in a sense different from their own proper sense, and, while taken in that different sense, of losing their proper one, if they are called by a name which differs from their natural designation. Fidelity in names secures the safe appreciation of properties. When these properties undergo a change, they are considered to possess such qualities as their names indicate. Baked clay, for instance, receives the name of brick.  It retains not the name which designated its former state,  because it has no longer a share in that state. Therefore, also, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Christ having become flesh,  cannot be anything else than that which it has become nor can it be any longer that which it once was, having become indeed  something else. And since we have just had recourse to an illustration, we will put it to further use. Our pitcher, then, which was formed of the clay, is one body, and has one name indicative, of course, of that one body; nor can the pitcher be also called clay, because what it once was, it is no longer. Now that which is no longer (what it was) is also not an inseparable property.  And the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not an inseparable property. Since, therefore, it has become flesh, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a uniform solid body; it is also a wholly incomplex being,  and an indivisible substance. But in Christ we find the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the flesh expressed in simple unfigurative  terms; that is to say, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is called <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the flesh, flesh; nowhere is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> termed flesh, or the flesh, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and yet they ought to have been thus (confusedly) named if such had been their condition. <em>The fact, however, is</em> that even by <em>Christ</em> Himself each substance has been separately mentioned by itself, conformably of course, to the distinction which exists between the properties of both, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by itself, and the flesh by itself. <q> <em>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></em>,</q> says He, <q>is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death;</q>  and <q>the bread that I will give is <em>my flesh</em>, (which I will give) for the life  of the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037135"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse51">John&nbsp;6:51</a></span> Now, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had been flesh, there would have only been in Christ the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> composed of flesh, or else the flesh composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.  Since, however, He keeps the species distinct, the flesh and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, He shows them to be two. If two, then they are no longer one; if not one, then the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not composed of flesh, nor the flesh of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the soul-flesh, or the flesh-<a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is but one; unless indeed He even had some other <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> apart from that which was flesh, and bare about another flesh besides that which was <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But since He had but one flesh and one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash;that <q><a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which was sorrowful, even unto death,</q> and that <em>flesh which was the</em> <q>bread given for the life of the world,</q>&mdash; the number is unimpaired  of two substances distinct in kind, thus excluding the unique species of the flesh-comprised <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Christ Took Not on Him an Angelic Nature, But the Human. It Was Men, Not Angels, Whom He Came to Save</h2>

<p>But Christ, they say, bare  (the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of) an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. For what reason? The same which induced Him to become man? Christ, then, was actuated by the motive which led Him to take <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was the motive, the restoration of that which had perished. Man had perished; his recovery had become necessary. No such <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, however, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> for Christ's taking on Him the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For although there is assigned to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> also perdition in <q>the fire prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037139"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> yet a restoration is never promised to them. No charge about the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> did Christ ever receive from the Father; and that which the Father neither promised nor commanded, Christ could not have undertaken. For what object, therefore, did He bear the angelic nature, if it were not (that He might have it) as a powerful helper  wherewithal to execute the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of man? The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, in truth, was not competent alone to deliver man, whom a solitary and single serpent had overthrown! There is, then, no longer but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but one Saviour, if there be two to contrive <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and one of them in need of the other. But was it His object indeed to deliver man by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>? Why, then, come down to do that which He was about to expedite with an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> help? If by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> aid, why <em>come</em> Himself also? If He meant to do all by Himself, why have an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> too? He has been, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, called <q>the Angel of great counsel,</q> that is, a messenger, by a term expressive of official function, not of nature. For He had to announce to the world the mighty purpose of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, even that which ordained the restoration of man. But He is not on this account to be regarded as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, as a Gabriel or a Michael. For the Lord of the Vineyard sends even His Son to the labourers to require fruit, as well as His servants. Yet the Son will not therefore be counted as one of the servants because He undertook the office of a servant. I may, then, more easily say, if such an expression is to be hazarded,  that the Son is actually an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, that is, a messenger, from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, than that there is an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in the Son. Forasmuch, however, as it has been declared concerning the Son Himself, <q>You have made Him a little lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a></q>  how will it appear that He put on the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> if He was made lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, having become man, with flesh and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>? As <q>the Spirit  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> however, and <q>the Power of the Highest,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037144"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;1:35</a></span> can He be regarded as lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>&mdash;He who is verily <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? Well, but as bearing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, He is so far made inferior to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; but as bearing angelic nature, He to the same degree loses that inferiority. This opinion will be very suitable for Ebion,  who holds Jesus to be a mere man, and nothing more than a descendant of David, and not also the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; although He is, to be sure,  in one respect more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> than the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, inasmuch as he declares that there was an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in Him, just as there was in Zechariah. Only it was never said by Christ, <q>And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, which spoke within me, said unto me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037147"><a href="../bible/zec001.htm#verse14">Zechariah&nbsp;1:14</a></span> Neither, indeed, was ever used by Christ that familiar phrase of all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <q>Thus says the Lord.</q> For He was Himself the Lord, who openly spoke by His own authority, prefacing His words with the formula, <q>Verily, verily, <em>I</em> say unto you.</q> What need is there of further argument? Hear what Isaiah says in emphatic words, <q>It was no <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, nor deputy, but the Lord Himself who saved them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037148"><a href="../bible/isa063.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;63:9</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 15. The Valentinian Figment of Christ's Flesh Being of a Spiritual Nature, Examined and Refuted Out of Scripture</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, indeed, on the strength of his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> system, might consistently devise a spiritual flesh for Christ. Any one who refused to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that that flesh was <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> might pretend it to be anything he liked, forasmuch as (and this remark is applicable to all <em><a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a></em>), if it was not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and was not born of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, I do not see of what substance Christ Himself spoke when He called Himself man and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, <em>saying</em>: <q>But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037149"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse40">John&nbsp;8:40</a></span> and <q>The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is Lord of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037150"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;12:8</a></span> For it is of Him that Isaiah writes: <q>A man of suffering, and acquainted with the bearing of weakness;</q>  and Jeremiah: <q>He is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him?</q>  and Daniel: <q>Upon the clouds (He came) as the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037153"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse13">Daniel&nbsp;7:13</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> likewise says: <q>The man Christ Jesus is the one Mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037154"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> Also Peter, in the Acts of the Apostles, speaks of Him as verily <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> (when he says), <q><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was a man approved of God among you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037155"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse22">Acts&nbsp;2:22</a></span> These passages alone ought to suffice as a prescriptive  testimony in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that Christ had <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh derived from man, and not spiritual, and that His flesh was not composed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,  nor of stellar substance, and that it was not an imaginary flesh; (and no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> they would be sufficient) if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> could only divest themselves of all their contentious warmth and artifice. For, as I have read in some writer of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus'</a> wretched faction,  they refuse at the outset to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and earthly substance was created  for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, lest the Lord should be regarded as inferior to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are not formed of earthly flesh; whence, too, it would be necessary that, if His flesh were like ours, it should be similarly born, not of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, nor of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of man. Why, moreover, should it be born, not of corruptible [seed], but of incorruptible? Why, again, since His flesh has both risen and returned to heaven, is not ours, being like His, also taken up at once? Or else, why does not His flesh, since it is like ours, return in like manner to the ground, and suffer dissolution? Such objections even the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> used constantly to bandy about.  Was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> reduced to such a depth of degradation? Again, if He rose again as a precedent for our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, how is it that nothing like it has been thought desirable (to happen) to ourselves?  Such views are not improper for <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> and they are fit and natural for the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> too. For, indeed, what difference is there between them, except it be that the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, in not believing, do <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, in believing, do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? Then, again, they read: <q>You made Him a little less than <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>;</q>  and they deny the lower nature of that Christ who declares Himself to be, <q>not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but a worm;</q>  who also had <q>no form nor comeliness, but His form was ignoble, despised more than all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, a man in suffering, and acquainted with the bearing of weakness.</q>  Here they discover a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being mingled with a divine one and so they deny the manhood. They <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He died, and maintain that a being which has died was born of an incorruptible substance;  as if, forsooth, corruptibility  were something else than death! But our flesh, too, ought immediately to have risen again. Wait a while. Christ has not yet subdued His enemies, so as to be able to triumph over them in company with His friends.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. Christ's Flesh in Nature, the Same as Ours, Only Sinless. The Difference Between Carnem Peccati and Peccatum Carnis: It is the Latter Which Christ Abolished. The Flesh of the First Adam, No Less Than that of the Second Adam, Not Received from Human Seed, Although as Entirely Human as Our Own, Which is Derived from It</h2>

<p>The famous Alexander,  too, instigated by his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of disputation in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fashion of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> temper, has made himself conspicuous against us; he will have us say that Christ put on flesh of an earthly origin,  in order that He might in His own person abolish sinful flesh.  Now, even if we did assert this as our opinion, we should be able to defend it in such a way as completely to avoid the extravagant folly which he ascribes to us in making us suppose that the very flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in Himself abolished as being sinful; because we mention our belief (in public),  that it is sitting at the right hand of the Father in heaven; and we further declare that it will come again from thence in all the pomp  of the Father's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: it is therefore just as impossible for us to say that it is abolished, as it is for us to maintain that it is sinful, and so made void, since in it there has been no fault. We maintain, moreover, that what has been abolished in Christ is not <em>carnem peccati</em>, <q>sinful flesh,</q> but <em>peccatum carnis</em>, <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh,</q>&mdash; not the material thing, but its condition;  not the substance, but its flaw;  and (this we aver) on the authority of the apostle, who says, <q>He abolished <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh.</q>  Now in another sentence he says that Christ was <q>in the likeness of sinful flesh,</q>  not, however, as if He had taken on Him <q>the likeness of the flesh,</q> in the sense of a semblance of body instead of its reality; but he means us to understand likeness to the flesh which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>,  because the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which committed no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself, resembled that which had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>&mdash;resembled it in its nature, but not in the corruption it received from Adam; whence we also affirm that there was in Christ the same flesh as that whose nature in man is sinful. In the flesh, therefore, <em>we say</em> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been abolished, because in Christ that same flesh is maintained without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which in man was not maintained without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now, it would not contribute to the purpose of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> abolishing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh, if He did not abolish it in that flesh in which was the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor (would it conduce) to His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For surely it would have been no strange thing if He had removed the stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in some better flesh, and one which should possess a different, even a sinless, nature! Then, you say, if He took our flesh, Christ's was a sinful one. Do not, however, fetter with <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> a sense which is quite intelligible. For in putting on our flesh, He made it His own; in making it His own, He made it sinless. A word of caution, however, must be addressed to all who refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that our flesh was in Christ on the ground that it came not of the seed of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> father,  let them remember that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> himself received this flesh of ours without the seed of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> father. As earth was converted into this flesh of ours without the seed of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> father, so also was it quite possible for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to take to Himself  the substance of the selfsame flesh, without a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> father's agency. </p>

<h2>Chapter 17. The Similarity of Circumstances Between the First and the Second Adam, as to the Derivation of Their Flesh. An Analogy Also Pleasantly Traced Between Eve and the Virgin Mary</h2>

<p>But, leaving Alexander with his syllogisms, which he so perversely applies in his discussions, as well as with the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, which, with consummate assurance, he interpolates as the production of some respectable  author, let us confine our inquiry to a single point&mdash; Whether Christ received flesh from the virgin?&mdash; that we may thus arrive at a certain <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that His flesh was <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, if He derived its substance from His mother's womb, although we are at once furnished with clear evidences of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> character of His flesh, from its name and description as that of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its constitution, and from the system of its sensations, and from its suffering of death. Now, it will first be necessary to show what previous reason there was for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God's</a> being born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. He who was going to consecrate a new order of birth, must Himself be born after a novel fashion, concerning which Isaiah foretold how that the Lord Himself would give the sign. What, then, is the sign? <q>Behold a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive and bear a son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037181"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;7:14</a></span> Accordingly, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> did conceive and bear <q><a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, God with us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037182"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;1:23</a></span> This is the new nativity; a man is born in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And in this man God was born, taking the flesh of an ancient race, without the help, however, of the ancient seed, in order that He might reform it with a new seed, that is, in a spiritual manner, and cleanse it by the re-moval of all its ancient stains. But the whole of this new birth was prefigured, as was the case in all other instances, in ancient type, the Lord being born as man by a dispensation in which a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> was the medium. The earth was still in a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> state, reduced as yet by no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> labour, with no seed as yet cast into its furrows, when, as we are told, God made man out of it into a living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note037183"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;2:7</a></span> As, then, the first <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is thus introduced to us, it is a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> inference that the second <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> likewise, as the apostle has told us, was formed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> into a quickening spirit out of the ground&mdash;in other words, out of a flesh which was unstained as yet by any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generation. But that I may lose no opportunity of supporting my argument from the name of Adam, why is Christ called <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> by the apostle, unless it be that, as man, He was of that earthly origin? And even reason here maintains the same conclusion, because it was by just the contrary  operation that God recovered His own image and likeness, of which He had been <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For it was while Eve was yet a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, that the ensnaring word had crept into her ear which was to build the edifice of death. Into a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in like manner, must be introduced that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> which was to raise the fabric of life; so that what had been reduced to ruin by this sex, might by the selfsame sex be recovered to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. As Eve had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the serpent, so Mary <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>.  The delinquency which the one occasioned by believing, the other by believing effaced. But (it will be said) Eve did not at the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> word conceive in her womb. Well, she at all events conceived; for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> word afterwards became as seed to her that she should conceive as an outcast, and bring forth in sorrow. Indeed she gave birth to a fratricidal <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; while Mary, on the contrary, bare one who was one day to secure <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, His own brother after the flesh, and the murderer of Himself. God therefore sent down into the virgin's womb His Word, as the good Brother, who should blot out the memory of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> brother. Hence it was necessary that Christ should come forth for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in that condition <em>of flesh</em> into which man had entered ever since his condemnation.</p>

<p>Now, that we may give a simpler answer, it was not fit that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> should be born of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> father's seed, lest, if He were wholly the Son of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He should fail to be also the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and have nothing more than <q>a Solomon</q> or <q>a Jonas,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037186"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;12:41-42</a></span> &mdash; as Ebion  thought we ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> concerning Him. In order, therefore, that He who was already the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>&mdash; of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father's seed, that is to say, the Spirit&mdash; might also be the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, He only wanted to assume flesh, of the flesh of man  without the seed of a man;  for the seed of a man was unnecessary  for One who had the seed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As, then, before His birth of the virgin, He was able to have God for His Father without a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mother, so likewise, after He was born of the virgin, He was able to have a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> for His mother without a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> father. He is thus man with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in short, since He is man's flesh with God's Spirit &mdash; <em>flesh</em> (I say) without seed from man, <em>Spirit</em> with seed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For as much, then, as the dispensation of <em>God's</em> purpose  concerning His Son required that He should be born  of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, why should He not have received of the virgin the body which He bore from the virgin? Because, (forsooth) it is something else which He took from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for <q>the Word</q> say they, <q>was made flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037194"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> Now this very statement plainly shows what it was that was made flesh; nor can it possibly be that  anything else than the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>. Now, whether it was of the flesh that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, or whether it was so made of the (divine) seed itself, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> must tell us. As, however, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> is silent about everything except what it was that was made (flesh), and says nothing of that from which it was so made, it must be held to suggest that from something else, and not from itself, was the Word made flesh. And if not from itself, but from something else, from what can we more suitably suppose that the Word became flesh than from that flesh in which it submitted to the dispensation?  And (we have a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the same conclusion in the fact) that the Lord Himself sententiously and distinctly pronounced, <q>that which is born of the flesh is flesh,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037197"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;3:6</a></span> even because it is born of the flesh. But if He here spoke of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being simply, and not of Himself, (as you maintain) then you must deny absolutely that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is man, and must maintain that <em><a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a></em> was not suitable to Him. And then He adds, <q>That which is born of the Spirit is spirit,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037198"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;3:6</a></span> because God is a Spirit, and He was born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now this description is certainly even more applicable to Him than it is to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. But if this passage indeed apply to Him, then why does not the preceding one also? For you cannot divide their relation, and adapt this to Him, and the previous clause to all other men, especially as you do not deny that Christ possesses the two substances, both of the flesh and of the Spirit. Besides, as He was in possession both of flesh and of Spirit, He cannot possibly, when speaking of the condition of the two substances which He Himself bears, be supposed to have determined that the Spirit indeed was His own, but that the flesh was not His own. Forasmuch, therefore, as He is of the Spirit He is God the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; just as He is also born of the flesh of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, being generated in the flesh as man. </p>

<h2>Chapter 19. Christ, as to His Divine Nature, as the Word of God, Became Flesh, Not by Carnal Conception, Nor by the Will of the Flesh and of Man, But by the Will of God. Christ's Divine Nature, of Its Own Accord, Descended into the Virgin's Womb</h2>

<p>What, then, is the meaning of this passage, <q>Born  not of blood, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but of God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037201"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;1:13</a></span> I shall make more use of this passage after I have confuted those who have tampered with it. They maintain that it was written thus (in the plural)  <q> <em>Who were born</em>, not of blood, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> as if designating those who were before mentioned as <q>believing in His name,</q> in order to point out the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of that <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> seed of the elect and spiritual which they appropriate to themselves.  But how can this be, when all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the name of the Lord are, by reason of the common principle of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, born of blood, and of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, and of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as indeed is <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> himself? The expression is in the singular number, as referring to the Lord, <q>He was born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And very properly, because Christ is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and with the Word the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and by the Spirit the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and whatsoever else appertains to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As flesh, however, He is not of blood, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, nor of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because it was by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of God that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>. To the flesh, indeed, and not to the Word, accrues the denial of the nativity which is natural to us all as men,  because it was as flesh that He had thus to be born, and not as the Word. Now, while the passage actually denies that He was born of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, how is it that it did not also deny (that He was born) of the substance of the flesh? For it did not disavow the substance of the flesh when it denied His being <q>born of blood</q> but only the matter of the seed, which, as all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, is the warm blood as convected by ebullition  into the <em>coagulum</em> of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> blood. In the cheese, it is from the coagulation that the milky substance acquires that consistency,  which is condensed by infusing the rennet.  We thus understand that what is denied is the Lord's birth after sexual intercourse (as is suggested by the phrase, <q>the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of man and of the flesh</q>), not <em>His nativity</em> from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> womb. Why, too, is it insisted on with such an accumulation of emphasis that He was not born of blood, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, nor (of the will) of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if it were not that His flesh was such that no man could have any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on the point of its being born from sexual intercourse? Again, although denying His birth from such cohabitation, the passage did not deny that He was born of <em>real</em> flesh; it rather affirmed this, by the very fact that it did not deny His birth in the flesh in the same way that it denied His birth from sexual intercourse. Pray, tell me, why the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>  descended into a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> womb at all, if He did not do so for the purpose of partaking of flesh from the womb. For He could have become <em>spiritual</em> flesh  without such a process&mdash;much more simply, indeed, without the womb than in it. He had no reason for enclosing Himself within one, if He was to bear forth nothing from it. Not without reason, however, did He descend into a womb. Therefore He received (flesh) therefrom; else, if He received nothing therefrom, His descent into it would have been without a reason, especially if He meant to become flesh of that sort which was not derived from a womb, that is to say, a spiritual one. </p>

<h2>Chapter 20. Christ Born of a Virgin, of Her Substance. The Physiological Facts of His Real and Exact Birth of a Human Mother, as Suggested by Certain Passages of Scripture</h2>

<p>But to what shifts you resort, in your attempt to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">rob</a> the syllable <em>ex</em> (<em>of</em>)  of its proper force as a preposition, and to substitute another for it in a sense not found throughout the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>! You say that He was born <em>through</em>  a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, not <em>of</em>  a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and <em>in</em> a womb, not <em>of</em> a womb, because the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in the dream said to Joseph, <q>That which is born in her</q> (not of her) <q>is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037214"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;1:20</a></span> But the fact is, if he had meant <q>of her,</q> he must have said <q>in her;</q> for that which was of her, was also in her. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> expression, therefore, <q>in her,</q> has precisely the same meaning as the phrase <q>of her.</q> It is, however, a fortunate circumstance that Matthew also, when tracing down the Lord's descent from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to Mary, says, <q>Jacob begot Joseph the husband of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, <em>of whom</em> was born Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037215"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;1:16</a></span> But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, too, silences these critics  when he says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent forth His Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037217"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;4:4</a></span> Does he mean <em>through</em> a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, or <em>in</em> a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? Nay more, for the sake of greater emphasis, he uses the word <q> <em>made</em></q> rather than <em>born</em>, although the use of the latter expression would have been simpler. But by saying <q> <em>made</em>,</q> he not only confirmed the statement, <q>The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037218"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> but he also asserted the reality of the flesh which was made of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. We shall have also the support of the Psalms on this point, not the <q>Psalms</q> indeed of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a>, but the Psalms of David, the most illustrious saint and well-known <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. He sings to us of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and through his voice Christ indeed also sang concerning Himself. Hear, then, Christ the Lord speaking to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father: <q>You are He that drew  me out of my mother's womb.</q>  Here is the first point. <q>You are my hope from my mother's breasts; upon You have I been cast from the womb.</q>  Here is another point. <q>You are my God from my mother's belly.</q>  Here is a third point. Now let us carefully attend to the sense of these passages. <q>You drew me,</q> He says, <q>out of the womb.</q> Now what is it which is <em>drawn</em>, if it be not that which adheres, that which is firmly fastened to anything from which it is drawn in order to be sundered? If He clove not to the womb, how could He have been drawn from it? If He who clove thereto was drawn from it, how could He have adhered to it, if it were not that, all the while He was in the womb, He was tied to it, as to His origin,  by the umbilical cord, which communicated growth to Him from the matrix? Even when one strange matter amalgamates with another, it becomes so entirely incorporated  with that with which it amalgamates, that when it is drawn off from it, it carries with it some part of the body from which it is torn, as if in consequence of the severance of the union and growth which the constituent pieces had communicated to each other. But what were His <q>mother's breasts</q> which He mentions? No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> they were those which He sucked. Midwives, and doctors, and naturalists, can tell us, from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> breasts, whether they usually flow at any other time than when the womb is affected with pregnancy, when the veins convey therefrom the blood of the lower parts  to the <em>mamilla</em>, and in the act of transference convert the secretion into the nutritious  substance of milk. Whence it comes to pass that during the period of lactation the monthly issues are suspended. But if the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a> of Himself without any communication with a womb, no mother's womb operating upon Him with its usual function and support, how could the lacteal fountain have been conveyed (from the womb) to the breasts, since (the womb) can only effect the change by actual possession <em>of the proper substance</em>? But it could not possibly have had blood for transformation into milk, unless it possessed the causes of blood also, that is to say, the severance (by birth)  of its own flesh <em>from the mother's womb</em>. Now it is easy to see what was the novelty of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> being born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. It was simply this, that (He was born) of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in the real manner which we have indicated, in order that our regeneration might have virginal purity&mdash;spiritually cleansed from all pollutions through Christ, who was Himself a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, even in the flesh, in that He was <em>born</em> of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin's</a> flesh.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21. The Word of God Did Not Become Flesh Except in the Virgin's Womb and of Her Substance. Through His Mother He is Descended from Her Great Ancestor David. He is Described Both in the Old and in the New Testament as <q>The Fruit of David's Loins.</q></h2>

<p>Whereas, then, they contend that the novelty (of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth) consisted in this, that as the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> became flesh without the seed of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> father, so there should be no flesh of the virgin mother (assisting in the transaction), why should not the novelty rather be confined to this, that His flesh, although not born of seed, should yet have proceeded from flesh? I should like to go more closely into this discussion. <q>Behold,</q> says he, <q>a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive in the womb.</q>  <em>Conceive</em> what? I ask. The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, of course, and not the seed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and in order, certainly, to bring forth a son. <q>For,</q> says he, <q>she shall bring forth a son.</q>  Therefore, as the act of conception was her own,  so also what she brought forth was her own, also, although the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of conception  was not. If, on the other hand, the Word became flesh of Himself, then He both conceived and brought forth Himself, and the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is stultified. For in that case a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> did <em>not</em> conceive, and did <em>not</em> bring forth; since whatever she brought forth from the conception of the Word, is not her own flesh. But is this the only statement of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> which will be frustrated?  Will not the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> announcement also be subverted, that the virgin should <q>conceive in her womb and bring forth a son?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037233"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;1:31</a></span> And will not in fact every scripture which declares that Christ had a mother? For how could she have been His mother, unless He had been in her womb? But then He received nothing from her womb which could make her a mother in whose womb He had been.  Such a name as this  a strange flesh ought not <em>to assume</em>. No flesh can speak of a mother's womb but that which is itself the offspring of that womb; nor can any be the offspring of the said womb if it owe its birth solely to itself. Therefore even <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a> must be silent although she is carrying in her womb the prophetic babe, which was already conscious of his Lord, and is, moreover, filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note037236"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;1:41</a></span> For without reason does she say, <q>and whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</q>  If it was not as her son, but only as a stranger that Mary carried Jesus in her womb, how is it she says, <q>Blessed is the fruit of your womb</q>?  What is this fruit of the womb, which received not its germ from the womb, which had not its root in the womb, which belongs not to her whose is the womb, and which is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the real fruit of the womb&mdash; even Christ? Now, since He is the blossom of the stem which sprouts from the root of Jesse; since, moreover, the root of Jesse is the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of David, and the stem of the root is Mary descended from David, and the blossom of the stem is Mary's son, who is called <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, will not He also be the fruit? For the blossom is the fruit, because through the blossom and from the blossom every product advances from its rudimental condition  to perfect fruit. What then? <em>They</em>, deny to the fruit its blossom, and to the blossom its stem, and to the stem its root; so that the root fails to secure  for itself, by means of the stem, that special product which comes from the stem, even the blossom and the fruit; for every step indeed in a genealogy is traced from the latest up to the first, so that it is now a well-known fact that the flesh of Christ is inseparable,  not merely from Mary, but also from David through Mary, and from Jesse through David. <q>This fruit,</q> therefore, <q>of David's loins,</q> that is to say, of his posterity in the flesh, God swears to him that <q>He will raise up to sit upon his throne.</q>  If <q>of David's loins,</q> how much rather is He of Mary's loins, by virtue of whom He is in <q>the loins of David?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 22. Holy Scripture in the New Testament, Even in Its Very First Verse, Testifies to Christ's True Flesh. In Virtue of Which He is Incorporated in the Human Stock of David, and Abraham, and Adam</h2>

<p>They may, then, obliterate the testimony of the devils which proclaimed Jesus the son of David; but whatever unworthiness there be in this testimony, that of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> they will never be able to efface. There is, first of all, Matthew, that most faithful chronicler  of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, because the companion of the Lord; for no other reason in the world than to show us clearly the fleshly original  of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he thus begins <em>his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>: <q>The book of the generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the son of David, the son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037245"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;1:1</a></span> With a nature issuing from such fountal sources, and an order gradually descending to the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, what else have we here described than the very flesh of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and of David conveying itself down, step after step, to the very virgin, and at last introducing Christ,&mdash; nay, producing Christ Himself of the virgin? Then, again, there is <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who was at once both a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, and a master, and a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the selfsame <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; as an apostle of the same Christ, also, he affirms that Christ <q>was made of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, according to the flesh,</q> &mdash; which, therefore, was His own likewise. Christ's flesh, then, is of David's seed. Since He is of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> in consequence of Mary's flesh, He is therefore of Mary's flesh because of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. In what way so ever you torture the statement, He is either of the flesh of Mary because of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, or He is of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> because of the flesh of Mary. The whole discussion is terminated by the same apostle, when he declares Christ to be <q>the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> And if of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, how much more, to be sure, of David, as a more recent <em>progenitor</em>! For, unfolding the promised blessing upon all nations in the person  of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <q>And in your seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed,</q> he adds, <q>He says not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037248"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;3:8,&nbsp;16</a></span> When we read and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> these things, what sort of flesh ought we, and can we, acknowledge in Christ?

<p>We acknowledge, however, that the prophetic declaration of Simeon is fulfilled, which he spoke over the recently-born Saviour:  <q>Behold, this <em>child</em> is set for the fall and rising again of many in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and for a sign that shall be spoken against.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037251"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;2:34</a></span> The sign (here meant) is that of the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to Isaiah: <q>Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you <em>a sign</em>: behold, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive and bear a son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037252"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;7:14</a></span> We discover, then, what the sign is which is to be spoken against&mdash; the conception and the parturition of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, concerning which these sophists  say: <q>She a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and yet not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> bare, and yet did not bear;</q> just as if such language, if indeed it must be uttered, would not be more suitable even for ourselves to use! For <q>she bare,</q> because she produced offspring of her own flesh and <q>yet she did not bear,</q> since she produced Him not from a husband's seed; she was <q>a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>,</q> so far as (abstinence) from a husband went, and <q>yet not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>,</q> as regards her bearing a child. <em>There is not, however, that parity of reasoning which the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> affect: in other words</em> it does not follow that for the reason <q>she did not bear,</q>  she who was <q>not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a></q> was <q>yet a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>,</q> even because she became a mother without any fruit of her own womb. But with us there is no equivocation, nothing twisted into a double sense.  Light is light; and darkness, darkness; yea is yea; and nay, nay; <q>whatsoever is more than these comes of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037256"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;5:37</a></span> She who bare (really) bare; and although she was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> when she conceived, she was a wife  when she brought forth <em>her son</em>. Now, as a wife, she was under the very law of <q>opening the womb,</q>  wherein it was quite immaterial whether the birth of the male was by virtue of a husband's co-operation or not;  it was the same sex  that opened her womb. Indeed, hers is the womb on account of which it is written of others also: <q>Every male that opens the womb shall be called <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</q>  For who is really <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? Who properly opened the womb but He who opened <em>a closed one</em>?  But it is marriage which opens the womb in all cases. <em>The virgin's womb</em>, therefore, was especially  opened, because it was especially closed. Indeed  she ought rather to be called not a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> than a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, becoming a mother at a leap, as it were, before she was a wife. And what must be said more on this point? Since it was in this sense that the apostle declared that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was born not of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, but <q>of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q> he in that statement recognised the condition of the <q>opened womb</q> which ensues in marriage.  We read in Ezekiel of <q>a heifer  which brought forth, and still did not bring forth.</q> Now, see whether it was not in view of your own future contentions about the womb of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, that even then the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> set His mark upon you in this passage; otherwise  He would not, contrary to His usual simplicity of style (in this <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>), have uttered a sentence of such doubtful import, <em>especially</em> when Isaiah says, <q>She shall conceive and bear a son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037268"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;7:14</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 24. Divine Strictures on Various Heretics Descried in Various Passages of Prophetical Scripture. Those Who Assail the True Doctrine of the One Lord Jesus Christ, Both God and Man, Thus Condemned</h2>

<p>For when Isaiah hurls denunciation against our very <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, especially in his <q>Woe to them that call <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> good, and put darkness for light,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037269"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;5:20</a></span> he of course sets his mark upon those among you  who preserve not in the words they employ the light of their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> significance, (by taking care) that the <em><a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></em> should mean only that which is so called, and the <em>flesh</em> simply that which is confest to our view, and <em>God</em> none other than the One who is preached.  Having thus <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> in his prophetic view, he says, <q>I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there is none else; there is no God beside me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037272"><a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;45:5</a></span> And when in another passage he says, in like manner, <q>Before me there was no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037273"><a href="../bible/isa046.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;46:9</a></span> he strikes at those inexplicable genealogies of the Valentinian <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>. Again, there is an answer to Ebion in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>: <q>Born,  not of blood, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> In like manner, in the passage, <q>If even an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of heaven preach unto you any other gospel than <em>that which</em> we <em>have</em> preached unto you, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037275"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;1:8</a></span> he calls attention to the artful influence of Philumene,  the virgin friend of <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a>. Surely he is antichrist who denies that Christ has come in the flesh. <span class="stiki" id="note037277"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:3</a></span> By declaring that His flesh is simply and absolutely <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and taken in the plain sense of its own nature, <em>the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a></em> aims a blow at all who make distinctions in it.  In the same way, also, when it defines the very Christ to be but one, it shakes the fancies of those who exhibit a multiform Christ, who make Christ to be one being and Jesus another&mdash;representing one as escaping out of the midst of the crowds, and the other as detained by them; one as appearing on a solitary mountain to three companions, clothed with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in a cloud, the other as an ordinary man holding intercourse with all,  one as magnanimous, but the other as timid; lastly, one as suffering death, the other as risen again, by means of which event they maintain a resurrection of their own also, only in another flesh. Happily, however, He who suffered <q>will come again from heaven,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note037280"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;1:11</a></span> and by all shall He be seen, who rose again from the dead. They too who crucified Him shall see and acknowledge Him; that is to say, His very flesh, against which they spent their fury, and without which it would be impossible for Himself either to exist or to be seen; so that they must blush with shame who affirm that His flesh sits in heaven void of sensation, like a sheath only, Christ being withdrawn from it; as well as those who (maintain) that His flesh and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are just the same thing,  or else that His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is all that exists,  but that His flesh no longer lives.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25. Conclusion. This Treatise Forms a Preface to the Other Work, <q>On the Resurrection of the Flesh,</q> Proving the Reality of the Flesh Which Was Truly Born, and Died, and Rose Again</h2>

<p>But let this suffice on our present subject; for I think that by this time <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> enough has been adduced of the flesh in Christ having both been born of the virgin, and being <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> in its nature. And this discussion alone might have been sufficient, without encountering the isolated opinions which have been raised from different quarters. We have, however, challenged these opinions to the test, both of the arguments which sustain them, and of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which are appealed to, and this we have done <em>ex abundanti</em>; so that we have, by showing what the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was, and whence it was derived, also predetermined the question, against all objectors, of what that flesh was not. The resurrection, however, of our own flesh will have to be maintained in another little treatise, and so bring to a close this present one, which serves as a general preface, and which will pave the way <em>for the approaching subject</em> now that it is plain what kind of body that was which rose again in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>
