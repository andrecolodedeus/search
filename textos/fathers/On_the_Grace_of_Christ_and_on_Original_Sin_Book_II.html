<h1>On the Grace of Christ, and on Original Sin (Book II)</h1>

<p> <em>Wherein Augustine shows that Pelagius really differs in no respect, on the question of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of infants, from his follower C&oelig;lestius, who, refusing to acknowledge original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and even daring to deny the doctrine in public, was condemned in trials before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>&mdash; first at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and afterwards at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; for this question is not, as these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> would have it, one wherein <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> might <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> without danger to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, indeed, aimed at nothing else than the very foundations of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> belief. He afterwards refutes all such as maintained that the blessing of matrimony is disparaged by the doctrine of original depravity, and an injury done to God himself, the Creator of man who is born by means of matrimony.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1 [I.]&mdash; Caution Needed in Attending to Pelagius' Deliverances on Infant Baptism.</h2>

<p>Next I beg of you,  carefully to observe with what caution you ought to lend an ear, on the question of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of infants, to men of this character, who dare not openly deny the laver of regeneration and the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to this early age, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ears would not bear to listen to them; and who yet persist in holding and urging their opinion, that the carnal generation is not held guilty of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, although they seem to allow infants to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. You have, indeed, yourselves informed me in your letter, that you heard Pelagius say in your presence, reading out of that book of his which he declared that he had also sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that they maintain that <q>infants ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the same formula of sacramental words as adults.</q>  Who, after that statement, would suppose that one ought to raise any question at all on this subject? Or if he did, to whom would he not seem to indulge a very <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> disposition&mdash; previous to the perusal of their plain assertions, in which they deny that infants inherit original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and contend that all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are born free from all corruption?</p>

<h2>Chapter 2 [II.]&mdash; C&oelig;lestius, on His Trial at Carthage, Refuses to Condemn His Error; The Written Statement Which He Gave to Zosimus.</h2>

<p>C&oelig;lestius, indeed, maintained this erroneous doctrine with less restraint. To such an extent did he push his freedom as actually to refuse, when on trial before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>,  to condemn those who say, <q>That Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> injured only <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> himself, and not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; and that infants at their birth are in the same state that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was in before his transgression.</q>  In the written statement, too, which he presented to the most blessed Pope Zosimus at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he declared with special plainness, <q>that original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> binds no single infant.</q> Concerning the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> proceedings at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> we copy the following account of his words.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3 [III.]&mdash; Part of the Proceedings of the Council of Carthage Against C&oelig;lestius.</h2>

<p><q>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Aurelius said: 'Let what follows be recited.' It was accordingly recited, 'That the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was injurious to him alone, and not to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.' Then, after the recital, C&oelig;lestius said: 'I said that I was in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the transmission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,  but so as to yield assent to any man whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has gifted with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for I have heard different opinions from those who have been even appointed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.' The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Paulinus  said: 'Tell us their names.' C&oelig;lestius answered: 'The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Rufinus,  who lived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pammachius. I have heard him declare that there is no transmission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.' The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Paulinus then asked: 'Is there any one else?' C&oelig;lestius replied: 'I have heard more say the same.' The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Paulinus rejoined: 'Tell us their names.' C&oelig;lestius said: 'Is not one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> enough for you?'</q> Then afterwards in another place we read: The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Aurelius said: 'Let the rest of the accusation be read.' It then was recited 'That infants at their birth are in the same state that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was before the transgression;' and they read to the very end of the brief accusation which had been previously put in. [IV.] The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Aurelius inquired: 'Have you, C&oelig;lestius, taught at any time, as the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Paulinus has stated, that infants are at their birth in the same state that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was before his transgression?' C&oelig;lestius answered: 'Let him explain what he meant when he said, <q> <em>before the transgression</em>.'</q> The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Paulinus then said: 'Do you on your side deny that you ever taught this doctrine? It must be one of two things: he must either say that he never so taught, or else he must now condemn the opinion.' C&oelig;lestius rejoined: 'I have already said, Let him explain the words he mentioned, <q> <em>before the transgression</em>.</q>' The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Paulinus then said: 'You must deny ever having taught this.' The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Aurelius said: 'I ask, What conclusion I have on my part to draw from this man's obstinacy; my affirmation is, that although Adam, as created in Paradise, is said to have been made <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> at first, he afterwards became corruptible through transgressing the commandment. Do you say this, brother Paulinus?' 'I do, my lord,' answered the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Paulinus. Then the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Aurelius said: 'As regards the condition of infants before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> at the present day, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Paulinus wishes to be informed whether it is such as Adam's was before the transgression; and whether it derives the guilt of transgression from the same origin of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from which it is born?' The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Paulinus asked: 'Let him deny whether he taught this, or not.' C&oelig;lestius answered: 'As touching the transmission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, I have already asserted, that I have heard many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of acknowledged position in the catholic Church deny it altogether; and on the other hand, others affirm it: it may be fairly deemed a matter for inquiry, but not a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. I have always maintained that infants require <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. What else does he want?'</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; C&oelig;lestius Concedes Baptism for Infants, Without Affirming Original Sin.</h2>

<p>You, of course, see that C&oelig;lestius here conceded <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for infants only in such a manner as to be unwilling to confess that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the first man, which is washed away in the laver of regeneration, passes over to them, although at the same time he did not venture to deny this; and on account of this <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he refused to condemn those who maintain <q>That Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> injured only himself, and not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>;</q> and <q>that infants at their birth are in the same condition wherein <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was before the transgression.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 5 [V.]&mdash; C&oelig;lestius' Book Which Was Produced in the Proceedings at Rome.</h2>

<p>But in the book which he published at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and produced in the proceedings before the church there, he so speaks on this question as to show that he really believes what he had professed to be in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about. For these are his words:  <q>That infants, however, ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to the rule of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> universal, and according to the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, we confess. For the Lord has determined that the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> should only be conferred on <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note151936"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;3:5</a></span> and since the resources of nature do not possess it, it must necessarily be conferred by the gift of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> Now if he had not said anything elsewhere on this subject, who would not have supposed that he acknowledged the remission of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> even in infants at their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, by saying that they ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? Hence the point of what you have stated in your letter, that Pelagius' answer to you was on this wise, <q>That infants are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the same words of sacramental formula as adults,</q> and that you were rejoiced to hear the very thing which you were desirous of hearing, and yet that you preferred holding a consultation with us concerning his words.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6 [VI.]&mdash; C&oelig;lestius the Disciple is In This Work Bolder Than His Master.</h2>

<p>Carefully observe, then, what C&oelig;lestius has advanced so very openly, and you will discover what amount of concealment Pelagius has practised upon you. C&oelig;lestius goes on to say as follows: <q>That infants, however, must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, was not admitted by us with the view of our seeming to affirm <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by transmission. This is very alien from the catholic meaning, because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not born with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>&mdash;it is subsequently committed by the man for it is shown to be a fault, not of nature, but of the will. It is fitting, therefore, to confess this, lest we should seem to make different kinds of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; it is, moreover, necessary to lay down this preliminary safeguard, lest by the occasion of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should, to the disparagement of the Creator, be said to be conveyed to man by nature, before that it has been committed by man.</q> Now Pelagius was either afraid or ashamed to avow this to be his own opinion before you; although his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> experienced neither a qualm nor a blush in openly professing it to be his, without any obscure subterfuges, in presence of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; Pope Zosimus Kindly Excuses Him.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, however, who presides over this See, upon seeing him hurrying headlong in so great presumption like a madman, chose in his great compassion, with a view to the man's repentance, if it might be, rather to bind him tightly by eliciting from him answers to questions proposed by himself, than by the stroke of a severe condemnation to drive him over the precipice, down which he seemed to be even now ready to fall. I say advisedly, <q>down which he seemed to be ready to fall,</q> rather than <q>over which he had actually fallen,</q> because he had already in this same book of his forecast the subject with an intended reference to questions of this sort in the following words: <q>If it should so happen that any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> has stolen over us <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, let it be corrected by your decisive sentence.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 8 [VII.]&mdash; C&oelig;lestius Condemned by Zosimus.</h2>

<p>The venerable Pope Zosimus, keeping in view this deprecatory preamble, dealt with the man, puffed up as he was with the blasts of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a>, so as that he should condemn all the objectionable points which had been alleged against him by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Paulinus, and that he should yield his assent to the rescript of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> which had been issued by his predecessor of sacred memory. The accused man, however, refused to condemn the objections raised by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, yet he did not dare to hold out against the letter of the blessed Pope Innocent; indeed, he went so far as to <q>promise that he would condemn all the points which the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> condemned.</q> Thus the man was treated with gentle remedies, as a delirious patient who required rest; but, at the same time, he was not regarded as being yet ready to be released from the restraints of excommunication. The interval of two months being granted him, until communications could be received from Africa, a place for recovery was conceded to him, under the mild restorative of the sentence which had been pronounced. For in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, if he would have laid aside his vain obstinacy, and be now willing to carry out what he had undertaken, and would carefully read the very letter to which he had replied by promising submission, he would yet come to a better mind. But after the rescripts were duly issued from the council of the African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, there were very good reasons why the sentence should be carried out against him, in strictest accordance with equity. What these reasons were you may read for yourselves, for we have sent you all the particulars.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9 [VIII.]&mdash; Pelagius Deceived the Council in Palestine, But Was Unable to Deceive the Church at Rome.</h2>

<p>Wherefore Pelagius, too, if he will only reflect candidly on his own position and writings, has no reason for saying that he ought not to have been banned with such a sentence. For although he deceived the council in Palestine, seemingly clearing himself before it, he entirely failed in imposing on the church at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (where, as you well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, he is by no means a stranger), although he went so far as to make the attempt, if he might somehow succeed. But, as I have just said, he entirely failed. For the most blessed Pope Zosimus recollected what his predecessor, who had set him so worthy an example, had thought of these very proceedings. Nor did he omit to observe what opinion was entertained about this man by the trusty Romans, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> deserved to be spoken of in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note151937"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;1:8</a></span> and whose consistent <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in defence of catholic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> against this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> he saw prevailing among them with warmth, and at the same time most perfect harmony. The man had lived among them for a long while, and his opinions could not escape their notice; moreover, they had so completely found out his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> C&oelig;lestius, as to be able at once to adduce the most trustworthy and irrefragable evidence on this subject. Now what was the solemn judgment which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pope Innocent formed respecting the proceedings in the Synod of Palestine, by which Pelagius boasts of having been acquitted, you may indeed read in the letter which he addressed to me. It is duly mentioned also in the answer which was forwarded by the African Synod to the venerable Pope Zosimus and which, along with the other instructions, we have dispatched to your loving selves.  But it seems to me, at the same time, that I ought not to omit producing the particulars in the present work.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10 [IX.]&mdash; The Judgment of Innocent Respecting the Proceedings in Palestine.</h2>

<p>Five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, then, of whom I was one, wrote him a letter,  wherein we mentioned the proceedings in Palestine, of which the report had already reached us. We informed him that in the East, where this man lived, there had taken place certain <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> proceedings, in which he was thought to have been acquitted on all the charges. To this communication from us Innocent replied in a letter which contains the following among other words: <q>There are,</q> says he, <q>sundry positions, as stated in these very Proceedings, which, when they were objected against him, he partly suppressed by avoiding them, and partly confused in absolute obscurity, by wresting the sense of many words; while there are other allegations which he cleared off&mdash;not, indeed, in the honest way which he might seem at the time to use, but rather by methods of sophistry, meeting some of the objections with a flat denial, and tampering with others by a fallacious interpretation. Would, however, that he would even now adopt what is the far more desirable course of turning from his own <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> back to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> ways of catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; that he would also, duly considering God's daily <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and acknowledging the help thereof, be willing and desirous to appear, amidst the approbation of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> corrected by the method of open conviction&mdash;not, indeed, by judicial process, but by a hearty conversion to the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. We are therefore unable either to approve of or to blame their proceedings at that trial; for we cannot tell whether the proceedings were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, or even, if <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whether they do not really show that the man escaped by subterfuge, rather than that he cleared himself by entire <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>  You see clearly from these words, how that the most blessed Pope Innocent without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> speaks of this man as of one who was by no means unknown to him. You see what opinion he entertained about his acquittal. You see, moreover, what his successor the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pope Zosimus was bound to recollect,&mdash; as in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> he did&mdash;so as to confirm without hesitation the judgment of his predecessor in this case.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11 [X.]&mdash; How that Pelagius Deceived the Synod of Palestine.</h2>

<p>Now I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you carefully to observe by what evidence Pelagius is shown to have deceived his judges in Palestine, not to mention other points, on this very question of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of infants, lest we should seem to any one to have used <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> and suspicion, rather than to have ascertained the certain fact, when we alleged that Pelagius concealed the opinion which C&oelig;lestius expressed with greater frankness, while at the same time he actually entertained the same views. Now, from what has been stated above, it has been clearly seen that C&oelig;lestius refused to condemn the assertion that <q>Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> injured only himself, and not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and that infants at their birth are in the same state that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was before the transgression,</q> because he saw that, if he condemned these propositions, he would affirm that there was in infants a transmission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from Adam. When, however, it was objected to Pelagius that he was of one mind with C&oelig;lestius on this point, he condemned the words without hesitation. I am quite aware that you have read all this before. Since, however, we are not writing this account for you alone, we proceed to transcribe the very words of the synodal acts, lest the reader should be unwilling either to turn to the record for himself, or if he does not possess it, take the trouble to procure a copy. Here, then, are the words:&mdash; </p>

<h2>Chapter 12 [XI.]&mdash; A Portion of the Proceedings of the Synod of Palestine in the Cause of Pelagius.</h2>

<p><q>The synod said:  Now, forasmuch as Pelagius has pronounced his <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> on this uncertain utterance of folly, rightly replying that a man by God's help and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is able to live <span class="greek">&#x1F00;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03BC;&#x1F71;&#x03C1;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>, that is to say, without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, let him give us his answer on other articles also. Another particular in the teaching of C&oelig;lestius, <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Pelagius, selected from the heads which were mentioned and heard at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> before the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Aurelius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, was to this effect: 'That <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was made mortal, and that he would have died, whether he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> or did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; that Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> injured himself alone, and not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; that the law no less than the gospel leads us to the kingdom; that before the coming of Christ there were <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; that newborn infants are in the same condition that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was before the transgression; that, on the one hand, the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> does not die on account of Adam's death and transgression, nor, on the other hand, does the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> rise again through the resurrection of Christ; that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Augustine wrote a book in answer to his followers in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, on articles which were subjoined, and in this book, which was addressed to Hilary, are contained the following statements: That a man is able to be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if he wishes; that infants, even if they are unbaptized, have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; that rich men, even if they are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, unless they renounce and give up all, have, whatever good they may seem to have done, nothing of it reckoned unto them, neither can they possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.' Pelagius then said: As regards man's ability to be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, my opinion has been already spoken. With respect, however, to the allegation that there were even before the Lord's coming <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who lived without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we also on our part say, that before the coming of Christ there certainly were <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who passed their lives in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and righteousness, according to the accounts which have been handed down to us in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>. As for the other points, indeed, even on their own showing, they are not of a character which obliges me to be answerable for them; but yet, for the satisfaction of the sacred Synod, I <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> those who either now hold or have ever held these opinions.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 13 [XII.]&mdash; C&oelig;lestius the Bolder Heretic; Pelagius the More Subtle.</h2>

<p>You see, indeed, not to mention other points, how that Pelagius pronounced his <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> against those who hold that <q>Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> injured only himself, and not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; and that infants are at their birth in the same condition in which <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was before the transgression.</q> Now what else could the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who sat in judgment on him have possibly understood him to mean by this, but that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is transmitted to infants? It was to avoid making such an admission that C&oelig;lestius refused to condemn this statement, which this man on the contrary <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>. If, therefore, I shall show that he did not really entertain any other opinion concerning infants than that they are born without any contagion of a single <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, what difference will there remain on this question between him and C&oelig;lestius, except this, that the one is more open, the other more reserved; the one more pertinacious, the other more mendacious; or, at any rate, that the one is more candid, the other more astute? For, the one before the church of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> refused to condemn what he afterwards in the church at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> publicly confessed to be a tenet of his own; at the same time professing himself <q>ready to submit to correction if an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> had stolen over him, considering that he was but <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>;</q> whereas the other both condemned this dogma as being contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> lest he should himself be condemned by his catholic judges, and yet kept it in reserve for subsequent defence, so that either his condemnation was a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, or his interpretation a trick.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14 [XIII.]&mdash; He Shows That, Even After the Synod of Palestine, Pelagius Held the Same Opinions as C&oelig;lestius on the Subject of Original Sin.</h2>

<p>I see, however, that it may be most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> demanded of me, that I do not defer my promised demonstration, that he actually entertains the same views as C&oelig;lestius. In the first book of his more recent work, written in defence of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> (which work he mentions in the letter he dispatched to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>), he says: <q>Everything good, and everything <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, on account of which we are either laudable or blameworthy, is not born with us but done by us: for we are born not fully developed, but with a capacity for either conduct; and we are procreated as without <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so also without <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>; and previous to the action of our own proper will, that alone is in man which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has formed.</q> Now you perceive that in these words of Pelagius, the dogma of both these men is contained, that infants are born without the contagion of any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from Adam. It is therefore not astonishing that C&oelig;lestius refused to condemn such as say that Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> injured only himself, and not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; and that infants are at their birth in the same state in which <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was before the transgression. But it is very much to be wondered at, that Pelagius had the effrontery to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> these opinions. For if, as he alleges, <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not born with us, and we are procreated without fault, and the only thing in man previous to the action of his own will is what God has formed,</q> then of course the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> did only injure himself, inasmuch as it did not pass on to his offspring. For there is not any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is not an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; or a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is not a fault; or else <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But he says: <q>Evil is not born with us, and we are procreated without fault; and the only thing in men at their birth is what God has formed.</q> Now, since by this language he supposes it to be most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that, according to the well-known sentence of his: <q>Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was injurious to himself alone, and not to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>,</q> why did Pelagius condemn this, if it were not for the purpose of deceiving his catholic judges? By parity of reasoning, it may also be argued: <q>If <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not born with us, and if we are procreated without fault, and if the only thing found in man at the time of his birth is what God has formed,</q> it follows beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <q>infants at their birth are in the same condition that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was before the transgression,</q> in whom no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or fault was inherent, and in whom that alone <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had formed. And yet Pelagius pronounced <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> on all those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <q>who hold now, or have at any time held, that newborn babes are placed by their birth in the same state that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was in before the transgression,</q>&mdash; in other words, are without any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, without any fault, having that only which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had formed. Now, why again did Pelagius condemn this tenet also, if it were not for the purpose of deceiving the catholic Synod, and saving himself from the condemnation of an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> innovator?</p>

<h2>Chapter 15 [XIV.]&mdash; Pelagius by His Mendacity and Deception Stole His Acquittal from the Synod in Palestine.</h2>

<p>For my own part, however, I, as you are quite aware, and as I also stated in the book which I addressed to our venerable and aged Aurelius on the proceedings in Palestine, really felt glad that Pelagius in that answer of his had exhausted the whole of this question.  To me, indeed, he seemed most plainly to have acknowledged that there is original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in infants, by the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> which he pronounced against those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who supposed that by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> only himself, and not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, was injured, and who entertained the opinion that infants are in the same state in which the first man was before the transgression. When, however, I had read his four books (from the first of which I copied the words which I have just now quoted), and discovered that he was still cherishing thoughts which were opposed to the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> touching infants, I felt all the greater surprise at a mendacity which he so unblushingly maintained in a synod of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and on so great a question. For if he had already written these books, how did he profess to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> those who had ever entertained the opinions alluded to? If he purposed, however, afterwards to publish such a work, how could he <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> those who at the time were holding the opinions? Unless, to be sure, by some ridiculous subterfuge he meant to say that the objects of his <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> were such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as had in some previous time held, or were then holding, these opinions; but that in respect of the future&mdash; that is, as regarded those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who were about to take up with such views&mdash; he felt that it would be impossible for him to prejudge either himself or other people, and that therefore he was guilty of no lie when he was afterwards detected in the maintenance of similar <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. This plea, however, he does not advance, not only because it is a ridiculous one, but because it cannot possibly be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; because in these very books of his he both argues against the transmission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to infants, and glories in the proceedings of the Synod in Palestine, where he was supposed to have sincerely <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> such as hold the opinions in dispute, and where he, in fact, stole his acquittal by practising deceit.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16 [XV.]&mdash; Pelagius' Fraudulent and Crafty Excuses.</h2>

<p>For what is the significance to the matter with which we now have to do of his answers to his followers, when he tells them that <q>the reason why he condemned the points which were objected against him, is because he himself maintains that primal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was injurious not only to the first man, but to the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, not by transmission, but by example;</q> in other words, not because those who have been propagated from him have derived any fault from him, but because all who afterwards have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, have imitated him who committed the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Or when he says that <q>the reason why infants are not in the same state in which <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was before the transgression, is because they are not yet able to receive the commandment, whereas he was able; and because they do not yet make use of that choice of a rational will which he certainly made use of, since otherwise no commandment would have been given to him</q>? How does such an exposition as this of the points alleged against him justify him in thinking that he rightly condemned the propositions, <q>Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> injured only himself, and not the whole race of man;</q> and <q>infants at their birth are in the self-same state in which <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was before he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>;</q> and that by the said condemnation he is not guilty of deceit in holding such opinions as are found in his subsequent writings, how that <q>infants are born without any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or fault, and that there is nothing in them but what God has formed,</q>&mdash; no wound, in short, inflicted by an enemy?</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.&mdash; How Pelagius Deceived His Judges.</h2>

<p>Now, is it by making such statements as these, meeting objections which are urged in one sense with explanations which are meant in another, that he designs to prove to us that he did not deceive those who sat in judgment on him? Then he utterly fails in his purpose. In proportion to the craftiness of his explanations, was the stealthiness with which he deceived them. For, just because they were catholic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, when they heard the man pouring out <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a> upon those who maintained that <q>Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was injurious to none but himself, and not to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>,</q> they understood him to assert nothing but what the catholic Church has been accustomed to declare, on the ground of which it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> baptizes infants for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>&mdash; not, indeed, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which they have committed by imitation owing to the example of the first sinner, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which they have contracted by their very birth, owing to the corruption of their origin. When, again, they heard him <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> those who assert that <q>infants at their birth are in the same state in which <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was before the transgression,</q> they supposed him to refer to none others than those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who <q>think that infants have derived no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from Adam, and that they are accordingly in that state that he was in before his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> For, of course, no other objection would be brought against him than that on which the question turned. When, therefore, he so explains the objection as to say that infants are not in the same state that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was in before he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, simply because they have not yet arrived at the same firmness of mind or body, not because of any propagated fault that has passed on to them, he must be answered thus: <q>When the objections were laid against you for condemnation, the catholic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> did not understand them in this sense; therefore, when you condemned them, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that you were a catholic. That, accordingly, which they supposed you to maintain, deserved to be released from censure; but that which you really maintained was worthy of condemnation. It was not you, then, that were acquitted, who held tenets which ought to be condemned; but that opinion was freed from censure which you ought to have held and maintained. You could only be supposed to be acquitted by having been <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to entertain opinions worthy to be praised; for your judges could not suppose that you were concealing opinions which merited condemnation. Rightly have you been adjudged an accomplice of C&oelig;lestius, in whose opinions you prove yourself to be a sharer. And though you kept your books shut during your trial, you published them to the world after it was over.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 18 [XVII.]&mdash; The Condemnation of Pelagius.</h2>

<p>This being the case, you of course feel that episcopal councils, and the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, and the whole Roman Church, and the Roman Empire itself,  which by God's gracious favour has become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, has been most righteously moved against the authors of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, until they repent and escape from the snares of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For who can tell whether God may not give them repentance to discover, and acknowledge, and even proclaim His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note151944"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse25">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:25-26</a></span> and to condemn their own damnable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>? But whatever may be the bent of their own will, we cannot <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the merciful kindness of the Lord has sought the good of many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who followed them, for no other reason than because they saw them associated in communion with the catholic Church.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; Pelagius' Attempt to Deceive the Apostolic See; He Inverts the Bearings of the Controversy.</h2>

<p>But I would have you carefully observe the way in which Pelagius endeavoured by deception to overreach even the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> on this very question of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of infants. He sent a letter to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to Pope Innocent of blessed memory; and when it found him not in the flesh, it was handed to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pope Zosimus, and by him directed to us. In this letter he complains of being <q>defamed by certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> for refusing the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to infants, and promising the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> irrespective of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> redemption.</q> The objections, however, are not urged against them in the manner he has stated. For they neither deny the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to infants, nor do they promise the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> to any irrespective of the redemption of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. As regards, therefore, his complaint of being defamed by sundry <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, he has set it forth in such terms as to be able to give a ready answer to the alleged charge against him, without injury to his own dogma. [XVIII.] The real objection against them is, that they refuse to confess that unbaptized infants are liable to the condemnation of the first man, and that original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been transmitted to them and requires to be purged by regeneration; their contention being that infants must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> solely for being admitted into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, as if they could only have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death apart from the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, who cannot have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life without partaking of the Lord's body and blood. This, I would have you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, is the real objection to them respecting the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of infants; and not as he has represented it, for the purpose of enabling himself to save his own <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> while answering what is actually a proposition of his own, under colour of meeting an objection.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; Pelagius Provides a Refuge for His Falsehood in Ambiguous Subterfuges.</h2>

<p>And then observe how he makes his answer, how he provides in the obscure mazes of his double sense retreats for his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a>, quenching the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in his dark mist of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; so that even we, on our first perusal of his words, almost rejoiced at their propriety and correctness. But the fuller discussions in his books, in which he is generally forced, in spite of all his efforts at concealment, to explain his meaning, have made even his better statements suspicious to us, lest on a closer inspection of them we should detect them to be ambiguous. For, after saying that <q>he had never heard even an impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> say this</q> (namely, what he set forth as the objection) <q>about infants,</q> he goes on to ask: <q>Who indeed is so unacquainted with <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> lessons, as not only to attempt to make such an affirmation, but even to be able to lightly say it or even let it enter his thought? And then who is so impious as to wish to exclude infants from the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, by forbidding them to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and to be born again in Christ?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 21 [XIX.]&mdash; Pelagius Avoids the Question as to Why Baptism is Necessary for Infants.</h2>

<p>Now it is to no purpose that he says all this. He does not clear himself thereby. Not even they have ever denied the impossibility of infants entering the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. But this is not the question; what we are discussing concerns the obliteration  of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in infants. Let him clear himself on this point, since he refuses to acknowledge that there is anything in infants which the laver of regeneration has to cleanse. On this account we ought carefully to consider what he has afterwards to say. After adducing, then, the passage of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which declares that <q>whosoever is not born again of water and the Spirit cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note151946"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;3:5</a></span> (on which matter, as we have said, they raise no question), he goes on at once to ask: <q>Who indeed is so impious as to have the heart to refuse the common redemption of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> to an infant of any age whatever?</q> But this is ambiguous language; for what <em> redemption</em> does he mean? Is it from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to good? Or from good to better? Now even C&oelig;lestius, at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>,  allowed a redemption for infants in his book; although, at the same time, he would not admit the transmission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to them from Adam.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22 [XX.]&mdash; Another Instance of Pelagius' Ambiguity.</h2>

<p>Then, again, observe what he subjoins to the last remark: <q>Can any one,</q> says he, <q>forbid a second birth to an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and certain life, to him who has been born to this present uncertain life?</q> In other words: <q>Who is so impious as to forbid his being born again to the life which is sure and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, who has been born to this life of uncertainty?</q> When we first read these words, we supposed that by the phrase <q>uncertain life</q> he meant to designate this present temporal life; although it appeared to us that he ought rather to have called it <q>mortal</q> than <q>uncertain,</q> because it is brought to a close by certain death. But for all this, we thought that he had only shown a preference for calling this mortal life an <em>uncertain</em> one, because of the general view which men take that there is undoubtedly not a moment in our lives when we are free from this uncertainty. And so it happened that our anxiety about him was allayed to some extent by the following consideration, which rose almost to a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, notwithstanding the fact of his unwillingness openly to confess that infants incur <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death who depart this life without the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. We argued: <q>If, as he seems to admit, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life can only accrue to them who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, it follows of course that they who die unbaptized incur everlasting death. This destiny, however, cannot by any means <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> befall those who never in this life committed any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of their own, unless on account of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 23 [XXI.]&mdash; What He Means by Our Birth to an <q>Uncertain</q> Life.</h2>

<p>Certain brethren, however, afterwards failed not to remind us that Pelagius possibly expressed himself in this way, because on this question he is represented as having his answer ready for all inquirers, to this effect: <q>As for infants who die unbaptized, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> indeed whither they go not; yet whither they go, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not;</q> that is, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> they do not go into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. But as to whither they go, he was (and for the matter of that, <em>still is</em> ) in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of saying that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, because he dared not say that those went to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death, who he was persuaded had never committed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in this life, and whom he would not admit to have inherited original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Consequently those very words of his which were forwarded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to secure his absolute acquittal, are so steeped in ambiguity that they afford a shelter for their doctrine, out of which may sally forth an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> sense to entrap the unwary straggler; for when no one is at hand who can give the answer, any solitary man may find himself weak.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.&mdash; Pelagius' Long Residence at Rome.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> indeed is, that in the book of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with this very letter  to the before-mentioned Pope Innocent, to whom also he had written the letter, he only the more evidently exposed himself by his efforts at concealment. He says:  <q>We hold one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which we say ought to be administered in the same sacramental words in the case of infants as in the case of adults.</q> He did not, however, say, <q>in the same sacrament</q> (although if he had so said, there would still have been ambiguity), but <q>in the same sacramental words,</q>&mdash; as if remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in infants were declared by the sound of the words, and not wrought by the effect of the acts. For the time, indeed, he seemed to say what was agreeable with the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but he had it not in his power permanently to deceive that see. Subsequent to the rescript of the African Council, into which province this pestilent doctrine had stealthily made its way&mdash; without, however, spreading widely or sinking deeply&mdash; other opinions also of this man were by the industry of some faithful brethren discovered and brought to light at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he had dwelt for a very long while, and had already engaged in sundry discourses and controversies. In order to procure the condemnation of these opinions, Pope Zosimus, as you may read, annexed them to his letter, which he wrote for publication throughout the catholic world. Among these statements, Pelagius, pretending to expound the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul's</a> Epistle to the Romans, argues in these words: <q>If Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> injured those who have not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, then also Christ's righteousness profits those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> He says other things, too, of the same purport; but they have all been refuted and answered by me with the Lord's help in the books which I wrote, <em>On the Baptism of Infants</em>.  But he had not the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to make those objectionable statements in his own person in the fore-mentioned so-called exposition. This particular one, however, having been enunciated in a place where he was so well known, his words and their meaning could not be disguised. In those books, from the first of which I have already before quoted,  he treats this point without any suppression of his views. With all the energy of which he is capable, he most plainly asserts that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in infants cannot in any wise be supposed to be corrupted by propagation; and by claiming <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for them as their due, he does despite to the Saviour.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25 [XXII.]&mdash; The Condemnation of Pelagius and C&oelig;lestius.</h2>

<p>These things, then, being as I have stated them, it is now evident that there has arisen a deadly <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which, with the Lord's help, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by this time guards against more directly&mdash; now that those two men, Pelagius and C&oelig;lestius, have been either offered repentance, or on their refusal been wholly condemned. They are reported, or perhaps actually <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, to be the authors of this perversion; at all events, if not the authors (as having learned it from others), they are yet its boasted abettors and teachers, through whose agency the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> has advanced and grown to a wider extent. This boast, too, is made even in their own statements and writings, and in unmistakeable signs of reality, as well as in the fame which arises and grows out of all these circumstances. What, therefore, remains to be done? Must not every catholic, with all the energies wherewith the Lord endows him, confute this pestilential doctrine, and oppose it with all vigilance; so that whenever we contend for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, compelled to answer, but not fond of the contest, the untaught may be instructed, and that thus the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may be benefited by that which the enemy devised for her destruction; in accordance with that word of the apostle's, <q>There must be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note151953"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:19</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 26 [XXIII.]&mdash; The Pelagians Maintain that Raising Questions About Original Sin Does Not Endanger the Faith.</h2>

<p>Therefore, after the full discussion with which we have been able to rebut in writing this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of theirs, which is so inimical to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God bestowed on small and great through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, it is now our duty to examine and explode that assertion of theirs, which in their desire to avoid the odious imputation of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> they astutely advance, to the effect that <q>calling this subject into question produces no danger to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q>&mdash; in order that they may appear, forsooth, if they are convicted of having deviated from it, to have erred not criminally, but only, as it were, courteously.  This, accordingly, is the language which C&oelig;lestius used in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> process at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>:  <q>As touching the transmission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> he said, <q>I have already said that I have heard many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of acknowledged position in the catholic Church deny it, and on the other hand many affirm it; it may fairly, indeed, be deemed a matter for inquiry, but not a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. I have always maintained that infants require <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. What else does he want?</q> He said this, as if he wanted to intimate that only then could he be deemed chargeable with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, if he were to assert that they ought not to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. As the case stood, however, inasmuch as he acknowledged that they ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, he thought that he had not erred [criminally], and therefore ought not to be adjudged a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, even though he maintained the reason of their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to be other than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> holds, or the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> claims as its own. On the same principle, in the book which he sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he first explained his belief, so far as it suited his pleasure, from the Trinity of the One Godhead down to the kind of resurrection of the dead that is to be; on all which points, however, no one had ever questioned him, or been questioned by him. And when his discourse reached the question which was under consideration, he said: <q>If, indeed, any questions have arisen beyond the compass of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, on which there might be perhaps dissension on the part of a great many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, in no case have I pretended to pronounce a decision on any dogma, as if I possessed a definitive authority in the matter myself; but whatever I have derived from the fountain of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, I have presented for approbation to the judgment of your apostolic office; so that if any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> has crept in among us, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> as we are, through our <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, it may be corrected by your sentence.</q>  You of course clearly see that in this action of his he used all this deprecatory preamble in order that, if he had been discovered to have erred at all, he might seem to have erred not on a matter of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but on questionable points outside the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; wherein, however necessary it may be to correct the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, it is not corrected as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; wherein also the person who undergoes the correction is declared indeed to be in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but for all that is not adjudged a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27 [XXIII.]&mdash; On Questions Outside the Faith&mdash; What They Are, and Instances of the Same.</h2>

<p>But he is greatly mistaken in this opinion. The questions which he supposes to be outside the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are of a very different character from those in which, without any detriment to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby we are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, there exists either an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the real fact, and a consequent suspension of any fixed opinion, or else a conjectural view of the case, which, owing to the infirmity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> thought, issues in conceptions at variance with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: as when a question arises about the description and locality of that Paradise where God placed man whom He formed out of the ground, without any disturbance, however, of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> belief that there undoubtedly is such a Paradise; or as when it is asked where Elijah is at the present moment, and where <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>&mdash; whether in this Paradise or in some other place, although we <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not of their existing still in the same bodies in which they were born; or as when one inquires whether it was in the body or out of the body that the apostle was caught up to the third heaven,&mdash; an inquiry, however, which betokens great lack of modesty on the part of those who would fain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he who is the subject of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> itself expressly declares his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of, <span class="stiki" id="note151957"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:2</a></span> without impairing his own belief of the fact; or as when the question is started, how many are those heavens, to the <q>third</q> of which he tells us that he was caught up; or whether the elements of this visible world are four or more; what it is which causes those eclipses of the sun or the moon which astronomers are in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of foretelling for certain appointed seasons; why, again, men of ancient times lived to the age which <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> assigns to them; and whether the period of their puberty, when they begot their first son, was postponed to an older age, proportioned to their longer life; or where <a href="../cathen/10048b.htm">Methuselah</a> could possibly have lived, since he was not in the Ark, inasmuch as (according to the chronological notes of most copies of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, both Greek and Latin) he is found to have survived the deluge; or whether we must follow the order of the fewer copies&mdash; and they happen to be extremely few&mdash; which so arrange the years as to show that he died before the deluge. Now who does not feel, amidst the various and innumerable questions of this sort, which relate either to God's most hidden operations or to most obscure passages of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and which it is difficult to embrace and define in any certain way, that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> may on many points be compatible with sound <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that occasionally erroneous opinion may be entertained without any room for the imputation of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrine?</p>

<h2>Chapter 28 [XXIV.]&mdash; The Heresy of Pelagius and C&oelig;lestius Aims at the Very Foundations of Our Faith.</h2>

<p>This is, however, in the matter of the two men by one of whom we are sold under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note151958"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;7:14</a></span> by the other redeemed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>&mdash; by the one have been precipitated into death, by the other are liberated unto life; the former of whom has ruined us in himself, by doing his own will instead of His who created him; the latter has saved us in Himself, by not doing His own will, but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him who sent Him:  and it is in what concerns these two men that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> properly consists.

And this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> both of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are mentioned in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, and of those also who are not indeed mentioned therein, but must yet be supposed to have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>&mdash;either before the deluge, or in the interval between that event and the giving of the law, or in the period of the law itself&mdash;not merely among the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but even outside that nation, as for instance Job. For it was by the self-same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the one Mediator that the hearts of these, too, were cleansed, and there also was <q>shed abroad in them the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note151963"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> <q>who blows where He lists,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note151964"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse8">John&nbsp;3:8</a></span> not following men's merits, but even producing these very merits Himself.

<h2>Chapter 29.&mdash; The Righteous Men Who Lived in the Time of the Law Were for All that Not Under the Law, But Under Grace. The Grace of the New Testament Hidden Under the Old.</h2>

<p>Death indeed reigned from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> until <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note151965"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;5:14</a></span> because it was not possible even for the law given through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to overcome it: it was not given, in fact, as something able to give life; <span class="stiki" id="note151966"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse21">Galatians&nbsp;3:21</a></span> but as something that ought to show those that were dead and for whom <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was needed to give them life, that they were not only prostrated under the propagation and domination of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also convicted by the additional guilt of breaking the law itself: not in order that any one might perish who in the mercy of God understood this even in that early age; but that, destined though he was to punishment, owing to the dominion of death, and manifested, too, as guilty through his own violation of the law, he might seek God's help, and so where <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> abounded, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> might much more abound, <span class="stiki" id="note151967"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;5:20</a></span> even the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which alone delivers from the body of this death. <span class="stiki" id="note151968"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24-25</a></span> [XXV.] Yet, notwithstanding this, although not even the law which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> gave was able to liberate any man from the dominion of death, there were even then, too, at the time of the law, men of God who were not living under the terror and conviction and punishment of the law, but under the delight and healing and liberation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Some there were who said, <q>I was shapen in iniquity, and in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> did my mother conceive me;</q>  and, <q>There is no rest in my bones, by reason of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>;</q>  and, <q>Create in me a clean heart, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and renew a right spirit in my inward parts;</q>  and, <q>Stablish me with Your directing Spirit;</q>  and, <q>Take not Your <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from me.</q>  There were some, again, who said: <q>I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, therefore have I spoken.</q>  For they too were cleansed with the self-same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with which we ourselves are.

They, indeed, who were able in faithful <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to foretell these things to us were not themselves partakers of them. The Apostle Peter says, <q>Why do you tempt God to put a yoke upon the neck of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> we shall be saved, even as they.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note151980"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse10">Acts&nbsp;15:10-11</a></span> Now on what principle does he make this statement, if it be not because even they were saved through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord Jesus Christ, and not the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, from which comes not the cure, but only the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note151981"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;3:20</a></span> Now, however, the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note151982"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;3:21</a></span> If, therefore, it is now manifested, it even then <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, but it was hidden.

Even of old, therefore there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> among the people of God this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; but like the rain in the fleece which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sets apart for His inheritance,  not of debt, but of His own will, it was latently present, but is now patently visible among all nations as its <q>floor,</q> the fleece being dry&mdash;in other words, the Jewish people having become reprobate. <span class="stiki" id="note151985"><a href="../bible/jdg006.htm#verse36">Judges&nbsp;6:36-40</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 30 [XXVI]&mdash; Pelagius and C&oelig;lestius Deny that the Ancient Saints Were Saved by Christ.</h2>

<p>We must not therefore divide the times, as Pelagius and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> do, who say that men first lived righteously by nature, then under the law, thirdly under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>&mdash;by nature meaning all the long time from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> before the giving of the law. <q>For then,</q> say they, <q>the Creator was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the guidance of reason; and the rule of living rightly was carried written in the hearts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not in the law of the letter, but of nature. But men's manners became corrupt; and then,</q> they say, <q>when nature now tarnished began to be insufficient, the law was added to it whereby as by a moon the original lustre was restored to nature after its blush was impaired. But after the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of sinning had too much prevailed among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the law was unequal to the task of curing it, Christ came; and the Physician Himself, through His own self, and not through His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, brought relief to the malady at its most desperate development.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 31.&mdash; Christ's Incarnation Was of Avail to the Fathers, Even Though It Had Not Yet Happened.</h2>

<p>By disputation of this sort, they attempt to exclude the ancient <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Mediator, as if the man Christ Jesus were not the Mediator between God and <em>those men</em>; on the ground that, not having yet taken flesh of the Virgin's womb, He was not yet man at the time when those righteous men lived. If this, however, were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, in vain would the apostle say: <q>By man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead; for as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note151986"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:21-22</a></span> For inasmuch as those ancient <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, according to the vain conceits of these men, found their nature self-sufficient, and required not the man Christ to be their Mediator to reconcile them to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so neither shall they be made alive in Him, to whose body they are shown not to belong as members, according to the statement that it was on man's account that He became man. If, however, as the Truth says through His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, even as all die in Adam, even so shall all be made alive in Christ; forasmuch as the resurrection of the dead comes through the one man, even as death comes through the other man; what <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man can be bold enough to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that even those righteous men who pleased God in the more remote periods of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> are destined to attain to the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death, because they shall be made alive in Christ? That they are made alive in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because they belong to the body of Christ? That they belong to the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because Christ is the head even to them? <span class="stiki" id="note151987"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3</a></span> and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the head even to them, because there is but one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus? But this He could not have been to them, unless through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> they had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. And how could they have done this, if they had been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that He was to come in the flesh, and if they had not by this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> lived <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> and piously? Now, if the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of Christ could be of no concern to them, on the ground that it had not yet come about, it must follow that Christ's judgment can be of no concern to us, because it has not yet taken place. But if we shall stand at the right hand of Christ through our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His judgment, which has not yet transpired, but is to come to pass, it follows that those ancient <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are members of Christ through their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, which had not in their day happened, but which was one day to come to pass.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32 [XXVII.]&mdash; He Shows by the Example of Abraham that the Ancient Saints Believed in the Incarnation of Christ.</h2>

<p>For it must not be supposed that those <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of old only profited by Christ's divinity, which was ever existent, and not also by the revelation of His humanity, which had not yet come to pass. What the Lord Jesus says, <q><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> desired to see my day, and he saw it, and was glad,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note151988"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse56">John&nbsp;8:56</a></span> meaning by the phrase <em>his day</em> to understand <em>his time</em>, affords of course a clear testimony that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was fully imbued with belief in His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>. It is in respect of this that He has a <q>time;</q> for His divinity exceeds all time, for it was by it that all times were created. If, however, any one supposes that the phrase in question must be understood of that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>  <q>day</q> which is limited by no morrow, and preceded by no yesterday&mdash;in a word, of the very <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in which He is co-eternal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>&mdash;how would <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> really desire this, unless he was aware that there was to be a future mortality belonging to Him whose <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> he wished for? Or, perhaps, some one would confine the meaning of the phrase so far as to say, that nothing else is meant in the Lord's saying, <q>He desired to see my day,</q> than <q>He desired to see me,</q> who am the never-ending Day, or the unfailing Light, as when we mention the life of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, concerning which it is said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>So has He given to the Son to have life in Himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note151989"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;5:26</a></span> Here the life is nothing less than Himself. So we understand the Son Himself to be the life, when He said, <q>I am the way, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note151990"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> of whom also it was said, <q>He is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note151991"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:20</a></span> Supposing, then, that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> desired to see this equal divinity of the Son's with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, without any precognition of His coming in the flesh&mdash; as certain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> sought Him, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing of His flesh&mdash; can that other act of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, when he orders his servant to place his hand under his thigh, and to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of heaven, <span class="stiki" id="note151992"><a href="../bible/gen024.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;24:2-3</a></span> be rightly understood by any one otherwise than as showing that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the flesh in which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of heaven was to come was the offspring of that very thigh? </p>

<h2>Chapter 33 [XVIII.]&mdash; How Christ is Our Mediator.</h2>

<p>Of this flesh and blood <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a> also, when he blessed Abram himself, <span class="stiki" id="note151994"><a href="../bible/gen014.htm#verse18">Genesis&nbsp;14:18-20</a></span> gave the testimony which is very well known to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, so that long afterwards it was said to Christ in the Psalms: <q>You are a Priest for ever, after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>.</q>  This was not then an accomplished fact, but was still future; yet that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the fathers, which is the self-same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as our own, used to chant it. Now, to all who find death in Adam, Christ is of this avail, that He is the Mediator for life. He is, however, not a Mediator, because He is equal with the Father; for in this respect He is Himself as far distant from us as the Father; and how can there be any medium where the distance is the very same? Therefore the apostle does not say, <q>There is one Mediator between God and men, even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>;</q> but his words are, <q>The Man Christ Jesus.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note151996"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> He is the Mediator, then, in that He is man&mdash;inferior to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by so much as He is nearer to ourselves, and superior to us, by so much as He is nearer to the Father. This is more openly expressed thus: <q>He is inferior to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because in the form of a servant;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note151997"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> superior to us, because without spot of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34 [XXIX.]&mdash; No Man Ever Saved Save by Christ.</h2>

<p>Now, whoever maintains that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> at any period required not the second <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> for its physician, because it was not corrupted in the first Adam, is convicted as an enemy to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not in a question where <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> might be compatible with soundness of belief, but in that very rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which makes us <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. How happens it, then, that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which first <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, is praised by these men as being so far less tainted with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> manners? How is it that they overlook the fact that men were even then sunk in so many intolerable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that, with the exception of one man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his wife, and three sons and their wives, the whole world was in God's just judgment destroyed by the flood, even as the little land of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> was afterwards with fire?  From the moment, then, when <q>by one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in whom all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note151999"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> the entire mass of our nature was ruined beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and fell into the possession of its destroyer. And from him no one&mdash; no, not one&mdash; has been delivered, or is being delivered, or ever will be delivered, except by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Redeemer.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35 [XXX.]&mdash; Why the Circumcision of Infants Was Enjoined Under Pain of So Great a Punishment.</h2>

<p>The Scripture does not inform us whether before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> time righteous men or their children were marked by any bodily or visible sign.  <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> himself, indeed, received the sign of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, a seal of the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note152001"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;4:11</a></span> And he received it with this accompanying injunction: All the male infants of his household were from that very time to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, while fresh from their mother's womb, on the eighth day from their birth; <span class="stiki" id="note152002"><a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;17:10</a></span> so that even they who were not yet able with the heart to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> unto righteousness, should nevertheless receive the seal of the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And this command was imposed with so fearful a sanction, that God said: <q>That <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be cut off from his people, whose flesh of his foreskin is not <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> on the eighth day.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152003"><a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;17:14</a></span> If inquiry be made into the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of so terrible a penalty, will not the entire argument of these men about <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, and the laudable soundness and purity of nature, however cleverly maintained, fall to pieces, struck down and fractured to atoms? For, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> tell me, what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has an infant committed of his own will, that, for the negligence of another in not circumcising him, he himself must be condemned, and with so severe a condemnation, that that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must be cut off from his people? It was not of any temporal death that this <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> was inflicted, since of righteous <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, when they died, it used rather to be said, <q>And he was gathered unto his people;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152004"><a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;25:17</a></span> or, <q>He was gathered to his fathers:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152005"><a href="../bible/1ma002.htm#verse69">1&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;2:69</a></span> for no attempt to separate a man from his people is long formidable to him, when his own people is itself the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36 [XXXI]&mdash; The Platonists' Opinion About the Existence of the Soul Previous to the Body Rejected.</h2>

<p>What, then, is the purport of so severe a condemnation, when no wilful <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been committed? For it is not as certain Platonists have thought, because every such infant is thus requited in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for what it did of its own wilfulness previous to the present life, as having possessed previous to its present bodily state a free choice of living either well or ill; since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says most plainly, that before they were born they did neither good nor <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note152006"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;9:11</a></span> On what account, therefore, is an infant rightly punished with such ruin, if it be not because he belongs to the mass of perdition, and is properly regarded as born of Adam, condemned under the bond of the ancient debt unless he has been released from the bond, not according to debt, but according to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>? And what <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> but God's, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>? Now there was a forecast of His coming undoubtedly contained not only in other sacred institutions  of the ancient <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but also in their <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the foreskin. For the eighth day, in the recurrence of weeks, became the Lord's day, on which the Lord arose from the dead; and Christ was the rock <span class="stiki" id="note152008"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:4</a></span> whence was formed the stony blade for the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note152009"><a href="../bible/exo004.htm#verse25">Exodus&nbsp;4:25</a></span> and the flesh of the foreskin was the body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 37 [XXXII.]&mdash; In What Sense Christ is Called <q>Sin.</q></h2>

<p>There was a change of the sacramental ordinances made after the coming of Him whose advent they prefigured; but there was no change in the Mediator's help, who, even previous to His coming in the flesh, all along delivered the ancient members of His body by their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>; and in respect of ourselves too, though we were dead in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and in the uncircumcision of our flesh, we are quickened together in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in whom we are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> not made with the hand,  but such as was prefigured by the old manual <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, that the body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might be done away <span class="stiki" id="note152011"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;6:6</a></span> which was born with us from Adam. The propagation of a condemned origin condemns us, unless we are cleansed by the likeness of sinful flesh, in which He was sent without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, who nevertheless concerning <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> condemned <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, having been made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for us.  Accordingly the apostle says: <q>We beseech you in Christ's stead, be reconciled unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For He has made Him to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for us, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; that we might be made the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152013"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse20">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:20-21</a></span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, to whom we are reconciled, has made Him to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for us&mdash;that is to say, a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> by which our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be remitted; for by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are designated the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.

On whatever day, therefore, an infant may be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> after his birth, he is as if <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> on the eighth day; inasmuch as he is <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> in Him who rose again the third day indeed after He was crucified, but the eighth according to the weeks.

<p>But they argue thus, saying: <q>Is not, then, marriage an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and the man that is produced by marriage not God's work?</q> As if the good of the married life were that disease of concupiscence with which they who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not God <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their wives&mdash; a course which the apostle forbids; <span class="stiki" id="note152015"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:5</a></span> and not rather that conjugal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, by which carnal <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is reduced to the good purposes of the appointed procreation of children. Or as if, forsooth, a man could possibly be anything but God's work, not only when born in wedlock, but even if he be produced in fornication or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. In the present inquiry, however, when the question is not for what a Creator is necessary, but for what a Saviour, we have not to consider what good there is in the procreation of nature, but what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> there is in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereby our nature has been certainly corrupted. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the two are generated simultaneously&mdash; both nature and nature's corruption; one of which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The one comes to us from the bounty of the Creator, the other is contracted from the condemnation of our origin; the one has its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in the good-will of the Supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other in the depraved will of the first man; the one exhibits God as the maker of the creature, the other exhibits God as the punisher of disobedience: in short, the very same Christ was the <em>maker</em> of man for the creation of the one, and was <em> made</em> man for the healing of the other.</p>

<h2>Chapter 39 [XXXIV.]&mdash; Three Things Good and Laudable in Matrimony.</h2>

<p>Marriage, therefore, is a good in all the things which are proper to the married state. And these are three: it is the ordained means of procreation, it is the guarantee  of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, it is the bond of union.  In respect of its ordination for generation the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>I will therefore that the younger <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> marry, bear children, guide the house;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152019"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:14</a></span> as regards its guaranteeing <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, it is said of it, <q>The wife has not power of her own body, but the husband; and likewise also the husband has not power of his own body, but the wife;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152020"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:4</a></span> and considered as the bond of union: <q>What God has joined together, let not man put asunder.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152021"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;19:6</a></span> Touching these points, we do not forget that we have treated at sufficient length, with whatever ability the Lord has given us, in other works of ours, which are not unknown to you.  In relation to them all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has this general praise: <q>Marriage is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> in all, and the bed undefiled.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152023"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;13:4</a></span> For, inasmuch as the wedded state is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, insomuch does it produce a very large amount of good in respect of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of concupiscence; for it is not <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, but reason, which makes a good use of concupiscence. Now <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> lies in that law of the <q>disobedient</q> members which the apostle notes as <q>warring against the law of the mind;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152024"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;7:23</a></span> whereas reason lies in that law of the wedded state which makes good use of concupiscence. If, however, it were impossible for any good to arise out of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, God could not create man out of the embraces of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. As, therefore, the damnable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, whenever man is born in it, is not chargeable on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who certainly amidst man's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> work actually produces a good work; so, likewise, all which causes shame in that rebellion of the members which brought the accusing blush on those who after their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> covered these members with the fig-tree leaves, <span class="stiki" id="note152025"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;3:7</a></span> is not laid to the charge of marriage, by virtue of which the conjugal embrace is not only allowable, but is even useful and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>; but it is imputable to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of that disobedience which was followed by the penalty of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> finding his own members emulating against himself that very disobedience which he had practised against God. Then, abashed at their action, since they moved no more at the bidding of his rational will, but at their own arbitrary choice as it were, instigated by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, he devised the covering which should conceal such of them as he judged to be worthy of shame. For man, as the handiwork of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, deserved not confusion of face; nor were the members which it seemed fit to the Creator to form and appoint by any means designed to bring the blush to the creature. Accordingly, that simple nudity was displeasing neither to God nor to man: there was nothing to be ashamed of, because nothing at first accrued which deserved punishment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40 [XXXV.]&mdash; Marriage Existed Before Sin Was Committed. How God's Blessing Operated in Our First Parents.</h2>

<p>There was, however, undoubtedly marriage, even when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had no prior <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and for no other reason was it that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and not a second man, was created as a help for the man. Moreover, those words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>Be fruitful and multiply,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152026"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> are not prophetic of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to be condemned, but a benediction upon the fertility of marriage. For by these ineffable words of His, I mean by the divine methods which are inherent in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His wisdom by which all things were made, God endowed the primeval pair with their seminal power. Suppose, however, that nature had not been dishonoured by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, God forbid that we should think that marriages in Paradise must have been such, that in them the procreative members would be excited by the mere ardour of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and not by the command of the will for producing offspring&mdash;as the foot is for walking, the hand for labour, and the tongue for speech. Nor, as now happens, would the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> be corrupted to the conception of offspring by the force of a turbid heat, but it would rather be submissive to the power of the gentlest <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; and thus there would be no pain, no blood-effusion of the concumbent virgin, as there would also be no groan of the parturient mother. This, however, men refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, because it has not been verified in the actual condition of our mortal state. Nature, having been vitiated by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, has never experienced an instance of that primeval purity. But we speak to faithful men, who have learned to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the inspired Scriptures, even though no examples are adduced of actual reality. For how could I now possibly <em>prove</em> that a man was made of the dust, without any <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and a wife formed for him out of his own side? <span class="stiki" id="note152027"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;2:7,&nbsp;22</a></span> And yet <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> takes on trust what the eye no longer discovers.</p>

<h2>Chapter 41 [XXXVI.]&mdash; Lust and Travail Come from Sin. Whence Our Members Became a Cause of Shame.</h2>

<p>Granted, therefore, that we have no means of showing both that the nuptial acts of that primeval marriage were quietly discharged, undisturbed by lustful passion, and that the motion of the organs of generation, like that of any other members of the body, was not instigated by the ardour of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, but directed by the choice of the will (which would have continued such with marriage had not the disgrace of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> intervened); still, from all that is stated in the sacred Scriptures on divine authority, we have reasonable grounds for believing that such was the original condition of wedded life. Although, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, I am not told that the nuptial embrace was unattended with prurient desire; as also I do not find it on record that parturition was unaccompanied with groans and pain, or that actual birth led not to future death; yet, at the same time, if I follow the verity of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, the travail of the mother and the death of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> offspring would never have supervened if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had not preceded. Nor would that have happened which abashed the man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> when they covered their loins; because in the same sacred records it is expressly written that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was first committed, and then immediately followed this hiding of their shame. <span class="stiki" id="note152028"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;3:7</a></span> For unless some indelicacy of motion had announced to their eyes&mdash; which were of course not closed, though not open to this point, that is, not attentive&mdash; that those particular members should be corrected, they would not have perceived anything on their own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had entirely made worthy of all praise, that called for either shame or concealment. If, indeed, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had not first occurred which they had dared to commit in their disobedience, there would not have followed the disgrace which their shame would fain conceal.</p>

<h2>Chapter 42 [XXXVII.]&mdash; The Evil of Lust Ought Not to Be Ascribed to Marriage. The Three Good Results of the Nuptial Ordinance: Offspring, Chastity, and the Sacramental Union.</h2>

<p>It is then manifest that that must not be laid to the account of marriage, even in the absence of which, marriage would still have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. The good of marriage is not taken away by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, although the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is by marriage turned to a good use. Such, however, is the present condition of mortal men, that the connubial intercourse and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> are at the same time in action; and on this account it happens, that as the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is blamed, so also the nuptial commerce, however lawful and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, is thought to be reprehensible by those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who either are unwilling or unable to draw the distinction between them. They are, moreover, inattentive to that good of the nuptial state which is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of matrimony; I mean offspring, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and the pledge.  The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, however, at which even marriage blushes for shame is not the fault of marriage, but of the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh. Yet because without this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> it is impossible to effect the good purpose of marriage, even the procreation of children, whenever this process is approached, secrecy is sought, witnesses removed, and even the presence of the very children which happen to be born of the process is avoided as soon as they reach the age of observation. Thus it comes to pass that marriage is permitted to effect all that is lawful in its state, only it must not forget to conceal all that is improper. Hence it follows that infants, although incapable of sinning, are yet not born without the contagion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash;not, indeed, because of what is lawful, but on account of that which is unseemly: for from what is lawful nature is born; from what is unseemly, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Of the nature so born, God is the Author, who created man, and who united male and female under the nuptial law; but of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the author is the subtlety of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who deceives, and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the man who consents.</p>

<h2>Chapter 43 [XXXVIII.]&mdash; Human Offspring, Even Previous to Birth, Under Condemnation at the Very Root. Uses of Matrimony Undertaken for Mere Pleasure Not Without Venial Fault.</h2>

<p>Where God did nothing else than by a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> sentence to condemn the man who wilfully <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, together with his stock; there also, as a matter of course, whatsoever was even not yet born is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> condemned in its sinful root. In this condemned stock carnal generation holds every man; and from it nothing but spiritual regeneration liberates him. In the case, therefore, of regenerate parents,  if they continue in the same state of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it will undoubtedly work no injurious consequence, by reason of the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which has been bestowed upon them, unless they make a perverse use of it&mdash;not alone all kinds of lawless corruptions, but even in the marriage state itself, whenever husband and wife toil at procreation, not from the desire of natural propagation of their species, but are mere slaves to the gratification of their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> out of very wantonness. As for the permission which the apostle gives to husbands and wives, <q>not to defraud one another, except with consent for a time, that they may have leisure for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152030"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:5</a></span> he concedes it by way of indulgent allowance, and not as a command; but this very form of the concession evidently implies some degree of fault. The connubial embrace, however, which marriage-contracts point to as intended for the procreation of children, considered in itself simply, and without any reference to fornication, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and right; because, although it is by reason of this body of death (which is unrenewed as yet by the resurrection) impracticable without a certain amount of bestial motion, which puts <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to the blush, yet the embrace is not after all a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in itself, when reason applies the concupiscence to a good end, and is not overmastered to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 44 [XXXIX.]&mdash; Even the Children of the Regenerate Born in Sin. The Effect of Baptism.</h2>

<p>This concupiscence of the flesh would be prejudicial,  just in so far as it is present in us,  if the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were not so beneficial  that while it is present in men, both as born and as born again, it may in the former be prejudicial as well as present, but in the latter present simply but never prejudicial. In the unregenerate it is prejudicial to such an extent indeed, that, unless they are born again, no advantage can accrue to them from being born of regenerate <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. The fault of our nature remains in our offspring so deeply impressed as to make it guilty, even when the guilt of the self-same fault has been washed away in the parent by the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>&mdash; until every defect which ends in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the consent of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will is consumed and done away in the last regeneration. This will be identical with that renovation of the very flesh itself which is promised in its future resurrection, when we shall not only commit no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but be even free from those corrupt desires which lead us to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by yielding consent to them. To this blessed consummation advances are even now made by us, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> laver which we have put within our reach. The same regeneration which now renews our spirit, so that all our past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted, will by and by also operate, as might be expected, to the renewal to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life of that very flesh, by the resurrection of which to an incorruptible state the incentives of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> will be purged out of our nature. But this <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is as yet only accomplished in hope: it is not realized in fact; it is not in present possession, but it is looked forward to with patience. [XL.] And thus there is a whole and perfect cleansing, in the self-same baptismal laver, not only of all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> remitted now in our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which make us guilty owing to the consent we yield to wrong desires, and to the sinful acts in which they issue; but of these said wrong desires also, which, if not consented to by us, would contract no guilt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and which, though not in this present life removed, will yet have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in the life beyond.</p>

<h2>Chapter 45.&mdash; Man's Deliverance Suited to the Character of His Captivity.</h2>

<p>The guilt, therefore, of that corruption of which we are speaking will remain in the carnal offspring of the regenerate, until in them also it be washed away in the laver of regeneration. A regenerate man does not regenerate, but generates, sons according to the flesh; and thus he transmits to his posterity, not the condition of the regenerated, but only of the generated. Therefore, be a man guilty of unbelief, or a perfect believer, he does not in either case beget faithful children, but sinners; in the same way that the seeds, not only of a wild olive, but also of a cultivated one, produce not cultivated olives, but wild ones. So, likewise, his first birth holds a man in that bondage from which nothing but his second birth delivers him. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> holds him, Christ liberates him: Eve's deceiver holds him, Mary's Son frees him: he holds him, who approached the man through the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; He frees him, who was born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that never approached a man: he holds him, who injected into the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; He liberates him, who without any <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> was conceived in the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. The former was able to hold all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in his grasp through one; nor does any deliver them out of his power but One, whom he was unable to grasp. The very <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> indeed of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which she  administers with due ceremony, according to the authority of very ancient tradition (so that these men, notwithstanding their opinion that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are imitatively rather than really used in the case of infants, still do not venture to reject them with open disapproval)&mdash;the very <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, I say, of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church show plainly enough that infants, even when fresh from the womb, are delivered from the bondage of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For, to say nothing of the fact that they are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by no fallacious, but by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and faithful <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, there is previously wrought on them the exorcism and the exsufflation of the hostile power, which they profess to renounce by the mouth of those who bring them to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Now, by all these <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and evident signs of hidden realities, they are shown to pass from their worst oppressor to their most excellent Redeemer, who, by taking on Himself our infirmity in our behalf, has bound the strong man, that He may spoil his goods; <span class="stiki" id="note152035"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;12:29</a></span> seeing that the weakness of God is stronger, not only than men, but also than <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. While, therefore, God delivers small as well as great, He shows in both instances that the apostle spoke under the direction of the Truth. For it is not merely adults, but little babes too whom He rescues from the power of darkness, in order to transfer them to the kingdom of God's dear Son. <span class="stiki" id="note152036"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse13">Colossians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 46.&mdash; Difficulty of Believing Original Sin. Man's Vice is a Beast's Nature.</h2>

<p>No one should feel surprise, and ask: <q>Why does God's goodness create anything for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> malignity to take possession of?</q> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, God's gift is bestowed on the seminal elements of His creature with the same bounty wherewith <q>He makes His sun to rise on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152037"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> It is with so large a bounty that God has blessed the very seeds, and by blessing has constituted them. Nor has this blessing been eliminated out of our excellent nature by a fault which puts us under condemnation. Owing, indeed, to God's <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, who punishes, this fatal flaw has so far prevailed, that men are born with the fault of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but yet its influence has not extended so far as to stop the birth of men. Just so does it happen in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of adult age: whatever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they commit, do not eliminate his manhood from man; nay, God's work continues still good, however <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the impious. For although <q>man being placed in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> abides not; and being without understanding, is compared with the beasts, and is like them,</q>  yet the resemblance is not so absolute that he becomes a beast. There is a comparison, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, between the two; but it is not by reason of nature, but through <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>&mdash; not <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in the beast, but in nature. For so excellent is a man in comparison with a beast, that man's <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is beast's nature; still man's nature is never on this account changed into beast's nature. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, condemns man because of the fault wherewithal his nature is disgraced, and not because of his nature, which is not destroyed in consequence of its fault. <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> forbid that we should think beasts are obnoxious to the sentence of condemnation! It is only proper that they should be free from our misery, inasmuch as they cannot partake of our blessedness. What, then, is there surprising or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> in man's being subjected to an impure spirit&mdash; not on account of nature, but on account of that impurity of his which he has contracted in the stain of his birth, and which proceeds, not from the divine work, but from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of man&mdash;since also the impure spirit itself is a good thing considered as spirit, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in that it is impure? For the one is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is His work, while the other emanates from man's own will. The stronger nature, therefore, that is, the angelic one, keeps the lower, or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, nature in subjection, by reason of the association of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> with the latter. Accordingly the Mediator, who was stronger than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, became weak for man's sake. <span class="stiki" id="note152039"><a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:9</a></span> So that the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of the Destroyer is destroyed by the humility of the Redeemer; and he who makes his boast over the sons of men of his angelic strength, is vanquished by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness which He assumed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 47 [XLI.]&mdash; Sentences from Ambrose in Favour of Original Sin.</h2>

<p>And now that we are about to bring this book to a conclusion, we think it proper to do on this subject of <em> Original Sin</em> what we did before in our treatise <em>On Grace</em>, &mdash; adduce in evidence against the injurious talk of these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Archbishop Ambrose, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is proclaimed by Pelagius to be the most perfect among the writers of the Latin Church; for <em><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></em> is more especially honoured in doing away with <em>original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em>. In the work which the saintly Ambrose wrote, <em>Concerning the Resurrection</em>, he says: <q>I fell in Adam, in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was I expelled from Paradise, in Adam I died; and He does not recall me unless He has found me in Adam,&mdash; so as that, as I am obnoxious to the guilt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in him, and subject to death, I may be also justified in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q>  Then, again, writing against the Novatians, he says: <q>We men are all of us born in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; our very origin is in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; as you may read when David says, 'Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> did my mother conceive me.'  Hence it is that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> flesh is 'a body of death;' <span class="stiki" id="note152043"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24</a></span> even as he says himself, 'Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?' Christ's flesh, however, has condemned  <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which He experienced not by being born, and which by dying He crucified, that in our flesh there might be justification through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, where previously there was impurity through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q>  The same <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man also, in his <em> Exposition of Isaiah</em>, speaking of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, says: <q>Therefore as man He was tried in all things, and in the likeness of men He endured all things; but as born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, He was free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For every man is a liar, and no one but God alone is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. It is therefore an observed and settled fact, that no man born of a man and a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, that is, by means of their bodily union, is seen to be free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Whosoever, indeed, is free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is free also from a conception and birth of this kind.</q>  Moreover, when expounding the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Luke, he says: <q>It was no cohabitation with a husband which opened the secrets of the Virgin's womb; rather was it the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which infused immaculate seed into her unviolated womb. For the Lord Jesus alone of those who are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, inasmuch as He experienced not the contact of earthly corruption, by reason of the novelty of His immaculate birth; nay, He repelled it by His heavenly majesty.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 48.&mdash; Pelagius Rightly Condemned and Really Opposed by Ambrose.</h2>

<p>These words, however, of the man of God are contradicted by Pelagius, notwithstanding all his commendation of his author, when he himself declares that <q>we are procreated, as without <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so without <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.</q>  What remains, then, but that Pelagius should condemn and renounce this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of his; or else be sorry that he has quoted Ambrose in the way he has? Inasmuch, however, as the blessed Ambrose, catholic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as he is, has expressed himself in the above-quoted passages in accordance with the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it follows that Pelagius, along with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> C&oelig;lestius, was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> condemned by the authority of the catholic Church for having turned aside from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> way of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since he repented not for having bestowed commendation on Ambrose, and for having at the same time entertained opinions in opposition to him. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> full well with what insatiable avidity you  read whatever is written for edification and in confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but yet, notwithstanding its utility as contributing to such an end, I must at last bring this treatise to a conclusion.</p>
