<h1>On the Holy Spirit (Book I)</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The three books on the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are, as St. Ambrose says himself, a sequel to those on the Faith, and the two treatises together have been sometimes quoted as if one, with the title, <em>De Trinitate</em>. But we see from Gratian's letter to St. Ambrose, and from the reply, that each treatise is separate, and the <em>De Spiritu Sancto</em> was written some years later, a.d. 381.</p>

<p>In the first book St. Ambrose commences by allegorizing the history of Gideon and the fleece, seeing in the drying of the fleece and the moistening of the threshing-floor a type of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> leaving the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and being poured out on the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Passing to his more immediate subject, he proves that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is above the whole Creation and is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, alleging as a special argument that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> can never be forgiven, here or hereafter. He shows how the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is in Scripture called the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>; that He spoke by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; that He sanctifies men, and is typified by the mystical ointment spoken of in Scripture. Next, St. Ambrose treats of His oneness with the other two Persons of the Holy Trinity, and shows that His mission in no way detracts from this oneness, but that there is in all the Divine Persons a perfect unity of peace, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.</p>

<p>The second book commences with a treatment of the history of Samson in the same way as that of Gideon in Book I. Samson always succeeded so long as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was with him, but fell into misfortune so soon as he was forsaken. It is shown that the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is the same as that of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and that there is an agreement in design and working, and in vivifying man. He is Creator and therefore to be worshipped, and He worked with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> in founding the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in conclusion is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the unity of operation in the Three Persons.</p>

<p>The third book continues the same argument, showing that the mission of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and even of the Son Himself, is to be referred to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, yet without any subjection on the part of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, seeing that the Spirit also receives His mission from the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. The Godhead of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is next taken up and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, when occasion is taken also to show that there are not three Gods or three Lords, for the Three Divine Persons are one in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and nature; and the work is concluded with a summary of some of the principal arguments.</p>

<p>There can be but little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this is the work, and St. Ambrose the author, bitterly attacked by St. Jerome; the whole passage may be read in the <em>Apology</em> of Rufinus, p. 470, in vol. iii. of this series. St. Ambrose is compared to a daw decked in another bird's plumage, and charged with writing <q>bad things in Latin taken from <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in Greek,</q> and St. Jerome even took the trouble to translate a work of St. Didymus on the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> (from the preface to which the above extracts are taken), in order that those who did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Greek might, St. Jerome hoped, recognize the plagiarisms.</p>

<p>Rufinus vigorously defends St. Ambrose, and, pointing out many inconsistencies in his opponent, says: <q>The saintly Ambrose wrote his book on the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> not in words only but with his own blood, for he offered his life-blood to his persecutors, and shed it within himself, though God preserved his life for future labours.</q> </p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that St. Ambrose being a good Greek scholar, and having undertaken to write on the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, studied what others had written before him, and made use of what had been urged by SS. Basil, Didymus, and others. The opinion of the great St. Augustine concerning this treatise may be set against that of St. Jerome. <q>St. Ambrose when treating of the deep subject of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and showing that He is equal with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, yet makes use of a simple style of discourse; inasmuch as his subject required no the embellishments of language, but <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> to move the minds of his readers.</q> </p>

<h2>The book</h2>

<p> <em>To the <a href="../cathen/06729c.htm">Emperor Gratian</a>.</em></p>

<p>The choice of Gideon was a figure of our Lord's Incarnation, the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of a kid, of the satisfaction for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the body of Christ; that of the bullock, of the abolition of profane <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>; and in the three hundred soldiers was a type of the future redemption through the cross. The seeking of various signs by Gideon was also a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, for by the dryness and moistening of the fleece was signified the falling away of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the calling of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, by the water received in a basin the washing of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> feet. St. Ambrose <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that his own pollution may be washed away, and praises the loving-kindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The same water sent forth by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> effects marvellous conversions; it cannot, however, be sent by any other, since it is the pouring forth of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, Who is subject to no external power.</p>

<p>1. When Jerubbaal, as we read, was beating out wheat <span class="stiki" id="note340783"><a href="../bible/jdg006.htm#verse11">Judges&nbsp;6:11</a></span> under an oak, he received a message from God in order that he might bring the people of God from the power of strangers into liberty. Nor is it a matter of wonder if he was chosen for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, seeing that even then, being appointed under the shadow of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> cross and of the adorable Wisdom in the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the future Incarnation, he was bringing forth the visible grains of the fruitful grain from their hiding places, and was [<a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a>] separating the elect of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> from the refuse of the empty chaff. For these elect, as though trained with the rod of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, laying aside the superfluities of the old man together with his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, are gathered in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as in a winepress. For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the winepress of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> fountain, since from her wells forth the juice of the heavenly Vine.</p>

<p>2. And Gideon, moved by that message, when he heard that, though thousands of the people failed, God would deliver His own from their enemies by means of one man, <span class="stiki" id="note340784"><a href="../bible/jdg006.htm#verse14">Judges&nbsp;6:14</a></span> offered a kid, and according to the word of the Angel, laid its flesh and the unleavened cakes upon the rock, and poured the broth upon them. And as soon as the Angel touched them with the end of the staff which he bore, fire burst forth out of the rock, and so the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> which he was offering was consumed. <span class="stiki" id="note340785"><a href="../bible/jdg006.htm#verse19">Judges&nbsp;6:19-21</a></span> By which it seems clear that that rock was a figure of the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for it is written: <q>They drank of that rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340786"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:4</a></span> Which certainly refers not to His Godhead, but to His Flesh, which watered the hearts of the thirsting people with the perpetual stream of His Blood.</p>

<p>3. Even at that time was it declared in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> that the Lord Jesus in His Flesh would, when crucified, do away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the whole world, and not only the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the body, but the desires of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the flesh of the kid refers to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of deed, the broth to the enticements of desire as it is written: <q>For the people lusted an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340787"><a href="../bible/num011.htm#verse4">Numbers&nbsp;11:4</a></span> That the Angel then stretched forth his staff, and touched the rock, from which fire went out, <span class="stiki" id="note340788"><a href="../bible/jdg006.htm#verse21">Judges&nbsp;6:21</a></span> shows that the Flesh of the Lord, being filled with the Divine Spirit, would burn away all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty. Wherefore, also, the Lord says: <q>I have come to send fire upon the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340789"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;12:49</a></span> </p>

<p>4. Then the man, instructed and foreknowing what was to be, observes the heavenly <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and therefore, according to the warning, slew the bullock destined  by his father to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and himself offered to God another bullock seven years old. <span class="stiki" id="note340790"><a href="../bible/jdg006.htm#verse26">Judges&nbsp;6:26</a></span> By doing which he most plainly showed that after the coming of the Lord all Gentile <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> should be done away, and that only the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the Lord's passion should be offered for the redemption of the people. For that bullock was, in a type, Christ, in Whom, as Esaias said, dwelt the fullness of the seven gifts of the Spirit. <span class="stiki" id="note340791"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;11:2</a></span> This bullock <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> also offered when he saw the day of the Lord and was glad. <span class="stiki" id="note340792"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse56">John&nbsp;8:56</a></span> He it is Who was offered at one time in the type of a kid, at another in that of a sheep, at another in that of a bullock. Of a kid, because He is a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; of a sheep, because He is an unresisting victim; of a bullock, because He is a victim without blemish.</p>

<p>5. Holy Gideon then saw the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> beforehand. Next he chose out three hundred for the battle, so as to show that the world should be freed from the incursion of worse enemies, not by the multitude of their number, but by the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the cross. And yet, though he was brave and faithful, he asked of the Lord yet fuller <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of future victory, saying: <q>If You will save <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by mine hand, O Lord, as You have said, behold I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor, and if there shall be dew on the fleece and dryness on all the ground, I shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that You will deliver the people by my hand according to Your promise. And it was so.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340793"><a href="../bible/jdg006.htm#verse36">Judges&nbsp;6:36</a></span> Afterwards he asked in addition that dew should descend on all the earth and dryness be on the fleece.</p>

<p>6. Some one perhaps will enquire whether he does not seem to have been wanting in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, seeing that after being instructed by many signs he asked still more. But how can he seem to have asked as if doubting or wanting in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who was speaking in <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>? He was not then doubtful, but careful that we should not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. For how could he be doubtful whose <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was effectual? And how could he have begun the battle without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, unless he had understood the message of God? For the dew on the fleece signified the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, because the words of God come down like the dew.</p>

<p>7. So when the whole world was parched with the drought of Gentile <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, then came that dew of the heavenly visits on the fleece. But after that the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <span class="stiki" id="note340794"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;15:24</a></span> (whom I think that the figure of the Jewish fleece shadowed forth), after that those sheep, I say, <span class="stiki" id="note340795"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse13">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:13</a></span> <q>had refused the fountain of living water,</q> the dew of moistening <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> dried up in the breasts of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and that divine Fountain turned away its course to the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Whence it has come to pass that now the whole world is moistened with the dew of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have lost their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and counsellors.</p>

<p>8. Nor is it strange that they should suffer the drought of unbelief, whom the Lord deprived of the fertilising of the shower of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, saying: <q>I will command My clouds that they rain not upon that vineyard.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340796"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;5:6</a></span> For there is a health-giving shower of salutary <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as David also said: <q>He came down like rain upon a fleece, and like drops that drop upon the earth.</q>  The <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> promised us this rain upon the whole earth, to water the world with the dew of the Divine Spirit at the coming of the Saviour. The Lord, then, has now come, and the rain has come; the Lord has come bringing the heavenly drops with Him, and so now we drink, who before were thirsty, and with an interior draught drink in that Divine Spirit.</p>

<p>9. Holy Gideon, then, foresaw this, that the nations of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also would drink by the reception of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and therefore he enquired more diligently, for the caution of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is necessary. Insomuch that also Joshua the son of Nun, when he saw the captain of the heavenly host, enquired: <q>Are you for us, or for our adversaries?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340798"><a href="../bible/jos005.htm#verse13">Joshua&nbsp;5:13</a></span> lest, perchance, he might be deceived by some stratagem of the adversary.</p>

<p>10. Nor was it without a reason that he put the fleece neither in a field nor in a meadow, but in a threshing-floor, where is the harvest of the wheat: <q>For the harvest is plenteous, but the labourers are few;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340799"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse2">Luke&nbsp;10:2</a></span> because that, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, there was about to be a harvest fruitful in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.</p>

<p>11. Nor, again, was it without a reason that he dried the fleece of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and put the dew from it into a basin, so that it was filled with water, yet he did not himself wash his feet in that dew. The prerogative of so great a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> was to be given to another. He was being waited for Who alone could wash away the filth of all. Gideon was not great enough to claim this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> for himself, but <q>the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340800"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;20:28</a></span> Let us, then, recognize in Whom these <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> are seen to be accomplished. Not in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Gideon, for they were still at their commencement. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were surpassed, for dryness was still upon the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and therefore did <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> surpass them, for then did the dew remain on the fleece.</p>

<p>12. Let us come now to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I find the Lord stripping Himself of His garments, and girding Himself with a towel, pouring water into a basin, and washing the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples'</a> feet. <span class="stiki" id="note340801"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;13:4</a></span> That heavenly dew was this water, this was foretold, namely, that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> would wash the feet of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in that heavenly dew. And now let the feet of our minds be stretched out. The Lord Jesus wills also to wash our feet, for He says, not to Peter alone, but to each of the faithful: <q>If I wash not your feet you will have no part with Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340802"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse8">John&nbsp;13:8</a></span> </p>

<p>13. Come, then, Lord Jesus, put off Your garments, which You put on for my sake; be stripped that You may clothe us with Your mercy. Gird Yourself for our sakes with a towel, that You may gird us with Your gift of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. Pour water into the basin, wash not only our feet but also the head, and not only of the body, but also the footsteps of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. I wish to put off all the filth of our frailty, so that I also may say: <q>By night I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340803"><a href="../bible/son005.htm#verse3">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;5:3</a></span> </p>

<p>14. How great is that excellence! As a servant, You wash the feet of Your <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, You send dew from heaven. Nor do You wash the feet only, but also invitest us to sit down with You, and by the example of Your dignity dost exhort us, saying: <q>You call Me Master and Lord, and you do well, for so I am. If, then, I the Lord and Master have washed your feet, you ought also to wash one another's feet.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340804"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;13:13-14</a></span> </p>

<p>15. I, then, wish also myself to wash the feet of my brethren, I wish to fulfil the commandment of my Lord, I will not be ashamed in myself, nor disdain what He Himself did first. Good is the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of humility, because while washing the pollutions of others I wash away my own. But all were not able to exhaust this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was, indeed, willing to wash feet, <span class="stiki" id="note340805"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;18:4</a></span> but because of a feeling of hospitality. Gideon, too, was willing to wash the feet of the Angel of the Lord who appeared to him,  but his willingness was confined to one; he was willing as one who would do a service, not as one who would confer fellowship with himself. This is a great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. Lastly, the Lord said to Peter: <q>What I do you know not now, but shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> hereafter.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340807"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse7">John&nbsp;13:7</a></span> This, I say, is a divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which even they who wash will enquire into. It is not, then, the simple water of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> whereby we attain to be found worthy of having part with Christ.</p>

<p>16. There is also a certain water which we put into the basin of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, water from the fleece and from the Book of Judges; water, too, from the Book of Psalms.  It is the water of the message from heaven. Let, then, this water, O Lord Jesus, come into my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, into my flesh, that through the moisture of this rain  the valleys of our minds and the fields of our hearts may grow green. May the drops from You come upon me, shedding forth <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. Wash the steps of my mind that I may not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> again. Wash the heel  of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that I may be able to efface the curse, that I feel not the serpent's bite <span class="stiki" id="note340811"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse15">Genesis&nbsp;3:15</a></span> on the foot of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but, as You Yourself hast bidden those who follow You, may tread on serpents and scorpions <span class="stiki" id="note340812"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;10:19</a></span> with uninjured foot. You have redeemed the world, redeem the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a single sinner.</p>

<p>17. This is the special excellence of Your loving-kindness, wherewith You have redeemed the whole world one by one. Elijah was sent to one <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>;  Elisha cleansed one;  You, O Lord Jesus, have at this day cleansed a thousand. How many in the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, how many at Alexandria, how many at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, how many also at Constantinople! For even Constantinople has received the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and has received evident <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of Your judgment. For so long as she cherished the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians'</a> poison in her bosom, disquieted by neighbouring <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, she echoed with hostile arms around. But so soon as she rejected those who were alien from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> she received as a suppliant the enemy himself, the judge of kings, whom she had always been wont to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, she buried him when dead, and retains him entombed.  How many, then, have You cleansed at Constantinople, how many, lastly, at this day in the whole world!</p>

<p>18. Damasus cleansed not, Peter cleansed not, Ambrose cleansed not, Gregory cleansed not;  for ours is the ministry, but the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are Yours. For it is not in man's power to confer what is divine, but it is, O Lord, Your gift and that of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as You have spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, saying: <q>I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh, and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340817"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse28">Joel&nbsp;2:28</a></span> This is that typical dew from heaven, this is that gracious rain, as we read: <q>A gracious rain, dividing for His inheritance.</q>  For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not subject to any foreign power or law, but is the Arbiter of His own freedom, dividing all things according to the decision of His own will, to each, as we read, severally as He wills. <span class="stiki" id="note340819"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:11</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 1.</h2>

<p>St. Ambrose commences his argument by complimenting the Emperor, both for his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and for the restitution of the Basilica to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; then having urged that his opponents, if they affirm that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not a servant, cannot deny Him to be above all, adds that the same Spirit, when He said, <q>All things serve You,</q> showed plainly that He was distinct from creatures; which point he also establishes by other evidence.</p>

<p>19. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, then, is not among but above all things. For (since you, most merciful Emperor, are so fully instructed concerning the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> as to be able yourself to teach others) I will not detain you longer, as you desire and claim to be told something more exactly [concerning Him], especially since you lately showed yourself to be so pleased by an argument of this nature, as to command the Basilica to be restored to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without any one urging you.</p>

<p>20. So, then, we have received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the reward of our own; for we cannot say otherwise than that it was of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, that when all were unconscious of it, you suddenly restored the Basilica. This is the gift, I say, this the work of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, Who indeed was at that time preached by us, but was working in you.</p>

<p>21. And I do not regret the losses of the previous time, since the sequestration of that Basilica resulted in the gain of a sort of <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>. For you sequestrated the Basilica, that you might give <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And so your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> fulfilled its intention, which had sequestered that it might give <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, and so gave <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> as to restore. I did not lose the fruit, and I have your judgment, and it has been made clear to all that, with a certain diversity of action, there was in you no diversity of opinion. It was made clear, I say, to all, that it was not of yourself that you sequestrated, that it was of yourself when you restored it.</p>

<p>22. Now let us establish by evidence what we have said. The first point in the discussion is that all things serve. Now it is clear that all things serve, since it is written: <q>All things serve You.</q>  This the Spirit said through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. He did not say, We serve, but, <q>serve You,</q> that you might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He Himself is excepted from serving. So, then, since all things serve, and the Spirit does not serve, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is certainly not included among all things.</p>

<p>23. For if we say that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is included among all things, certainly when we read that the Spirit searches the deep things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note340821"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:10</a></span> we deny that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is over all. For since the Spirit is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is the Spirit of His mouth, how can we say that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is included among all things, seeing that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, is over all, possessing certainly fullness of perfection and perfect power.</p>

<p>25. But lest the objectors should think that the Apostle was in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, let them learn whom he followed as his authority for his belief. The Lord said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>When the Paraclete has come, Whom I will send to you from My Father, even the Spirit of Truth which proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He shall bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340822"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;15:26</a></span> So the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> both proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the Son. For the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> Who is both faithful and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, than which <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> nothing is more full for the expression of the Divine Majesty, nothing more clear as to the Unity of the Divine Power, since the Spirit has the same <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, Who is the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> and inseparable sharer of the Father's secrets.</p>

<p>26. He excludes, then, the fellowship and number of creatures from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by not excluding the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, He shows that He is not of the fellowship of creatures. So that the passage which is read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>For no man has seen God at any time, save the Only-begotten Son Who is in the bosom of the Father He has declared Him,</q> also pertains to the exclusion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For how has He not seen God Who searches even the deep things of God? How has He not seen God Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things which are of God? How has He not seen God Who is of God? So, since it is laid down that no one has seen God at any time, whereas the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> has seen Him, clearly the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is excepted. He, then, is above all Who is excluded from all.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p>The words, <q>All things were made by Him,</q> are not a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is included among all things, since He was not made. For otherwise it could be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by other passages that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and even the Father Himself, must be numbered among all things, which would be similar irreverence.</p>

<p>27. This seems, gracious Emperor, to be a full account of our right feeling, but to the impious it does not seem so. Observe what they are striving after. For the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are wont to say that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is to be reckoned among all things, because it is written of God the Son: <q>All things were made by Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340823"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> </p>

<p>28. How utterly confused is a course of argument which does not hold to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and is involved in an inverted order of statements. For this argument would be of value for the statement that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is among all things, if they <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that He was made. For <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says that all things which were made were made by the Son; but since we are not taught that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was made, He certainly cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be among all things Who was neither made as all things are, nor created. To me this testimony is of use for establishing each point; firstly, that He is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be above all things, because He was not made; and secondly, that because He is above all things, He is seen not to have been made, and is not to be numbered among those things which were made.</p>

<p>29. But if any one, because the Evangelist stated that all things were made by the Word, making no exception of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> (although the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> speaking in John said: <q>All things were made by Him,</q> and said not we were all things which were made; while the Lord Himself distinctly showed that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> spoke in the Evangelists, saying, <q>For it will not be you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaks in you</q>), <span class="stiki" id="note340824"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;10:20</a></span> yet if any one, as I said, does not except the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in this place, but numbers Him among all, he consequently does not except the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in that passage where the Apostle says: <q>Yet to us there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of Whom are all things, and we by Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340825"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:6</a></span> But that he may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Son is not among all things, let him read what follows, for when he says: <q>And one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by Whom are all things,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340826"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:6</a></span> he certainly excepts the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> from all, who also excepted the Father.</p>

<p>30. But it is equal irreverence to detract from the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For he believes not in the Father who does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, nor does he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> who does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, nor can <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> stand without the rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For he who has begun to deny the oneness of power in the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> certainly cannot prove his divided <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in points where there is no division. So, then, since complete <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> rightly, so complete impiety is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> wrongly.</p>

<p>31. Therefore they who think that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> ought to be numbered among all things, because they read that all things were made by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, must needs also think that the Son is to be numbered among all things, because they read: <q>All things are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340827"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:18</a></span> But, consequently, they also do not separate the Father from all things, who do not separate the Son from all creatures, since, as all things are of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, so, too, all things are by the Son. And the Apostle, because of his foresight in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, used this very expression, lest he should seem to the impious who had heard that the Son had said, <q>That which My Father has given Me is greater than all,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340828"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;10:29</a></span> to have included the Son among all.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p>The statement of the Apostle, that all things are of the Father by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, does not separate the Spirit from Their company, since what is referred to one Person is also attributed to each. So those <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Name of Christ are held to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Name of the Father and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, if, that is, there is belief in the Three Persons, otherwise the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> will be null. This also applies to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the Name of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. If because of one passage the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is separated from the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, it will necessarily follow from other passages that the Father will be subordinated to the Son. The Son is worshipped by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, not by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, for the latter is His <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, not His servant. Where the Son is spoken of as being before all, it is to be understood of creatures. The great dignity of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the absence of forgiveness for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against Him. How it is that such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be forgiven, and how the Spirit is one.</p>

<p>32. But perhaps some one may say that there was a reason why the writer said that all things were of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and all things through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note340829"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:6</a></span> but made no mention of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and would obtain the foundation of an argument from this. But if he persists in his perverse interpretation, in how many passages will he find the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> asserted, in which Scripture has stated nothing concerning either the Father or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but has left it to be understood?</p>

<p>40. Where, then, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit is asserted, is that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father or of the Only-begotten Son denied? By no means; for as the Father is in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Son in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, so, too, <q>the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, Who has been given us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340830"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> And as he who is <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in Christ is <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the Name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, because the Name is one and the Power one; so, too, when any divine operation, whether of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, is treated of, it is not referred only to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but also to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and not only to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but also to the Son and the Spirit.</p>

<p>41. Then, too, the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a> eunuch of Queen Candace, when <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, obtained the fullness of the sacrament. And they who said that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not of any <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, although they said that they had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> afterwards, because John <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the Name of the coming Jesus, not in his own. And so they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, because in the form in which John <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> they had not received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For John, though he did not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, nevertheless preached Christ and the Spirit. And then, when he was questioned whether he were perchance himself the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, he answered: <q>I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with water, but a stronger than I shall come, Whose shoes I am not worthy to bear, He shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and with fire.</q>  They therefore, because they had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> neither in the Name of Christ nor with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, could not receive the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<p>42. So they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>,  and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was not repeated in their case, but administered differently, for there is but one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. But where there is not the complete sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, there is not considered to be a commencement nor any kind of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is complete if one confess the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. If you deny One you overthrow the whole. And just as if you mention in words One only, either the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and in your belief do not deny either the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is complete, so, too, although you name the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and lessen the power of either the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the whole <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is made empty. And, lastly, they who had said: <q>We have not heard if there be any <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> afterwards in the Name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q>  And this was an additional abundance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for now through <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> preaching they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>43. Nor ought it to seem opposed to this, that although subsequently mention is not made of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, He is yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in, and what had not been mentioned in words is expressed in belief. For when it is said, <q>In the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>,</q> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is complete through the oneness of the Name, and the Spirit is not separated from the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since John <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> unto repentance, Christ in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>44. Let us now consider whether as we read that the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was complete, so, too, when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> alone is named, anything is wanting to the completeness of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. Let us follow out the argument that he who has named One has signified the Trinity. If you name Christ, you imply both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father by Whom the Son was anointed, and the Son Himself Who was anointed, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> with Whom He was anointed. For it is written: <q>This <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, Whom God anointed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340834"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse38">Acts&nbsp;10:38</a></span> And if you name the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, you denote equally His Son and the Spirit of His mouth, if, that is, you apprehend it in your heart. And if you speak of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, you name also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, from Whom the Spirit proceeds, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, inasmuch as He is also the Spirit of the Son.</p>

<p>45. Wherefore that authority may also be joined to reason Scripture indicates that we can also be rightly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, when the Lord says: <q>But you shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340835"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse5">Acts&nbsp;1:5</a></span> And in another place the Apostle says: <q>For we were all <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the body itself into one Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340836"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:13</a></span> The work is one, for the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is one; the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> one, for there was one death on behalf of the world; there is, then, a oneness of working, a oneness of setting forth, which cannot be separated.</p>

<p>46. But if in this place the Spirit be separated from the operation of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because it is said, All things are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and all things are through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note340837"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:6</a></span> then, too, when the Apostle says of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>Who is over all, God blessed for ever,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340838"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;9:5</a></span> He set Christ not only above all creatures, but (which it is impious to say) above the Father also. But God forbid, for the Father is not among all things, is not among a kind of crowd of His own creatures. The whole creation is below, over all is the Godhead of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. The former serves, the latter rules; the former is subject, the latter reigns; the former is the work, the latter the author of the work; the former, without exception, worships, the latter is worshipped by all without exception.</p>

<p>47. Lastly, of the Son it is written: <q>And let all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God worship Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340839"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;1:6</a></span> You do not find, Let the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> worship. And farther on: <q>To which of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said He at any time, Sit on My right hand till I make your enemies the footstool of your feet? Are they not all,</q> says he, <q>ministering spirits who are sent to minister?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340840"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;1:14</a></span> When he says <em>All</em>, does he include the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? Certainly not, because Angels and the other Powers are destined to serve in ministering and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<p>48. But in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not a minister but a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as the Son Himself said of Him: <q>He shall bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340841"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;15:26</a></span> The Spirit, then, is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the Son. He who is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. For so you read in later passages, for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was confirmed to us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> by signs and wonders and by manifold powers and by distributions of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note340842"><a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse3">Hebrews&nbsp;2:3-4</a></span> He who divides as he will is certainly above all, not among all, for to divide is the gift of the worker, not an innate part of the work itself.</p>

<p>49. If the Son is above all, through Whom our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> received its commencement, so that it might be preached, certainly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father also, Who testifies and gives confirmation concerning our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by signs and wonders, is excepted from all. In like manner the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, Who bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by His diversities of gifts, is not to be numbered with the crowd of creatures, but to be reckoned with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; Who, when He divides, is not Himself divided by cutting off Himself, for being indivisible He loses nothing when He gives to all, as also the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, when the Father receives the kingdom, <span class="stiki" id="note340843"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:24</a></span> loses nothing, nor does the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when He gives that which is His to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, suffer loss. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, then, by the testimony of the Son that there is no loss in the division of spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for He Who breathes where He wills <span class="stiki" id="note340844"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse8">John&nbsp;3:8</a></span> is everywhere free from loss. Concerning which power we shall speak more fully farther on.</p>

<p>50. In the meanwhile, since our intention is to prove in due order that the Spirit is not to be reckoned among all things, let us take the Apostle, whose words they call in question, as an authority for this position. For what <q>all things</q> would be, whether visible or invisible, he himself declared when he said: <q>For in Him were all things created in the heavens and in earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340845"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse16">Colossians&nbsp;1:16</a></span> You see that <q>all things</q> is spoken of things in the heavens, and of things in earth, for in the heavens are also invisible things which were made.</p>

<p>51. But that no one should be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this he added those of whom he was speaking: <q>Whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers, all things were created by Him and in Him, and He is before all, and in Him all things consist.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340846"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse16">Colossians&nbsp;1:16-17</a></span> Does he, then, include the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> here among creatures? Or when he says that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is before all things, is he to be supposed to have said that He is before the Father? Certainly not; for as here he says that all things were created by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and that all things in the heavens consist in Him, so, too, it cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that all things in the heavens have their strength in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, since we read: <q>By the word of the Lord were the heavens established and all the strength of them by the Spirit of His mouth.</q>  He, then, is above all, from Whom is all the strength of things in heaven and things on earth. He, then, Who is above all things certainly does not serve; He Who serves not is free; He Who is free has the prerogative of lordship.</p>

<p>52. If I were to say this at first it would be denied. But in the same manner as they deny the less that the greater may not be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, so let us set forth lesser matters first that either they may show their perfidy in lesser matters, or, if they grant the lesser matters, we may infer greater from the lesser.</p>

<p>53. I think, most merciful Emperor, that they are most fully confuted who dare to reckon the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> among all things. But that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are pressed not only by the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but also by that of our Lord; how can they dare to reckon the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> among all things, since the Lord Himself said: <q>He who shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, it shall be forgiven him; but he who shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall never be forgiven, either here or hereafter.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340848"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;12:32</a></span> How, then, can any one dare to reckon the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> among creatures? Or who will so blind himself as to think that if he have injured any creature he cannot be forgiven in any wise? For if the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> because they worshipped the <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">host</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> were deprived of divine protection, while he who worships and confesses the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is accepted of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but he who confesses Him not is convicted of sacrilege without forgiveness: certainly it follows from this that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> cannot be reckoned among all things, but that He is above all things, an offense against Whom is avenged by <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment.</p>

<p>54. But observe carefully why the Lord said: <q>He who shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> it shall be forgiven him, but he who shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall never be forgiven, either here or hereafter.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340849"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;12:32</a></span> Is an offense against the Son different from one against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? For as their dignity is one, and common to both, so too is the offense. But if any one, led astray by the visible <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, should think somewhat more remissly than is fitting concerning the Body of Christ (for it ought not to appear of little worth to us, seeing it is the palace of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and the fruit of the Virgin), he incurs guilt, but he is not shut out from pardon, which he may attain to by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But if any one should deny the dignity, majesty, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and should think that devils are cast out not in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, there can be no attaining of pardon there where is the fullness of sacrilege; for he who has denied the Spirit has denied also the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, since the same is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> Who is the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is one and the same Who spoke in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, Who is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> and of Christ; Whom, further, Scripture designates the Paraclete, and the Spirit of life and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>55. But no one will <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the Spirit is one, although very many have <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether God be one. For many <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have said that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> is one, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is another. But as the Father is one Who both spoke of old, as we read, to the fathers by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and to us in the last days by His Son; <span class="stiki" id="note340850"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse1">Hebrews&nbsp;1:1-2</a></span> and as the Son is one, Who according to the tenour of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> was offended by Adam, <span class="stiki" id="note340851"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;3:17</a></span> seen by <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note340852"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse22">Genesis&nbsp;18:22-23</a></span> worshipped by Jacob; <span class="stiki" id="note340853"><a href="../bible/gen028.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;28:17</a></span> so, too, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is one, who energized in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note340854"><a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse21">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:21</a></span> was breathed upon the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note340855"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;20:22</a></span> and was joined to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> in the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note340856"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> For David says of Him: <q>And take not Your <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from me.</q>  And in another place he said of Him: <q>Whither shall I go from Your Spirit?</q> </p>

<p>56. That you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> is the same as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as we read also in the Apostle: <q>No one speaking in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of God says Anathema to Jesus and no one can say, Lord Jesus, but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340859"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:3</a></span> the Apostle calls Him the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. He called Him also the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as you read: <q>But you are not in the flesh but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, if so be that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwells in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340860"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;8:9</a></span> And farther on: <q>But if the Spirit of Him Who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340861"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;8:11</a></span> The same is, then, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, Who is the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>57. The same is also the Spirit of Life, as the Apostle says: <q>For the law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus has delivered me from the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340862"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;8:2</a></span> </p>

<p>58. Him, then, Whom the Apostle called the Spirit of Life, the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> named the Paraclete, and the Spirit of Truth, as you find: <q>And I will ask the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and He will give you another Comforter [Paraclete], that He may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth, Whom this world cannot receive; because it sees Him not, neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340863"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;14:16-17</a></span> You have, then, the Paraclete Spirit, called also the Spirit of Truth, and the invisible Spirit. How, then, do some think that the Son is visible in His Divine Nature, when the world cannot see even the Spirit?</p>

<p>59. Receive now the saying of the Lord, that the same is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> Who is the Spirit of Truth, for you read in the end of this book: <q>Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340864"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;20:22</a></span> And Peter teaches that the same is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> Who is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a>, when he says: <q>Ananias, why has it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to you to tempt and to lie to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340865"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse3">Acts&nbsp;5:3</a></span> And immediately after he says again to the wife of Ananias: <q>Why has it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to you to tempt the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340866"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse9">Acts&nbsp;5:9</a></span> When he says <q>to you,</q> he shows that he is speaking of the same Spirit of Whom he had spoken to Ananias. He Himself is, then, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> Who is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>60. And the Lord Himself made clear that the same Who is the Spirit of the Father is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, when according to Matthew He said that we ought not to take thought in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> what we should say: <q>For it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaks in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340867"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;10:20</a></span> Again He says according to St. Luke: <q>Be not anxious how you shall answer or speak, for the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of God shall teach you in that hour what you ought to say.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340868"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;12:11-12</a></span> So, although many are called spirits, as it is said: <q>Who makes His Angels spirits,</q> yet the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> is but one.</p>

<p>61. Both <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> received that one Spirit, as the vessel of election, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Doctor of the Gentiles</a>, says: <q>For we have all drunk of one Spirit;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340869"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:13</a></span> Him, as it were, Who cannot be divided, but is poured into <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and flows into the senses, that He may quench the burning of this world's thirst.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, since He sanctifies creatures, is neither a creature nor subject to change. He is always good, since He is given by the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; neither is He to be numbered among such things as are said to fail. He must be acknowledged as the source of goodness. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>'s mouth, the amender of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and Himself good. Lastly, as He is said in Scripture to be good, and is joined to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, He cannot possibly be denied to be good. He is not, however, said to progress, but to be made perfect in goodness, which distinguishes Him from all creatures.</p>

<p>62. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not, then, of the substance of things corporeal, for He sheds incorporeal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on corporeal things; nor, again, is He of the substance of invisible creatures, for they receive His sanctification, and through Him are superior to the other works of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Whether you speak of Angels, or Dominions, or Powers, every creature waits for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For as we are children through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, because <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts crying, Abba, Father; so that you are now not a servant but a son;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340870"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;4:6-7</a></span> in like manner, also, every creature is waiting for the revelation of the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> made sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore, also, every creature itself shall be changed by the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, <q>and shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>

<p>63. Every creature, then, is subject to change, not only such as has been changed by some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or condition of the outward elements, but also such as can be liable to corruption by a fault of nature, though by careful discipline it be not yet so; for, as we have shown in a former treatise,  the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Angels evidently can be changed. It is certainly fitting to judge that such as is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of one, such also is that of others. The nature of the rest, then, is capable of change, but the discipline is better.</p>

<p>64. Every creature, therefore, is capable of change, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and not capable of change, nor can He be changed by any fault, Who does away the faults of all and pardons their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. How, then, is He capable of change, Who by sanctifying works in others a change to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but is not changed Himself.</p>

<p>65. How is He capable of change Who is always good? For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, through Whom the things that are good are ministered to us, is never <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Whence two <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> in one and the same place, in words in differing from each other, have made the same statement, for you read in Matthew: <q>If you, being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to give good gifts to your children; how much more shall your Father, Who is in heaven, give <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to them that ask Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340873"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;7:11</a></span> But according to Luke you will find it thus written: <q>How much more shall your heavenly Father give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to them that ask Him?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340874"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;11:13</a></span> We observe, then, that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in the Lord's judgment by the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, since the one has put <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in the place of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the other has named the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in the place of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. If, then, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, how is He not good?</p>

<p>66. Nor does it escape our notice that some copies have likewise, according to St. Luke: <q>How much more shall your heavenly Father give a good gift to them that ask Him.</q> This good gift is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which the Lord Jesus shed forth from heaven, after having been fixed to the gibbet of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, returning with the triumphal spoils of death deprived of its power, as you find it written: <q>Ascending up on high He led captivity captive, and gave good gifts to men.</q>  And well does he say <q>gifts,</q> for as the Son was given, of Whom it is written: <q>Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340876"><a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;9:6</a></span> so, too, is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit given. But why should I hesitate to say that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also is given to us, since it is written: <q>The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed forth in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, Who is given to us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340877"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> And since captive breasts certainly could not receive Him, the Lord Jesus first led captivity captive, that our affections being set free, He might pour forth the gift of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>.</p>

<p>67. And He said well <q>led captivity captive.</q> For the victory of Christ is the victory of liberty, which won <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for all, and inflicted wrong on none. So in the setting free of all no one is captive. And because in the time of the Lord's passion wrong alone had no part, which had made captive all of whom it had gained possession, captivity itself turning back upon itself was made captive, not now attached to <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a> but to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to serve Whom is liberty. <q>For he who is called in the Lord as a servant is the Lord's freedman.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340878"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:22</a></span> </p>

<p>68. But to return to the point. <q>All,</q> says He, <q>have gone aside, all together have become unprofitable. There is none that does good, not even one.</q>  If they except the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, even they themselves confess that He is not among all; if they do not except Him, then they, too, acknowledge that He has gone aside among all.</p>

<p>69. But let us consider whether He has goodness in Himself, since He is the Source and Principle of goodness. For as the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> have, so too the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also has goodness. And the Apostle also taught this when he said: <q>Now the fruit of the Spirit is peace, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, patience, goodness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340880"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians&nbsp;5:22</a></span> For who doubts that He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> Whose fruit is goodness. For <q>a good tree brings forth good fruit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340881"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;7:17</a></span> </p>

<p>70. And so if God be good, how shall He Who is the Spirit of His mouth not be good, Who searches even the deep things of God? Can the infection of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> enter into the deep things of God? And from this it is seen how foolish they are who deny that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, when they cannot deny that the Spirit of Christ is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, of Whom the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> says: <q>Therefore said I that He shall receive of Mine.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340882"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;16:15</a></span> </p>

<p>71. Or is the Spirit not good, Who of the worst makes good men, does away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, destroys <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, shuts out crime, pours in good gifts, makes <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of persecutors, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of sinners? <q>You were,</q> it is said, <q>sometime darkness, but now are you light in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340883"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> </p>

<p>72. But why do we put them off? And if they ask for statements since they do not deny facts, let them hear that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for David said: <q>Let Your good Spirit lead me forth in the right way.</q>  For what is the Spirit but full of goodness? Who though because of His nature He cannot be attained to, yet because of His goodness can be received by us, filling all things His power, but only partaken of by the just, simple in substance, rich in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, present to each, dividing of His own to every one, and Himself whole everywhere.</p>

<p>73. And with good <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> did the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> say: <q>Go and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> all nations in the Name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340885"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> not disdaining association with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Why, then, do some take it ill that He Whom the Lord disdained not in the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, should be joined in our devotion with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>?</p>

<p>74. Good, then, is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but good, not as though acquiring but as imparting goodness. For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> does not receive from creatures but is received; as also He is not sanctified but sanctifies; for the creature is sanctified, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> sanctifies. In which matter, though the word is used in common, there is a difference in the nature. For both the man who receives and God Who gives <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> are called <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, as we read: <q>Be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, for I am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340886"><a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse2">Leviticus&nbsp;19:2</a></span> Now sanctification and corruption cannot share the same nature, and therefore the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and the creature cannot be of one substance.</p>

<p>75. Since, then, the whole invisible creation (whose substance some rightly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be reasonable and incorporeal), with the exception of the Trinity, does not impart but acquires the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and does not share in it but receives it, the whole commonalty of creation is to be separated from association with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Let them then <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not a creature; or, if they think Him a creature, why do they associate Him with the Father? If they think Him a creature, why do they join Him with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? But if they do not think that He should be separated from the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, they do not consider Him to be a creature, for where the sanctification is one the nature is one.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.</h2>

<p>Although we are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the latter is much superior to the former, and is not therefore to be separated from the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</p>

<p>76. There are, however, many who, because we are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, think that there is no difference in the offices of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and therefore think that they do not differ in nature. Nor do they observe that we are buried in the element of water that we may rise again renewed by the Spirit. For in the water is the representation of death, in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is the pledge of life, that the body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may die through the water, which encloses the body as it were in a kind of tomb, that we, by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, may be renewed from the death of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, being born again in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>77. And so these three witnesses are one, as John said: <q>The water, the blood, and the Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340887"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:8</a></span> One in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, not in nature. The water, then, is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of burial, the blood is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of death, the Spirit is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of life. If, then, there be any <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the water, it is not from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of water, but from the presence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>78. Do we live in the water or in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>? Are we sealed in the water or in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>. For in Him we live and He Himself is the earnest of our inheritance, as the Apostle says, writing to the Ephesians: <q>In Whom believing you were sealed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of promise, Who is an earnest of our inheritance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340888"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;1:13-14</a></span> So we were sealed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, not by nature, but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it is written: <q>He Who anointed us is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who also sealed us, and gave the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</q></p>

<p>79. We were then sealed with the Spirit by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For as we die in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in order to be born again, so, too, we are sealed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, that we may possess His brightness and image and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is undoubtedly our spiritual seal. For although we were visibly sealed in our bodies, we are in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> sealed in our hearts, that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> may portray in us the likeness of the heavenly image.</p>

<p>80. Who, then, can dare to say that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is separated from the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, since through Him we attain to the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and through Him, as the Apostle Peter says, are partakers of the divine nature? In which there is certainly not the inheritance of carnal succession, but the spiritual connection of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of adoption. And in order that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this seal is rather on our hearts than on our bodies, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says: <q>The light of Your countenance has been impressed upon us, O Lord, You have put <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> in my heart.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 7.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not a creature, seeing that He is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, and was shed upon the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> dispersed through all countries, and moreover sanctifies the Angels also, to whom He makes us equal. Mary was full of the same likewise, so too, Christ the Lord, and so far all things high and low. And all benediction has its origin from His operation, as was signified in the moving of the water at Bethesda.</p>

<p>81. Since then, every creature is confined within certain limits of its own nature, and inasmuch as those invisible operations, which cannot be circumscribed by place and bounds, yet are closed in by the property of their own substance; how can any one dare to call the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> a creature, Who has not a limited and circumscribed power? Because He is always in all things and everywhere, which assuredly is the property of Divinity and Lordship, for: <q>The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.</q> </p>

<p>81. And so, when the Lord appointed His servants the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that we might recognize that the creature was one thing and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit another, He appointed them to different places, because all could not be everywhere at once. But He gave the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to all, to shed upon the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> though separated the gift of indivisible <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, then, were different, but the accomplishment of the working was in all one, because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is one of Whom it is said: <q>You shall receive power, even the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> coming upon you, and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem and in all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and unto the ends of the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340891"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse8">Acts&nbsp;1:8</a></span> </p>

<p>82. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, then, is uncircumscribed and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, Who infused Himself into the minds of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> throughout the separate divisions of distant regions, and the remote bounds of the whole world, Whom nothing is able to escape or to deceive. And therefore <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David says: <q>Whither shall I go from Your Spirit, or whither shall I flee from Your face.</q>  Of what Angel does the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> say this? Of what Dominion? Of what Power? Of what Angel do we find the power diffused over many? For Angels were sent to few, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was poured upon whole peoples. Who, then, can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that that is divine which is shed upon many at once and is not seen; but that that is corporeal which is seen and held by individuals?</p>

<p>83. But in like manner as the Spirit sanctifying the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> is not a partaker of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; so, too, He sanctifying Angels, Dominions, and Powers, has no partnership with creatures. But if any think that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the Angels is not spiritual, but some other kind of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> belonging to the property of their nature, they will forsooth judge Angels to be inferior to men. For since themselves also confess that they would not dare to compare Angels to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and they cannot deny that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is shed upon men; but the sanctification of the Spirit is a divine gift and favour, men who possess a better kind of sanctification will certainly be found to be preferred to the Angels. But since Angels come down to men to assist them, it must be understood that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Angels is higher as it receives more of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and that the favour awarded to us and to them comes from the same author.</p>

<p>84. But how great is that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which makes even the lower nature of the lot of men equal to the gifts received by Angels, as the Lord Himself promised, saying: <q>You shall be as the Angels in heaven.</q> Nor is it difficult, for He Who made those Angels in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> will by the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> make men also equal to the Angels.</p>

<p>85. But of what creature can it be said that it fills all things, as is written of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>: <q>I will pour My Spirit upon all flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340893"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse28">Joel&nbsp;2:28</a></span> This cannot be said of an Angel. Lastly, Gabriel himself, when sent to Mary, said: <q>Hail, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340894"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;1:28</a></span> plainly declaring the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit which was in her, because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> had come upon her, and she was about to have her womb full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> with the heavenly Word.</p>

<p>86. For it is of the Lord to fill all things, Who says: <q>I fill heaven and earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340895"><a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse24">Jeremiah&nbsp;23:24</a></span> If, then, it is the Lord Who fills heaven and earth, Who can judge the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to be without a share in the dominion and divine power, seeing that He has filled the world, and what is beyond the whole world, filled Jesus the Redeemer of the whole world? For it is written: <q>But Jesus, full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, departed from Jordan.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340896"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;4:1</a></span> Who, then, except one who possessed the same fullness could fill Him Who fills all things?</p>

<p>87. But lest they should object that this was said according to the flesh, though He alone from Whose flesh went forth <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to heal all, was more than all; yet, as the Lord fills all things, so, too, we read of the Spirit: <q>For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> filled the whole world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340897"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse7">Wisdom&nbsp;1:7</a></span> And you find it said of all who had consorted with the Apostles that, <q>filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> they spoke the word of God with boldness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340898"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse31">Acts&nbsp;4:31</a></span> You see that the Spirit gives both fullness and boldness, Whose operation the archangel announces to Mary, saying: <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> shall come on you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340899"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;1:35</a></span> </p>

<p>88. You read, too, in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that the Angel descended at the appointed time into the pool and troubled the water, and he who first went down into the pool was made whole. <span class="stiki" id="note340900"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;5:4</a></span> What did the Angel declare in this type but the descent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which was to come to pass in our day, and should consecrate the waters when invoked by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>? That Angel, then, was a herald of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, inasmuch as by means of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit medicine was to be applied to our infirmities of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and mind. The Spirit, then, has the same ministers as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and Christ. He fills all things, possesses all things, works all and in all in the same manner as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> work.</p>

<p>89. What, then, is more divine than the working of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, since God Himself testifies that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> presides over His blessings, saying: <q>I will put My Spirit upon your seed and My blessings upon your children.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340901"><a href="../bible/isa044.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;44:3</a></span> For no blessing can be full except through the inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Wherefore, too, the Apostle found nothing better to wish us than this, as He himself said: <q>We cease not to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and make request for you that you may be filled with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding walking worthily of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340902"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse9">Colossians&nbsp;1:9</a></span> He taught, then, that this was the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that rather by walking in good works and words and affections, we should be filled with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who puts His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in our hearts. Therefore if he who has the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is filled with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there is certainly no difference of will between the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, yet not wholly to each person, since there is no one besides Christ capable of receiving Him wholly. Charity is shed abroad by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, Who, prefigured by the mystical ointment, is shown to have nothing common with creatures; and He, inasmuch as He is said to proceed from the mouth of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must not be classed with creatures, nor with things divisible, seeing He is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>

<p>90. Observe at the same time that God gives the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For this is no work of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor gift of man; but He Who is invoked by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherein is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. For if the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> judged that he was not able to give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> himself by his own authority, and considered himself so far unequal to this office that he wished us to be filled by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note340903"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse18">Ephesians&nbsp;5:18</a></span> who is sufficient to dare to arrogate to himself the conferring of this gift? So the Apostle uttered this wish in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and did not claim a right by any authority of his own; he desired to obtain, he did not presume to command. Peter, too, says that he is not capable of compelling or restraining the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For he spoke thus: <q>Wherefore if God has granted them the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as to us, who was I that I could resist God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340904"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse17">Acts&nbsp;11:17</a></span> </p>

<p>91. But perchance they would not be moved by the example of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and so let us use divine utterances; for it is written: <q>Jacob is My servant, I will uphold him; <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is My elect, My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has upheld him, I put My Spirit upon him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340905"><a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;42:1</a></span> The Lord also said by Isaiah: <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is upon Me, because He has anointed Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340906"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;61:1</a></span> </p>

<p>92. Who, then, can dare to say that the substance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is created, at Whose shining in our hearts we behold the beauty of divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the distance between the creature and the Godhead, that the work may be distinguished from its Author? Or of what creature has God so spoken as to say: <q>I will pour out of My Spirit</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note340907"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse28">Joel&nbsp;2:28</a></span> He said not Spirit, but <q>of My Spirit,</q> for we are not able to receive the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but we receive as much as our Master divides to us of His own according to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note340908"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;2:6</a></span> For as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> that He should be equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but emptied Himself, that we might be able to receive Him in our minds; but He emptied Himself not that He was void of His own fullness, but in order that He, Whose fullness I could not endure, might infuse Himself into me according to the measure of my capacity, in like manner also the Father says that He pours out of the Spirit upon all flesh; for He did not pour Him forth wholly, but that which He poured forth abounded for all.</p>

<p>93. There was therefore a pouring out upon us of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but upon the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, when He was in the form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the Spirit abode, as it is written: <q>Upon Whom you shall see the Spirit descending from heaven, and abiding upon Him, He it is Who baptizes in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340909"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;1:33</a></span> Around us is the liberality of the Giver in abundant provision, in Him abides for ever the fullness of the Spirit. He shed forth then what He deemed to be sufficient for us, and what was shed forth is not separated nor divided; but He has a unity of fullness wherewith He may enlighten the sight of our hearts according to what our strength is capable of. Lastly, we receive so much as the advancing of our mind acquires, for the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit is indivisible, but is shared in by us according to the capacity of our own nature.</p>

<p>94. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, sheds forth of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is also shed abroad through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; in which point we ought to recognize the unity of the operation and of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For as God shed forth of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, so also <q>the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340910"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> in order that we may understand that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not a work, Who is the dispenser and plenteous Fount of the divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p>95. In like manner that you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that that which is shed abroad cannot be common to the creatures but peculiar to the Godhead, the name of the Son is also poured forth, as you read: <q>Your Name is as ointment poured forth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340911"><a href="../bible/son001.htm#verse3">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;1:3</a></span> Of which saying nothing can surpass the force. For as ointment closed up in a vase keeps in its perfume, so long as it is confined in the narrow space of that vase, though it cannot reach many, it yet preserves its strength. But when the ointment has been poured out of that vase wherein it was enclosed, it spreads far and wide; so, too, the Name of Christ before His coming among the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was enclosed in the minds of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as in some vase. For <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in Judah, His Name is great in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>;</q>  that is, the Name which the vases of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> held confined in their narrow limits.</p>

<p>96. Even then that Name was indeed great, when it remained in the narrow limits of the weak and few, but it had not yet poured forth its greatness throughout the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and to the ends of the whole world. But after that He by His coming had shone throughout the whole world, He spread abroad that divine Name of His throughout all creatures, not filled up by any addition (for fullness admits not of increase), but filling up the empty spaces, that His Name might be wonderful in all the world. The pouring forth, then, of His Name signifies a kind of abundant exuberance of graces and copiousness of heavenly goods, for whatever is poured forth flows over from abundance.</p>

<p>97. So as wisdom which proceeds from the mouth of God cannot be said to be created, nor the Word Which is uttered from His heart, nor the power in which is the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Majesty; so, too, the Spirit which is poured forth from the mouth of God cannot be considered to be created, since God Himself has shown their unity to be such that He speaks of His pouring forth of His Spirit. By which we understand that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is the same as that of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and that without any division or loss it is divided to the hearts of each. That, then, which is shed abroad of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is neither severed, nor comprehended in any corporeal parts, nor divided.</p>

<p>98. For how can it be credible that the Spirit should be divided by any parcelling out? John says of God: <q>Hereby <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> we that He abides in us by the Spirit which He has given us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340913"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:24</a></span> But that which abides always is certainly not changed, therefore if it suffers no change it is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. And so the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, but the creature is liable to fault, and therefore subject to change. But that which is subject to change cannot be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and there cannot therefore be anything in common between the Spirit and the creature, because the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, but every creature is temporal.</p>

<p>99. But the Apostle also shows that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, for: <q>If the blood of bulls and of goats, and the sprinkling the ashes of an heifer sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh, how much more the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who through the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Spirit offered Himself without spot to God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340914"><a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse13">Hebrews&nbsp;9:13-14</a></span> Therefore the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is rightly called the ointment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>; and why Christ Himself is not the ointment, since He was anointed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. It is not strange that the Spirit should be called Ointment, since the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are also called Spirit. And there is no confusion between them, since Christ alone suffered death, Whose saving cross is then spoken of.</p>

<p>100. Now many have thought that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is the ointment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And well it is said ointment, because He is called the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, the joining together of many graces giving a sweet fragrance. But God the Almighty Father anointed Him the Prince of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Who was, not like others anointed in a type under the Law, but was both according to the Law anointed in the body, and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was full with the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from the Father above the Law.</p>

<p>101. This is the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, of which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above Your fellows.</q>  Lastly, Peter says that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was anointed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as you read: <q>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that word which went through all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> beginning from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> after the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which John preached, even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, how God anointed Him with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340916"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse37">Acts&nbsp;10:37-38</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is, then, the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>.</p>

<p>102. And well did he say oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, lest you should think Him a creature; for it is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of this sort of oil that it will by no means mingle with moisture of another kind. Gladness, too, does not anoint the body, but brightens the inmost heart, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: <q>You have put <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> in my heart.</q>  So as he loses his pains who wishes to mix oil with moister matter, because since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of oil is lighter than others, when the others settle, it rises and is separated. How do those wretched pedlars think that the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> can by their tricks be mingled with other creatures, since of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> corporeal things cannot be mingled with in corporeal, nor things created with uncreated?</p>

<p>102. And well is that called oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> wherewith Christ was anointed; for neither was usual nor common oil to be sought for Him, wherewith either wounds are dressed or heat assuaged; since the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the world did not seek alleviation for His wounds, nor the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> might of His wearied Body demand refreshment.</p>

<p>103. Nor is it wonderful if He have the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, Who made those about to die <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, put off sadness from the world, destroyed the odour of sorrowful death. And so the Apostle says: <q>For we are the good odour of Christ to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340918"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> certainly showing that he is speaking of spiritual things. But when the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Himself says: <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is upon Me, because He has anointed Me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340919"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;4:18</a></span> He points out the ointment of the Spirit. Therefore the Spirit is the ointment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>104. Or since the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Name of Jesus</a> is as ointment poured out, if they wish to understand Christ Himself, and not the Spirit of Christ to be expressed under the name of ointment, certainly when the Apostle Peter says that the Lord Jesus was anointed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, it is without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> plain that the Spirit also is called ointment.</p>

<p>105. But what wonder, since both the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are said to be Spirit. Of which we shall speak more fully when we begin to speak of the Unity of the Name. Yet since most suitable place occurs here, that we may not seem to have passed on without a conclusion, let them read that both the Father is called Spirit, as the Lord said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>for God is Spirit;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340920"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;4:24</a></span> and Christ is called Spirit, for Jeremiah said: <q>The Spirit before our face, Christ the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340921"><a href="../bible/lam004.htm#verse20">Lamentations&nbsp;4:20</a></span> </p>

<p>106. So, then, both the Father is Spirit and Christ is Spirit, for that which is not a created body is spirit, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not commingled with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but is distinct from the Father and from the Son. For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> did not die, Who could not die because He had not taken flesh upon Him, and the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Godhead was incapable of dying, but Christ died according to the flesh.</p>

<p>107. For of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> He died in that which He took of the Virgin, not in that which He had of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for Christ died in that nature in which He was crucified. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> could not be crucified, Who had not flesh and bones, but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was crucified, Who took flesh and bones, that on that cross the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of our flesh might die. For He took on Him that which He was not that He might hide that which He was; He hid that which He was that He might be tempted in it, and that which He was not might be redeemed, in order that He might call us by means of that which He was not to that which He was.</p>

<p>108. O the divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of that cross, on which weakness hangs, might is free, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are nailed, and triumphal trophies raised. So that a certain saint said: <q>Pierce my flesh with nails for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of You;</q>  he says not with nails of iron, but of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For the bonds of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are stronger than those of punishment. Lastly, his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> bound Peter, when he had followed the Lord as far as the hall of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, whom no one had bound, and punishment loosened not him, whom <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> bound. Again, when he was bound by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> loosed him, punishment did not hold him, because he had not gone back from Christ.</p>

<p>109. Therefore do you also crucify <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that you may die to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; he who dies to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> lives to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; do you live to Him Who spared not His own Son, that in His body He might crucify our <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For Christ died for us, that we might live in His revived Body. Therefore not our life but our guilt died in Him, <q>Who,</q> it is said, <q>bare our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in His own Body on the tree; that being set free from our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> we might live in righteousness, by the wound of Whose stripes we are healed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340923"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:24</a></span> </p>

<p>110. That wood of the cross is, then, as it were a kind of ship of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, our passage, not a punishment, for there is no other <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> but the passage of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Whilst expecting death I do not feel it; while thinking little of punishment I do not suffer; while careless of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not.</p>

<p>111. Who, then, is He by the wound of Whose stripes we are healed but Christ the Lord? Of Whom the same Isaiah prophesied His stripes were our healing, <span class="stiki" id="note340924"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;53:5</a></span> of Whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the Apostle wrote in his epistle: <q>Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but was made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340925"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse21">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:21</a></span> This, indeed, was divine in Him, that His Flesh did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor did the creature of the body take in Him <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For what wonder would it be if the Godhead alone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> not, seeing It had no incentives to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? But if God alone is free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, certainly every creature by its own nature can be, as we have said, liable to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p>That the Spirit forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is common to Him with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but not with the Angels.</p>

<p>112. Tell me, then, whoever you are who deny the Godhead of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. The Spirit could not be liable to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, Who rather forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Does an Angel forgive? Does an Archangel? Certainly not, but the Father alone, the Son alone, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> alone. Now no one is unable to avoid that which he has power to forgive.</p>

<p>113. But perhaps some one will say that the Seraph said to Isaiah: <q>Behold, this has touched your lips, and shall take away your iniquities, and purge away your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340926"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;6:7</a></span> Shall take away, he says, and shall purge, not I will take away, but that fire from the altar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit. For what else can we piously understand to be on the altar of God but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit? Certainly not the wood of the forests, nor the soot and coals. Or what is so in accordance with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> as to understand according to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> that it was revealed by the mouth of Isaiah that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should be cleansed by the passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who as a coal according to the flesh burnt up our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as you read in Zechariah: <q>Is not this a brand cast forth from the fire? And that was Joshua clothed in filthy garments.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340927"><a href="../bible/zec003.htm#verse2">Zechariah&nbsp;3:2-3</a></span> </p>

<p>114. Lastly, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the common redemption was most clearly revealed by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, you have also in this place: <q>Lo, it has taken away your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>;</q>  not that Christ put aside His <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> Who did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but that in the flesh of Christ the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> should be loosed from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>115. But even if the Seraph had taken away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it would have been as one of the ministers of God appointed to this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. For thus said Isaiah: <q>For one of the Seraphim was sent to me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340929"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;6:6</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p>The Spirit is sent to all, and passes not from place to place, for He is not limited either by time or space. He goes forth from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as the Son from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in Whom He ever abides: and also comes to us when we receive. He comes also after the same manner as the Father Himself, from Whom He can by no means be separated.</p>

<p>116. The Spirit, also, is indeed said to be sent, but the Seraph to one, the Spirit to all. The Seraph is sent to minister, the Spirit works a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. The Seraph performs what is commanded, the Spirit divides as He wills. The Seraph passes from place to place, for he does not fill all things, but is himself filled by the Spirit. The Seraph comes down with a certain mode of passage according to his nature, but we cannot think this of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, of Whom the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> says: <q>When the Paraclete shall come, even the Spirit of Truth, Whom I send unto you, Who proceeds from the Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340930"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;15:26</a></span> </p>

<p>117. For if the Spirit proceeds from a place and passes to a place, both the Father Himself will be found in a place, and the Son likewise. If He goes forth from a place, Whom the Father or the Son sends, certainly the Spirit passing from a place, and making progress, seems to leave, according to those impious interpretations, both the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> like some material body.</p>

<p>118. I am saying this with reference to those who say that the Spirit comes down by movement. But neither the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who is above all not only of corporeal nature, but also of the invisible creation, is circumscribed in any place; nor is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, Who, as the Worker of all creation, is above every creature, enclosed by the places or times of His own works; nor is the Spirit of Truth as being the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, circumscribed by any corporeal limits, Who since He is incorporeal is far above the whole rational creation through the ineffable fullness of His Godhead, having over all things the power of breathing where He wills, and of inspiring as He wills. <span class="stiki" id="note340931"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse8">John&nbsp;3:8</a></span> </p>

<p>119. The Spirit is not, then, sent as it were from a place, nor does He proceed as from a place, when He proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as the Son Himself, when He says, <q>I came forth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and have come into the world,</q>  destroys all fancies, which can be reckoned as from place to place. In like manner, also, when we read that God is within or without, we certainly do not either enclose God within anybody or separate Him from anybody, but weighing these things in a deep and ineffable estimation, we comprehend the hiddenness of the divine nature.</p>

<p>120. Lastly, Wisdom so says that she came forth from the mouth of the Most High, <span class="stiki" id="note340933"><!--k28--<a href="../bible/ecc024.htm#verse5">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;24:5</a></span> as not to be external to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but with the Father; for <q>the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340934"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> and not only with God but also in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for He says: <q>I am in the Father and the Father is in Me.</q>  But neither when He goes forth from the Father does He retire from a place, nor is He separated as a body from a body; nor when He is in the Father is He as if a body enclosed as it were in a body. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also, when He proceeds from the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, is not separated from the Father nor separated from the Son. For how could He be separated from the Father Who is the Spirit of His mouth? Which is certainly both a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and expresses the Unity of this Godhead.</p>

<p>121. He exists then, and abides always, Who is the Spirit of His mouth, but He seems to come down when we receive Him, that He may dwell in us, that we may not be alien from His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. To us He seems to come down, not that He does come down, but that our mind ascends to Him. Of which we would speak more fully did we not remember that in the former treatise  there was set forth that the Father said: <q>Let us go down and confound their language,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340937"><a href="../bible/gen011.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;11:7</a></span> and that the Son said: <q>He that loves Me will keep My saying, and My Father will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him, and We will come to Him and make Our abode with Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340938"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;14:23</a></span> </p>

<p>122. The Spirit, then, so comes as does the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for where the Father is there is also the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and where the Son is there is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, therefore, is not to be supposed to come separately. But He comes not from place to place, but from the disposition of the order to the safety of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of giving life to that of sanctification, to translate us from earth to heaven, from wretchedness to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, from slavery to a kingdom.</p>

<p>123. The Spirit comes, then, as the Father comes. For the Son said, <q>I and the Father will come, and will make Our abode with Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340939"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;14:23</a></span> Does the Father come in a bodily fashion? Thus, then, comes the Spirit in Whom, when He comes, is the full presence of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</p>

<p>124. But who can separate the Spirit from the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, since we cannot even name the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> without the Spirit? <q>For no one says Lord Jesus, except in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340940"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:3</a></span> If, then, we cannot call Jesus Lord except in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, we certainly cannot proclaim Him without the Spirit. But if the Angels also proclaim Jesus to be Lord, Whom no one can proclaim except in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, then in them also the office of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> operates.</p>

<p>125. We have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, then, that the presence and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are one, which is so heavenly and divine that the Son gives thanks therefore to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, saying, <q>I give thanks to You, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, and hast revealed them unto babes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340941"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;11:25</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p>The peace and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are one, so also is Their charity one, which showed itself chiefly in the redemption of man. Their communion with man is also one.</p>

<p>126. <span class="sc">Therefore</span> since the calling is one, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is also one. Lastly, it is written: <q>Grace unto you and peace from God our Father, and from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340942"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;1:7</a></span> You see, then, that we are told that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is one, and the peace of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is one, but this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and peace is the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as the Apostle taught us himself, saying: <q>But the fruit of the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, peace, patience.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340943"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians&nbsp;5:22</a></span> And peace is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and necessary that no one be troubled with doubtful disputations, nor be shaken by the storm of bodily <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but that his affections may remain quietly disposed as to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with simplicity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and tranquillity of mind.</p>

<p>127. As to peace we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the point; but as to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Zechariah says, that God promised to pour upon Jerusalem the spirit of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy, <span class="stiki" id="note340944"><a href="../bible/zec012.htm#verse10">Zechariah&nbsp;12:10</a></span> and the Apostle Peter says: <q>Repent and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> every one of you in the Name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and you shall receive the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340945"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse38">Acts&nbsp;2:38</a></span> So <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> comes also of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> as of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. For how can there be <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, since all <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>?</p>

<p>128. Nor do we read only of the peace and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but also, faithful Emperor, of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and communion. For of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it has been said: <q>The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340946"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:14</a></span> We have heard of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father. The same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is the Father's is also the Son's. For He Himself said: <q>He that loves Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340947"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse21">John&nbsp;14:21</a></span> And what is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but that He offered Himself for us, and redeemed us with His own blood. <span class="stiki" id="note340948"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;5:2</a></span> But the same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for it is written: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so loved the world, that He gave His Only-begotten Son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340949"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;3:16</a></span> </p>

<p>129. So, then, the Father gave the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Son gave Himself. Love is preserved and due affection is not wronged, for affection is not wronged where there is no distress in the giving up. He gave one Who was willing, He gave One Who offered Himself, the Father did not give the Son to punishment but to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. If you enquire into the merit of the deed, enquire into the description of the affection. The vessel of election shows plainly the unity of this divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, because both the Father gave the Son and the Son gave Himself. The Father gave, Who <q>spared not His own Son, but gave Him up for us all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340950"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;8:32</a></span> And of the Son he also says: <q>Who gave Himself for me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340951"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">Galatians&nbsp;2:20</a></span> <q>Gave Himself,</q> he says. If it be of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, what do I find fault with. If it be that He suffered wrong, I owe the more.</p>

<p>130. But learn that in like manner as the Father gave the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Son gave Himself, so, too, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> gave Him. For it is written: <q>Then was Jesus led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q>  So, too, the loving Spirit gave the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For as the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is one, so, too, we have shown that this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and is the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, because <q>the fruit of the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, peace, patience.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340953"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians&nbsp;5:22</a></span> </p>

<p>131. And that there is communion between the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is plain, for it is written: <q>And our communion is with the Father and with His Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340954"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> And in another place: <q>The communion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> be with you all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340955"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:14</a></span> If, then, the peace of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is one, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> one, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one, and the communion one, the working is certainly one, and where the working is one, certainly the power cannot be divided nor the substance separated. For, if so, how could the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the same working agree?</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.</h2>

<p>St. Ambrose shows from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> that the Name of the Three Divine Persons is one, and first the unity of the Name of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, inasmuch as each is called Paraclete and Truth.</p>

<p>132. Who, then, would dare to deny the oneness of Name, when he sees the oneness of the working. But why should I maintain the unity of the Name by arguments, when there is the plain testimony of the Divine Voice that the Name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is one? For it is written: <q>Go, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> all nations in the Name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340956"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> He said, <q>in the Name,</q> not <q>in the Names.</q> So, then, the Name of the Father is not one, that of the Son another, and that of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> another, for God is one; the Names are not more than one, for there are not two Gods, or three Gods.</p>

<p>132. And that He might reveal that the Godhead is one and the Majesty one, because the Name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is one, and the Son did not come in one Name and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in another, the Lord Himself said: <q>I have come in My Father's Name, and you did not receive Me, if another shall come in his own name you will receive him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340957"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse43">John&nbsp;5:43</a></span> </p>

<p>133. And Scripture makes clear that that which is the Father's Name, the same is also that of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, for the Lord said in Exodus: <q>I will go before you in My Name, and will call by My Name the Lord before you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340958"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse19">Exodus&nbsp;33:19</a></span> So, then, the Lord said that He would call the Lord by His Name. The Lord, then, is the Name of the Father and of the Son.</p>

<p>134. But since the Name of the Father and of the Son is one, learn that the same is the Name of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also, since the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> came in the Name of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as it is written: <q>But the Paraclete, even the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, Whom the Father will send in My Name, He shall teach you all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340959"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;14:26</a></span> But He Who came in the Name of the Son came also certainly in the Name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for the Name of the Father and of the Son is one. Thus it comes to pass that the Name of the Father and of the Son is also that of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For there is no other Name given under heaven wherein we must be saved. <span class="stiki" id="note340960"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse12">Acts&nbsp;4:12</a></span> </p>

<p>155. At the same time He showed that the oneness of the Divine Name must be taught, not the difference, since Christ came in the oneness of the Name, but <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> will come in his own name, as it is written: <q>I have come in My Father's Name, and you did not receive Me, if another shall come in his own name, you will receive him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340961"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse43">John&nbsp;5:43</a></span> </p>

<p>156. We are, then, clearly taught by these passages that there is no difference of Name in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and that that which is the Name of the Father is also the Name of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and likewise that which is the Name of the Son is also that of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, when the Son also is called Paraclete, as is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. And therefore does the Lord Jesus say in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>I will ask My Father, and He shall give you another Paraclete, to be with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340962"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;14:16</a></span> And He said well <q>another,</q> that you might not suppose that the Son is also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, for oneness is of the Name, not a Sabellian confusion of the Son and of the Spirit. </p>

<p>157. So, then, the Son is one Paraclete, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> another Paraclete; for John called the Son a Paraclete, as you find: <q>If any man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we have a Paraclete [Advocate] with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340964"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:1</a></span> So in like manner as there is a oneness of name, so, too, is there a oneness of power, for where the Paraclete Spirit is, there is also the Son.</p>

<p>158. For as the Lord says in this place that the Spirit will be forever with the faithful, so, too, does He elsewhere show that He will Himself be forever with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, saying: <q>Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340965"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;28:20</a></span> Therefore the Son and the Spirit are one, the Name of the Trinity is one, and the Presence one and indivisible.</p>

<p>159. But as we show that the Son is called the Paraclete, so, too, do we show that the Spirit is called the Truth. Christ is the Truth, the Spirit is the Truth, for you find in John's epistle: <q>For the Spirit is Truth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340966"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:7</a></span> Not only, then, is the Spirit called the Spirit of Truth, but also the Truth, as the Son is also declared to be the Truth, Who says: <q>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340967"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 14.</h2>

<p>Each Person of the Trinity is said in the sacred writings to be Light. The Spirit is designated Fire by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, a figure of which Fire was seen in the bush by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, in the tongues of fire, and in Gideon's pitchers. And the Godhead of the same Spirit cannot be denied, since His operation is the same as that of the Father and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and He is also called the light and fire of the Lord's countenance.</p>

<p>160. But why should I argue that as the Father is light, so, too, the Son is light, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is light? Which certainly pertains to the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For God is Light, as John said: <q>For God is Light, and in Him is no darkness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340968"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:5</a></span> </p>

<p>161. But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, too, is Light, because <q>the Life was the Light of men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340969"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse8">John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> And the Evangelist, that he might show that he was speaking of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, says of John the Baptist: <q>He was not light, but [was sent] to be a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the Light. That was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light, which lights every man that comes into this world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340970"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;1:9</a></span> So, then, since God is Light, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</p>

<p>162. And you find elsewhere that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is Light: <q>The people that sat in darkness and in the shadow of death have seen a great light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340971"><a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;9:2</a></span> But, which is still more clear, it is said: <q>For with You is the fount of Life, and in Your light we shall see light,</q>  which means that with You, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Almighty, Who art the Fount of Life, in Your Son Who is the Light, we shall see the light of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. As the Lord Himself shows, saying: <q>Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340973"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;20:22</a></span> and elsewhere: <q>Virtue went out from Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340974"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;6:19</a></span> </p>

<p>163. But who can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the Father is Light, when we read of His Son that He is the Brightness of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Light? For of Whom but of the Father is the Son the Brightness, Who both is always with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and always shines, not with unlike but with the same radiance.</p>

<p>164. And Isaiah shows that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not only Light but also Fire, saying: <q>And the light of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be for a fire.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340975"><a href="../bible/isa010.htm#verse17">Isaiah&nbsp;10:17</a></span> So the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> called Him a burning Fire, because in those three points we see more intensely the majesty of the Godhead; since to sanctify is of the Godhead, to illuminate is the property of fire and light, and the Godhead is wont to be pointed out or seen in the appearance of fire: <q>For our God is a consuming Fire,</q> as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said. <span class="stiki" id="note340976"><a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse24">Deuteronomy&nbsp;4:24</a></span> </p>

<p>165. For he himself saw the fire in the bush, and had heard God when the voice from the flame of fire came to him saying: <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340977"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;3:6</a></span> The voice came from the fire, and the voice was in the bush, and the fire did no harm. For the bush was burning but was not consumed, because in that <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> the Lord was showing that He would come to illuminate the thorns of our body, and not to consume those who were in misery, but to alleviate their misery; Who would <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and with fire, that He might give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and destroy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note340978"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;3:11</a></span> So in the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of fire God keeps His intention.</p>

<p>166. In the Acts of the Apostles, also, when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> had descended upon the faithful, the appearance of fire was seen, for you read thus: <q>And suddenly there was a sound from heaven, as though the Spirit were borne with great vehemence, and it filled all the house where they were sitting, and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340979"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;2:2-3</a></span> </p>

<p>167. For the same reason was it that when Gideon was about to overcome the Midianites, he commanded three hundred men to take pitchers, and to hold lighted torches inside the pitchers, and trumpets in their right hands. Our predecessors have preserved the explanation received from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that the pitchers are our bodies, fashioned of clay, which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> if they burn with the fervour of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the passion of the Lord Jesus with a loud confession of the Voice.</p>

<p>168. Who, then, can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of the Godhead of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, since where the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit is, there the manifestation of the Godhead appears. By which evidence we infer not a diversity but the unity of the divine power. For how can there be a severance of power, where the effect of the working in all is one?</p>

<p>169. What, then, is that fire? Not certainly one made up of common twigs, or roaring with the burning of the reeds of the woods, but that fire which improves good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> like gold, and consumes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> like stubble. This is undoubtedly the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, Who is called both the fire and light of the countenance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; light as we said above: <q>The light of Your countenance has been sealed upon us, O Lord.</q>  What is, then, the light that is sealed, but that of the seal of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, believing in Whom, <q>you were sealed,</q> he says, <q>with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of promise.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340981"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> </p>

<p>170. And as there is a light of the divine countenance, so, too, does fire shine forth from the countenance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it is written: <q>A fire shall burn in His sight.</q>  For the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the day of judgment shines beforehand, that forgiveness may follow to reward the service of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. O the great fullness of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, which no one can comprehend with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> genius! O greatest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the Divine Unity! For how many things are pointed out in these two verses!</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is Life equally with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whether the Father be mentioned, with Whom is the Fount of Life, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that Fount can be none other than the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>171. We have said that the Father is Light, the Son is Light, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is Light; let us also learn that the Father is Life, the Son Life, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> Life. For John said: <q>That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, and which we have seen, and have beheld with our eyes, and our hands have handled concerning the Word of Life; and the Life appeared, and we saw and testify, and declare to you of that Life which was with the Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340983"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:1-2</a></span> He said both Word of Life and Life that he might signify both the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> to be Life. For what is the Word of Life but the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>? And by this phrase both God and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> are shown to be Life. And as it is said the Word of Life, so, too, the Spirit of Life. Therefore, as the Word of Life is Life, so, too, the Spirit of Life is Life.</p>

<p>172. Learn now that as the Father is the Fount of Life, so, too, many have stated that the Son is signified as the Fount of Life;  so that, he says, with You, Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Your Son is the Fount of Life. That is the Fount of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,  for the Spirit is Life, as the Lord says: <q>The words which I speak unto you are Spirit and Life,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340986"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse64">John&nbsp;6:64</a></span> for where the Spirit is, there also is Life; and where Life is, is also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>173. Many, however, consider that in this passage the Father only is signified by the Fount. Let them, however, notice what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> relates: <q>With You is the Well of Life.</q> That is, the Son is with the Father; since the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who was in the beginning, and was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>174. But whether in this place one understands the Fount to be the Father or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, we certainly do not understand a fount of that water which is created, but the Fount of that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, that is, of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, for He is the living water. Wherefore the Lord said: <q>If you know the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Who He is that says to you, Give me to drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340987"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;4:10</a></span> </p>

<p>175. This was the water for which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of David thirsted. The hart desires the fountain of these waters,  not thirsting for the poison of serpents. For the water of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit is living, that it may purify the inner parts of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and wash away every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and purify the transgression of hidden faults.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is that large river by which the mystical Jerusalem is watered. It is equal to its Fount, that is, the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as is signified in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture. St. Ambrose himself thirsts for that water, and warns us that in order to preserve it within us, we must avoid the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, since our vessels are frail, and that broken cisterns must be forsaken, that after the example of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and of the patriarchs we may find the water of the Lord.</p>

<p>176. But lest perchance any one should speak against as it were the littleness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and from this should endeavour to establish a difference in greatness, arguing that water seems to be but a small part of a Fount, although examples taken from creatures seem by no means suitable for application to the Godhead; yet lest they should judge anything injuriously from this comparison taken from creatures, let them learn that not only is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> called Water, but also a River, as we read: <q>From his belly shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, Whom they were beginning to receive, who were about to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340989"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;7:38-39</a></span> </p>

<p>177. So, then, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is the River, and the abundant River, which according to the Hebrews flowed from Jesus in the lands, as we have received it prophesied by the mouth of Isaiah. <span class="stiki" id="note340990"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;66:12</a></span> This is the great River which flows always and never fails. And not only a river, but also one of copious stream and overflowing greatness, as also David said: <q>The stream of the river makes glad the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>

<p>178. For neither is that city, the heavenly Jerusalem, watered by the channel of any earthly river, but that <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, proceeding from the Fount of Life, by a short draught of Whom we are satiated, seems to flow more abundantly among those celestial Thrones, Dominions and Powers, Angels and Archangels, rushing in the full course of the seven <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the Spirit. For if a river rising above its banks overflows, how much more does the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, rising above every creature, when He touches the as it were low-lying fields of our minds, make glad that heavenly nature of the creatures with the larger fertility of His sanctification.</p>

<p>179. And let it not trouble you that either here it is said <q>rivers,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340992"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;7:38</a></span> or elsewhere <q>seven Spirits,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340993"><a href="../bible/rev005.htm#verse6">Revelation&nbsp;5:6</a></span> for by the sanctification of these seven gifts of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as Isaiah said, <span class="stiki" id="note340994"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;11:2</a></span> is signified the fullness of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and strength, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and godliness, and the Spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. One, then, is the River, but many the channels of the gifts of the Spirit. This River, then, goes forth from the Fount of Life.</p>

<p>180. And here, again, you must not turn aside your thoughts to lower things, because there seems to be some difference between a Fount and a River, and yet the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> has provided that the weakness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> understanding should not be injured by the lowliness of the language. Set before yourself any river, it springs from its fount, but is of one nature, of one brightness and beauty. And do you assert rightly that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is of one substance, brightness, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. I will sum up all in the oneness of the qualities, and shall not be afraid of any question as to difference of greatness. For in this point also Scripture has provided for us; for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> says: <q>He that shall drink of the water which I will give him, it shall become in him a well of water springing up unto everlasting life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340995"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;4:14</a></span> This well is clearly the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, a stream proceeding from the living Fount. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, then, is also the Fount of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</p>

<p>181. You observe, then, from His words that the unity of the divine greatness is pointed out, and that Christ cannot be denied to be a Fount even by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, too, is called a Fount. And as the Spirit is called a river, so, too, the Father said: <q>Behold, I come down upon you like a river of peace, and like a stream overflowing the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340996"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;66:12</a></span> And who can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is the River of life, from Whom the streams of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life flowed forth?</p>

<p>182. Good, then, is this water, even the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit. Who will give this Fount to my breast? Let it spring up in me, let that which gives <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life flow upon me. Let that Fount overflow upon us, and not flow away. For Wisdom says: <q>Drink water out of your own vessels, and from the founts of your own wells, and let your waters flow abroad in your streets.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340997"><a href="../bible/pro005.htm#verse15">Proverbs&nbsp;5:15-16</a></span> How shall I keep this water that it flow not forth, that it glide not away? How shall I preserve my vessel, lest any crack of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> penetrating it, should let the water of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life exude? Teach us, Lord Jesus, teach us as You taught Your <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, saying: <q>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where rust and moth destroy, and where thieves break through and steal.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340998"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;6:19</a></span> </p>

<p>182. For He intimates that the thief is the unclean spirit, who cannot find entrance into those who walk in the light of good works, but if he has caught any one in the darkness of earthly desires, and in the midst of the enjoyment of earthly pleasures, he spoils them of all the flower of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And therefore the Lord says: <q>Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither rust nor moth destroy, and where thieves do not break through and steal. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</q></p>

<p>183. Our rust is wantonness, our rust is <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, our rust is luxury, which dim the keen vision of the mind with the filth of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Again, our moth is <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, our moth is Photinus, who rend the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> vesture of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with their impiety, and desiring to separate the indivisible unity of the divine power, gnaw the precious veil of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> tooth. The water is spilt if <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> has imprinted his tooth, it flows away if Photinus has planted his sting in any one's vessel. We are but of common clay, we quickly feel <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. But no one says to the potter, <q>Why have You made me thus?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note340999"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;9:20</a></span> For though our vessel be but common, yet one is in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, another in dishonour. <span class="stiki" id="note341000"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;9:21</a></span> Do not then lay open your pool, dig not with <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and crimes, lest any one say: <q>He has opened a pool and dug it, and is fallen into the pit which he made.</q> </p>

<p>184. If you seek Jesus, forsake the broken cisterns, for Christ was wont to sit not by a pool but by a well. There that <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <span class="stiki" id="note341002"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;4:6</a></span> found Him, she who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, she who wished to draw water. Although you ought to have come in early morning, nevertheless if you come later, even at the sixth hour, you will find Jesus wearied with His journey. He is weary, but it is through you, because He has long sought you, your unbelief has long wearied Him. Yet He is not offended if you only comest, He asks to drink Who is about to give. But He drinks not the water of a stream flowing by, but your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; He drinks your good dispositions, He drinks the cup, that is, the Passion which atoned for your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that you drinking of His sacred blood might quench the thirst of this world.</p>

<p>185. So <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> gained God after he had dug the well. <span class="stiki" id="note341003"><a href="../bible/gen021.htm#verse30">Genesis&nbsp;21:30</a></span> So Isaac, while walking by the well, received that wife <span class="stiki" id="note341004"><a href="../bible/gen024.htm#verse62">Genesis&nbsp;24:62</a></span> who was coming to him as a type of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Faithful he was at the well, unfaithful at the pool. Lastly, too, Rebecca, as we read, found him who sought her at the well, and the harlots washed themselves in the blood in the pool of <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel</a>. </p>
