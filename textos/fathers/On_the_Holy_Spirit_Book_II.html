<h1>On the Holy Spirit, Book II</h1>

<h2>Introduction.</h2>

<p>The Three Persons of the Godhead were not unknown to the judges of old nor to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, for the equality of the Son with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as well as of the Three Persons among Themselves, is laid down both elsewhere and by him. Samson also enjoyed the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, his history is touched upon and shown to be in some points typical of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and her <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> left Samson he fell into various calamities, and St. Ambrose explains the spiritual significance of his shorn locks.</p>

<p>1. Even in reading the first book of the ancient history it is made clear both that the sevenfold <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit shone forth in the judges themselves of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, of Whose <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. Then, too, at the very beginning of the world, and indeed before its beginning, he conjoined Him with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> before the beginning of the world. For if any one takes good heed he will recognize in the beginning both the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Spirit. For of the Father it is written: <q>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341006"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;1:1</a></span> Of the Spirit it is said: <q>The Spirit was borne upon the waters.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341007"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;1:4</a></span> And well in the beginning of creation is there set forth the figure of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> whereby the creature had to be purified. And of the Son we read that He it is Who divided light from darkness, for there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> the Father Who speaks, and one God the Son Who acts.</p>

<p>2. But, again, that you may not think that there was assumption in the bidding of Him Who spoke, or inferiority on the part of Him Who carried out the bidding, the Father acknowledges the Son as equal to Himself in the execution of the work, saying: <q>Let Us make man after Our image and likeness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341008"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> For the common image and the working and the likeness can signify nothing but the oneness of the same Majesty.</p>

<p>3. But that we may more fully recognize the equality of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as the Father spoke, the Son made, so, too, the Father works and the Son speaks. The Father works, as it is written: <q>My Father works hitherto.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341009"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;5:17</a></span> You find it said to the Son: <q>Say the word and he shall be healed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341010"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;8:8</a></span> And the Son says to the Father: <q>I will that where I am, they too shall be with Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341011"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;17:24</a></span> The Father did what the Son said.</p>

<p>4. But neither was <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; he saw Three and worshipped One, for there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, one Lord, and one Spirit. And so there is a oneness of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, because there is a oneness of power.</p>

<p>5. And why should I speak of all one by one? Samson, born by the divine promise, had the Spirit accompanying him, for we read: <q>The Lord blessed him, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> began to be with him in the camp.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341012"><a href="../bible/jdg013.htm#verse25">Judges&nbsp;13:25</a></span> And so foreshadowing the future <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, he demanded a wife of the aliens, which, as it is written, his father and mother <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not of, because it was from the Lord. And rightly was he esteemed stronger than others, because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> guided him, under Whose guidance he alone put to flight the people of the aliens, and at another time inaccessible to the bite of the lion, he, unconquerable in his strength, tore him asunder with his hands. Would that he had been as careful to preserve <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as strong to overcome the beast!</p>

<p>6. And perhaps this was not only a prodigy of valour, but also a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of wisdom, an utterance of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. For it does not seem to have been without a purpose that, as he was going to his marriage, a roaring lion met him, which he tore asunder with his hands, in whose body, when about to enjoy the wished-for wedlock, he found a swarm of bees, and took honey from its mouth, which he gave to his father and mother to eat. The people of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> had honey, the people which was before savage is now the people of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>7. Nor is the riddle without <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, which he set forth to his companions: <q>Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341013"><a href="../bible/jdg014.htm#verse14">Judges&nbsp;14:14</a></span> And there was a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> up to the point of the three days in which its answer was sought in vain, which could not be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> except by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, on the seventh day, the time of the Law being completed, after the Passion of the Lord. For thus you find that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> did not understand, <q>because Jesus was not yet <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341014"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;7:39</a></span> </p>

<p>8. <q>What,</q> answer they, <q>is sweeter than honey, and what is stronger than a lion?</q> To which he replied: <q>If you had not farmed with my heifer, you would not have found out my riddle.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341015"><a href="../bible/jdg014.htm#verse18">Judges&nbsp;14:18</a></span> O divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>! O manifest sacrament! We have escaped from the slayer, we have overcome the strong one. The food of life is now there, where before was the hunger of a miserable death. Dangers are changed into safety, bitterness into sweetness. Grace came forth from the offense, power from weakness, and life from death.</p>

<p>9. There are, however, who think on the other hand that the wedlock could not have been established unless the lion of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a> had been slain; and so in His body, that is, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, bees were found who store up the honey of wisdom, because after the Passion of the Lord the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> more fully. This lion, then, Samson as a Jew slew, but in it he found honey, as in the figure of the heritage which was to be redeemed, that the remnant might be saved according to the election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note341016"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;11:5</a></span> </p>

<p>10. <q>And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a>,</q> it is said, <q>came upon him, and he went down to <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>, and smote thirty men of them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341017"><a href="../bible/jdg014.htm#verse19">Judges&nbsp;14:19</a></span> For he could not fail to carry off the victory who saw the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. And so in the garments they receive the reward of wisdom, the badge of intercourse, who resolve and answer the riddle.</p>

<p>11. Here, again, other <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> come up, in that his wife is taken away, and for this foxes set fire to the sheaves of the aliens. For their own cunning often deceives those who contend against divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. Wherefore it is said again in the Song of Songs: <q>Take us the little foxes which destroy the vineyards, that our vineyards may flourish.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341018"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse15">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:15</a></span> He said well <q>little,</q> because the larger could not destroy the vineyards, though to the strong even the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is weak.</p>

<p>12. So, then, he (to sum up the story briefly, for the consideration of the whole passage is reserved for its own season) was unconquered so long as he kept the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as was the people of God chosen by the Lord, that Nazarite under the Law. Samson, then, was unconquered, and so invincible as to be able to smite a thousand men with the jawbone of an ass; <span class="stiki" id="note341019"><a href="../bible/jdg015.htm#verse15">Judges&nbsp;15:15</a></span> so full of heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that when thirsty he found even water in the jawbone of an ass, whether you consider this as a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, or turn it to a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, because in the humility of the people of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> there would be both rest and triumph according to that which is written: <q>He that smites you on the cheek, turn to him also the other.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341020"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;5:39</a></span> For by this endurance of injuries, which the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> teaches, we triumph over the stings of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, that having passed through death we may attain to the rest of the resurrection.</p>

<p>13. Is that, then, Samson who broke ropes twisted with thongs, and new cords like weak threads? Is that Samson who did not feel the bonds of his hair fastened to the beam, so long as he had the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit? He, I say, after the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> departed from him, was greatly changed from that Samson Who returned clothed in the spoils of the aliens, but fallen from his greatness on the knees of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, caressed and deceived, is shorn of his hair. </p>

<p>14. Was, then, the hair of his head of such importance that, so long as it remained, his strength should endure unconquered, but when his head was shorn the man should suddenly lose all his strength? It is not so, nor may we think that the hair of his head has such power. There is the hair of religion and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; the hair of the Nazarite perfect in the Law, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in sparingness and abstinence, with which she (a type of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>), who poured ointment on the feet of the Lord, wiped the feet of the heavenly Word, for then she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Christ also after the flesh. That hair it is of which it is said: <q>Your hair is as flocks of goats,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341022"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse1">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:1</a></span> growing on that head of which it is said: <q>The head of the man is Christ,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341023"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3</a></span> and in another place: <q>His head is as fine gold, and his locks like black pine-trees.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341024"><a href="../bible/son005.htm#verse11">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;5:11</a></span> </p>

<p>15. And so, also, in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> our Lord, pointing out that some hairs are seen and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, says: <q>But even the hairs of your head are all numbered,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341025"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;10:30</a></span> implying, indeed, acts of spiritual <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for God does not take care for our hair. Though, indeed, it is not absurd to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that literally, seeing that according to His divine Majesty nothing can be hidden from Him.</p>

<p>16. But what does it profit me, if God Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all my hairs? That rather abounds and profits me, if the watchful <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of good works reward me with the gift of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. And, in fine, Samson himself, declaring that these hairs are not mystical, says: <q>If I be shorn my strength will depart from me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341026"><a href="../bible/jdg016.htm#verse17">Judges&nbsp;16:17</a></span> So much concerning the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, let us now consider the order of the passage.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.</h2>

<p>The Spirit is the Lord and Power; and in this is not inferior to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</p>

<p>17. Above, you read that <q>the Lord blessed him, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> began to go with him.</q>  Farther on it is said: <q>And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> came upon him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341028"><a href="../bible/jdg014.htm#verse6">Judges&nbsp;14:6</a></span> Again he says: <q>If I be shaven, my strength will depart from me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341029"><a href="../bible/jdg016.htm#verse17">Judges&nbsp;16:17</a></span> After he was shaven, see what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says: <q>The Lord,</q> he says, <q>departed from him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341030"><a href="../bible/jdg016.htm#verse20">Judges&nbsp;16:20</a></span> </p>

<p>18. You see, then, that He Who went with him, Himself departed from him. The Same is, then, the Lord, Who is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a>, that is, he called the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, Lord, as also the Apostle says: <q>The Lord is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, now where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is, there is liberty.</q> You find, then, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> called the Lord; for the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and the Son are not one Person [<em>unus</em>] but one Substance [<em>unum</em>].</p>

<p>19. In this place he used the word Power, and implied the Spirit. For as the Father is Power, so, too, the Son is Power, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is Power. Of the Son you have read that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <q>the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341031"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> We read, too, that the Father is Power, as it is written: <q>You shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> sitting at the right hand of the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341032"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse64">Matthew&nbsp;26:64</a></span> He certainly named the Father Power, at Whose right hand the Son sits, as you read: <q>The Lord said unto My Lord, Sit on My right hand.</q>  And the Lord Himself named the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> Power, when He said: <q>You shall receive Power when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> comes upon you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341034"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse8">Acts&nbsp;1:8</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p>The Father, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are One in counsel.</p>

<p>20. For the Spirit Himself is Power, as you read: <q>The Spirit of Counsel and of Power (or might).</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341035"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;11:2</a></span> And as the Son is the Angel of great counsel, so, too, is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> the Spirit of Counsel, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Counsel of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is One. Counsel, not concerning any doubtful matters, but concerning those foreknown and determined.</p>

<p>21. But that the Spirit is the Arbiter of the Divine Counsel, you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even from this. For when above  we showed that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was the Lord of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and read that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is the counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as you read, <q>But the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> despised the counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> of Him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341037"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;7:30</a></span> it is quite clear that as there can be no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, so, too, the counsel of God is not without the Spirit.</p>

<p>22. And that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> more completely that the Spirit is Power, we ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He was promised when the Lord said: <q>I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341038"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse28">Joel&nbsp;2:28</a></span> He, then, Who was promised to us is Himself Power, as in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the same <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> declared when He said: <q>And I will send the promise of the Father upon you, but do you remain in the city until ye be endued with power from on high.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341039"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;24:49</a></span> </p>

<p>23. And the Evangelist so far shows that the Spirit is Power, that St. Luke relates that He came down with great power, when he says: <q>And suddenly there was a sound from heaven, as though the Spirit were borne with great power.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341040"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;2:2</a></span> </p>

<p>24. But, again, that you may not suppose that this is to be referred to bodily things and perceptible to the senses, learn that the Spirit so descended as Christ is to descend, as you find: <q>They shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> coming in the clouds with great power and majesty.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341041"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;24:30</a></span> </p>

<p>25. For how should not the power and might be one, when the work is one, the judgment one, the temple one, the life-giving one, the sanctification one, and the kingdom also of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> one?</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p>As to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is life, so is it life to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and therefore in the Godhead He is not to be separated from the Father.</p>

<p>26. Let them say, then, wherein they think that there is an unlikeness in the divine operation. Since as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is life, as the Lord Himself declared, saying: <q>This is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Whom You have sent,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341042"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;17:3</a></span> so, too, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is life. For the Lord said: <q>If you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Me, keep My commandments, and I will ask the Father and He shall give you another Paraclete, that He may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth, Whom the world cannot receive, because it sees Him not, neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him, but you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, for He is with you, and in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341043"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;17:14-15</a></span> </p>

<p>27. So, then, the world had not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, because it had not received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; for where the Spirit is, there is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; for the Spirit Himself it is Who effects <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Wherefore I wonder why the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> stir the question as to the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. For as it is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so, too, is it <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; so, again, it is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, Whom, as also the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the world does not see, and, as also the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. But he who is not of this world has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, Who is the Light of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, remains with him for ever.</p>

<p>28. If the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God confers the same benefit as the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, why do you sever the Son and the Spirit from the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when you do not sever Him from conferring the benefit? For of necessity you must either <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that this is the greatest gift of the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead, and will confess the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead as of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, so also of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; or if you say that he, too, can give life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> who is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it will happen that you derogate rather from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Whose work you do not consider to be the chief work of the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead, but one to be compared to the work of a creature.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> gives life, not in a different way from the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, nor by a different working.</p>

<p>29. And what wonder is it the Spirit works Life, Who quickens as does the Father and as does the Son? And who can deny that quickening is the work of the Eternal Majesty? For it is written: <q>Quicken Your servant.</q>  He, then, is quickened who is a servant, that is, man, who before had not life, but received the privilege of having it.</p>

<p>30. Let us then see whether the Spirit is quickened, or Himself quickens. Now it is written: <q>The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341045"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;8:11</a></span> So, then, the Spirit quickens.</p>

<p>31. But that you may understand that the quickening of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is no separate work, read how there is a oneness of quickening also, since God Himself quickens through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: <q>He Who raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies because of His Spirit Who dwells in you.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as well as the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, is pointed out in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture as Creator, and the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was shadowed forth even by <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> writers, but it was shown most plainly in the Mystery of the Incarnation, after touching upon which, the writer maintains his argument from the fact that worship which is due to the Creator alone is paid to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>32. But who can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> gives life to all things; since both He, as the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, is the Creator of all things; and the Almighty Father is understood to have done nothing without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and since also in the beginning of the creation the Spirit moved upon the water.</p>

<p>33. So when the Spirit was moving upon the water, the creation was without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but after this world being created underwent the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, it gained all the beauty of that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, wherewith the world is illuminated. And that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> cannot abide without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> declared when he said: <q>You will take away Your Spirit, and they will fail and be turned again into their dust. Send forth Your Spirit, and they shall be made, and You will renew all the face of the earth.</q>  Not only, then, did he teach that no creature can stand without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but also that the Spirit is the Creator of the whole creation.</p>

<p>34. And who can deny that the creation of the earth is the work of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, Whose work it is that it is renewed? For if they desire to deny that it was created by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, since they cannot deny that it must be renewed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, they who desire to sever the Persons must maintain that the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is superior to that of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, which is far from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the restored earth is better than it was created. Or if at first, without the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> made the earth, but the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was joined on afterwards, it will seem that that which was made required His aid, which was then added. But far be it from any one to think this, namely, that the divine work should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have a change in the Creator, an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> brought in by Manicheus. </p>

<p>35. But do we suppose that the substance of the earth exists without the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, without Whose work not even the expanse of the sky endures? For it is written: <q>By the Word of the Lord were the heavens established, and all the strength of them by the Spirit of His Mouth.</q>  Observe what he says, that all the strength of the heavens is to be referred to the Spirit. For how should He Who was moving <span class="stiki" id="note341049"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;1:1</a></span> before the earth was made, be resting when it was being made?</p>

<p>36. Gentile writers, following ours as it were through shadows, because they could not imbibe the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, have pointed out in their verses that the Spirit within nourishes heaven and earth, and the glittering orbs of moon and stars.  So they deny not that the strength of creatures exists through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, are we who read this to deny it? But you think that they refer to a Spirit produced of the air. If they declared a Spirit of the air to be the Author of all things, do we <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> is the Creator of all things?</p>

<p>37. But why do I delay with matters not to the purpose? Let them accept a plain <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that there can be nothing which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> can be said not to have made; and that it cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that all subsists through His operation, whether Angels, Archangels, Thrones, or Dominions; since the Lord Himself, Whom the Angels serve, was begotten by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> coming upon the Virgin, as, according to Matthew, the Angel said to Joseph: <q>Joseph, you son of David, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not to take Mary your wife, for that which shall be born of her is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341051"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;1:20</a></span> And according to Luke, he said to Mary: <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> shall come upon you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341052"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;1:35</a></span> </p>

<p>38. The birth from the Virgin was, then, the work of the Spirit. The fruit of the womb is the work of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, according to that which is written: <q>Blessed are you among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and blessed is the Fruit of your womb.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341053"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;1:42</a></span> The flower from the root is the work of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, that flower, I say, of which it was well prophesied: <q>A rod shall go forth from the root of Jesse, and a flower shall rise from his root.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341054"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;11:1</a></span> The root of Jesse the patriarch is the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, Mary is the rod, Christ the flower of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, Who, about to spread the good odour of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> throughout the whole world, budded forth from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> womb, as He Himself said: <q>I am the flower of the plain, a lily of the valley.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341055"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse1">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:1</a></span> </p>

<p>39. The flower, when cut, keeps its odour, and when bruised increases it, nor if torn off does it lose it; so, too, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, on the gibbet of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, neither failed when bruised, nor fainted when torn; and when He was cut by that piercing of the spear, being made more beautiful by the colour of the outpoured Blood, He, as it were, grew comely again, not able in Himself to die, and breathing forth upon the dead the gift of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. On this flower, then, of the royal rod the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> rested.</p>

<p>40. A good rod, as some think, is the Flesh of the Lord, which, raising itself from its earthly root to heaven, bore around the whole world the sweet-smelling fruits of religion, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the divine generation, pouring <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> on the altars of heaven.</p>

<p>41. So, then, we cannot <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the Spirit is Creator, Whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> as the Author of the Lord's Incarnation. For who can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> when you find in the commencement of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that the generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was on this wise: <q>When Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child of [<em>ex</em>] the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341056"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;1:18</a></span> </p>

<p>42. For although most authorities read <q>de Spiritu,</q> yet the Greek from which the Latins translated have <q><span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C7; &#x03C0;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x1F7B;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2; &#x1F01;&#x03B3;&#x1F77;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;</span>,</q> that is, <q> <em>ex Spiritu Sancto</em>.</q> For that which is <q>of</q> [<em>ex</em>] any one is either of his substance or of his power. Of his substance, as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, Who says: <q>I came forth of the Mouth of the Most High;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341057"><a href="../bible/sir024.htm#verse3">Sirach&nbsp;24:3</a></span> as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, <q>Who proceeds from the Father;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341058"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse20">John&nbsp;15:20</a></span> of Whom the Son says: <q>He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341059"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;16:14</a></span> But of the power, as in the passage: <q>One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of Whom are all things.</q> </p>

<p>43. How, then, was Mary with child of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? If as of her substance, was the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, then, changed into flesh and bones? Certainly not. But if the Virgin conceived as of His operation and power, who can deny that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is Creator?</p>

<p>44. How is it, too, that Job plainly set forth the Spirit as his Creator, saying: <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> has made me</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note341061"><a href="../bible/job033.htm#verse4">Job&nbsp;33:4</a></span> In one short verse he showed Him to be both Divine and Creator. If, then, the Spirit is Creator, He is certainly not a creature, for the Apostle has separated the Creator and the creature, saying: <q>They served the creature rather than the Creator.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341062"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;1:25</a></span> </p>

<p>45. He teaches that the Creator is to be served by condemning those who serve the creature, whereas we owe our service to the Creator. And since he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the Spirit to be the Creator, he teaches that we ought to serve Him, saying: <q>Beware of the dogs, beware of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> workers, beware of the concision, for we are the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> who serve the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341063"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse2">Philippians&nbsp;3:2-3</a></span> </p>

<p>46. But if any one disputes because of the variations of the Latin codices, some of which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have falsified, let him look at the Greek codices, and observe that it is there written: <q><span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F31; &#x03C0;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x1F7B;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B9; &#x0398;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1F7B;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C2;</span>,</q> which is, being translated, <q>who serve the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</q></p>

<p>47. So, then, when the same Apostle says that we ought to serve the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, who asserts that we must not serve the creature, but the Creator; without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he plainly shows that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is Creator, and is to be venerated with the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> due to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Godhead; for it is written: <q>You shall worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him only shall you serve.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341064"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;4:10</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 6.</h2>

<p>To those who object that according to the words of Amos the Spirit is created, the answer is made that the word is there understood of the wind, which is often created, which cannot be said of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, since He is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and cannot be dissolved in death, or by an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> absorption into the Father. But if they pertinaciously contend that this passage was written of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, St. Ambrose points out that recourse must be had to a spiritual Interpretation, for Christ by His coming established the thunder, that is, the force of the divine utterances, and by Spirit is signified the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as also the flesh assumed by Christ. And since this was created by each Person of the Trinity, it is thence argued that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, Who has before been affirmed to be the Creator of all things, was the Author of the Incarnation of the Lord.</p>

<p>48. Nor does it escape my notice that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have been wont to object that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> appears to be a creature, because many of them use as an argument for establishing their impiety that passage of Amos, where he spoke of the blowing of the wind, as the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> made clear. For you read thus: <q>Behold, I am He that establish the thunders, and create the wind [spirit],  and declare unto man his Christ, that make light and mist, and ascend upon high places, the Lord God Almighty is His Name.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341066"><a href="../bible/amo004.htm#verse13">Amos&nbsp;4:13</a></span> </p>

<p>49. If they make an argument of this, that he said <q>spirit</q> was created, Esdras taught us that spirit is created, saying in the fourth book: <q>And upon the second day You made the spirit of the firmament,</q>  yet, that we may keep to our point, is it not evident that in what Amos said the order of the passage shows that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> was speaking of the creation of this world?</p>

<p>50. He begins as follows: <q>I am the Lord that establish the thunders and create the wind [spirit].</q> The order of the words itself teaches us; for if he had wished to speak of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, he would certainly not have put the thunders in the first place. For thunder is not more ancient than the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; though they be ungodly, they still dare not say that. And then when we see what follows concerning light and mist, is it not plain that what is said is to be understood of the creation of this world? For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by every-day experience, that when we have storms on this earth, thunders come first, blasts of wind follow on, the sky grows black with mists, and light shines again out of the darkness. For the blasts of wind are also called <q>spirits,</q> as it is written: <q>Fire and brimstone and the spirit of storm.</q> </p>

<p>51. And that you might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he called this <q>spirit,</q> he says: <q>establishing thunders and creating the wind [spirit].</q> For these are often created, when they take place. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and if any one dares to call Him a creature, still he cannot say that He is daily created like the blast of the wind. Then, again, Wisdom herself, speaking after the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the assumed Body, says: <q>The Lord created Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341069"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;8:22</a></span> Although prophesying of things to come, yet, because the coming of the Lord was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a>, it is not said <q>creates</q> but <q>created Me;</q> that men might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was begotten of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, not often, but once only.</p>

<p>52. And so, as to that which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> declared as it were of the daily working of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the thunder and the creation of the wind, it would be impious to understand any such thing of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, Whom the ungodly themselves cannot deny to exist from before the world. Whence with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> asseveration we testify that He always exists, and abides ever. For neither can He Who before the world was moving upon the waters begin to be visible after the world's creation; or else it would be allowable to suppose that there are many Holy Spirits, Who come into being by as it were a daily production. Far be it from any one to pollute himself with such impiety as to say that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is frequently or ever created. For I do not understand why He should be frequently created; unless perchance they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He dies frequently and so is frequently created. But how can the Spirit of life die? If, then, He cannot die, there is no reason why He should be often created.</p>

<p>53. But they who think otherwise fall into this sacrilege, that they do not distinguish the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; who think that the Word Which was sent forth returns to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Spirit Which was sent forth is reabsorbed into <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that there should be a reabsorption  and a kind of alternation of one changing himself into various forms; whereas the distinction between the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> always abiding and unchangeable, preserves the Unity of its power.</p>

<p>54. But if any one thinks that the word of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is to be explained with reference to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, because it is said, <q>declaring unto men His Christ,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341071"><a href="../bible/amo004.htm#verse13">Amos&nbsp;4:13</a></span> he will explain it more easily of the Lord's Incarnation. For if it troubles you that he said Spirit, and therefore you think that this cannot well be explained of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the taking of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, read on in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and you will find that all agrees most excellently with Christ, of Whom it is thoroughly fitting to think that He established the thunders by His coming, that is, the force and sound of the heavenly Scriptures, by the thunder, as it were, of which our minds are struck with astonishment, so that we learn to be afraid, and pay respect to the heavenly oracles.</p>

<p>55. Lastly, in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the brothers of the Lord were called Sons of Thunder; and when the voice was uttered of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, saying, <q>I have both <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> it and will glorify it again,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341072"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;12:28</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said that it thundered on Him. For although they could not receive the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, yet they confessed unwillingly, and in their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> were speaking <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, so that there resulted a great testimony of the Father to the Son. And in the Book of Job, too, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says: <q>And who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> when He will make the power of His thunder?</q>  Certainly if these words pertained to the thunders of the heavens, he would have said that their force was already made, not about to be made.</p>

<p>56. Therefore he referred the thunders to the words of the Lord, the sound of which went out into all the earth, and we understand the word <q>spirit</q> in this place of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which He took endowed with reason and perfect;  for Scripture often designates the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man by the word spirit, as you read: <q>Who creates the spirit of man within him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341075"><a href="../bible/zec012.htm#verse1">Zechariah&nbsp;12:1</a></span> So, too, the Lord signified His Soul by the word Spirit, when He said: <q>Into Your hands I commend My Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341076"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;23:46</a></span> </p>

<p>57. And that you might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he spoke of the coming down of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, he added that He declared His Christ to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for in His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> He declared Him, saying: <q>You are My beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in Whom I am well pleased.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341077"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;3:17</a></span> He declared Him on the mount, saying: <q>This is My beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, hear ye Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341078"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse7">Mark&nbsp;9:7</a></span> He declared Him in His Passion, when the sun hid itself, and sea and earth trembled. He declared Him in the Centurion, who said: <q>Truly this was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341079"><a href="../bible/mar015.htm#verse39">Mark&nbsp;15:39</a></span> </p>

<p>58. We ought, then, to take this whole passage either to be simply to be understood of that state in which we here live and breathe, or of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Lord's Body; for if here it had been stated that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was created, undoubtedly Scripture would elsewhere have declared the same, as we often read of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Who according to the flesh was both made and created.</p>

<p>59. But it is fitting that we should consider His Majesty in the very fact of His taking flesh for us, that we may see His divine power in the very taking of the Body. For as we read that the Father created the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Lord's Incarnation, the Spirit too created it; and so too we read that Christ Himself created His own Body. For the Father created it, as it is written: <q>The Lord created Me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341080"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse12">Proverbs&nbsp;8:12</a></span> and in another place, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341081"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;4:4</a></span> And the Spirit created the whole <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, according to that which we read, for <q>Mary was found with child of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341082"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;1:18</a></span> </p>

<p>60. You find, then, that the Father created and the Spirit created; learn, too, that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> also created, when Solomon says: <q>Wisdom has made herself a house.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341083"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;9:1</a></span> How, then, can the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> Who created the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Lord's Incarnation, which is above all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, be Himself a creature?</p>

<p>61. As we have shown above  generally that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is our Creator according to the flesh in the outer man, let us now show that He is our Creator also according to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And as the Father creates, so too does the Son create, and so too the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> creates, as we read in the words of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: <q>For it is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not of works, lest any one should boast. For we are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus in good works.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 7.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is no less the author of spiritual creation or regeneration than the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. The excellence of that creation, and wherein it consists. How we are to understand <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, when it attributes a body or members to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>62. So, then, the Father creates in good works, and the Son also, for it is written: <q>But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even to them who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His Name; who were born not of blood, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341086"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;1:12-13</a></span> </p>

<p>63. In like manner the Lord Himself also testifies that we are born again of the Spirit according to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, saying: <q>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, because it is born of flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit, because God is Spirit. Marvel not that I said unto you, You must be born again. The Spirit breathes  where He wills, and you hear His voice, but <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> not whence He comes or whither He goes, so is every one who is born of the Spirit.</q></p>

<p>64. It is then clear that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is also the Author of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, since we are created according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we may be made the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So when He has taken us into His kingdom by the adoption of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> regeneration, do we deny Him that which is His? He has made us heirs of the new birth from above, do we claim the heritage and reject its Author? But the benefit cannot remain when its Author is shut out; the Author is not without the gift, nor the gift without the Author. If you claim the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the power; if you reject the power, do not ask for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. He who has denied the Spirit has at the same time denied the gift. For if the Author be of no account how can His gifts be precious? Why do we grudge the gifts we ourselves receive, diminish our hopes, repudiate our dignity, and deny our Comforter?</p>

<p>65. But we cannot deny Him. Far be it from us to deny that which is so great, since the Apostle says: <q>But you brethren, like Isaac, are the children of promise, but as then, he that is born after the flesh persecutes him that is after the Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341088"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse28">Galatians&nbsp;4:28-29</a></span> Again certainly is understood from what has gone before, is born after the Spirit. He then who is born after the Spirit is born after God. Now we are born again when we are renewed in our inward affections and lay aside the oldness of the outer man. And so the Apostle says again: <q>But be ye renewed in the spirit of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and put on the new man which is created according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and righteousness and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341089"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse23">Ephesians&nbsp;4:23-24</a></span> Let them hear how the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has signified the unity of the divine operation. He who is renewed in the spirit of his mind has put on the new man, which is created according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>66. That more excellent regeneration is then the work of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and the Spirit is the Author of that new man which is created after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which no one will <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to be better than this outer man of ours. Since the Apostle has pointed out that the one is heavenly, the other earthly, when he says: <q>As is the heavenly, such also are the heavenly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341090"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse48">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:48</a></span> </p>

<p>67. Since, then, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit makes that to be heavenly which it can create earthy, we ought to observe by reason though we be without instances. For in a certain place <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Job says: <q>As the Lord lives, Who thus judges me, and the Almighty, Who has brought my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to bitterness (for the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> which is in my nostrils).</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341091"><a href="../bible/job027.htm#verse2">Job&nbsp;27:2-3</a></span> He certainly did not here signify by His Spirit the vital breath and bodily breathing passages, but signifies the nostrils of the inner man within him, wherewith he gathered in the fragrance of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and drew in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the heavenly ointment as with a kind of twofold sense.</p>

<p>68. For there are spiritual nostrils, as we read, which the spouse of the Word has, to whom it is said: <q>And the smell of your nostrils;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341092"><a href="../bible/son007.htm#verse8">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;7:8</a></span> and in another place: <q>The Lord smelled a smell of sweetness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341093"><a href="../bible/gen008.htm#verse21">Genesis&nbsp;8:21</a></span> There are, then, as it were, inward members of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whose hands are considered to be in action, his ears in hearing, his feet in a kind of progress in a good work. And so from what is done we gather as it were figures of the members, for it is not suitable for us to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> anything in the inner man after a fleshly manner.</p>

<p>69. And there are some who suppose that God is fashioned after a bodily manner, when they read of His hand or finger, and they do not observe that these things are written not because of any fashion of a body, since in the Godhead are neither members nor parts, but are expressions of the oneness of the Godhead, that we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that it is impossible for either the Son or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to be separated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father; since the fullness of the Godhead dwells as it were bodily in the substance of the Trinity. For this reason, then, is the Son also called the Right Hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as we read: <q>The Right Hand of the Lord has done mighty things, the Right Hand of the Lord has exalted me.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 8.</h2>

<p> <em>St. Ambrose examines and refutes the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> argument that because God is said to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and not with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is therefore inferior to the Father. He shows that the particle</em> in <em>can be also used of the Son and even of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that on the other hand</em> with <em>may be said of creatures without any infringement on the prerogatives of the Godhead; and that in reality these prepositions simply imply the connection of the Three Divine Persons.</em></p>

<p>70. But what wonder is it if foolish men question about words, when they do so even about syllables? For some think that a distinction should be made and that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be praised <em>in</em> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but not <em>with</em> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and consider that the greatness of the Godhead is to be estimated from one syllable or some custom, arguing that if they consider that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <em>in</em> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, they point to some office of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but that if they say that God receives <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> or power <em>with</em> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, they seem to imply some association and communion of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>71. But who can separate what is incapable of separation? Who can divide that association which Christ shows to be inseparable? <q>Go,</q> says He, <q><a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> all nations in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341095"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> Has He changed either a word or a syllable here concerning the Father or the Son or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? Certainly not. But He says, in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. The expression is the same for the Spirit as for the Father and for Himself. From which is inferred not any office of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but rather a sharing of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> or of working when we say <q>in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.</q></p>

<p>72. Consider, too, that this opinion of yours tends to the injury of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, for the latter did not say, <q>with the Name of the Father and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,</q> but in the Name, and yet not any office but the power of the Trinity is expressed in this syllable,</p>

<p>73. Lastly, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is not a syllable which prejudices <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which commends a syllable, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also speaks in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Christ is not less, because <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> spoke in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as you find: <q>We speak before God in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341096"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:17</a></span> As, then, the Apostle says that we speak in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so, too, is that which we speak in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; as the Apostle himself said: <q>No man says Lord Jesus, except in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341097"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:3</a></span> So, then, in this place not any subjection of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but a connection of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is signified.</p>

<p>74. And that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that distinction does not depend upon a syllable, he says also in another place: <q>And these indeed were you, but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the Name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of our God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341098"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:11</a></span> How many instances of this I can bring forward. For it is written: <q>You are all one in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341099"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse28">Galatians&nbsp;3:28</a></span> and elsewhere: <q>To those sanctified in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341100"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:2</a></span> and again: <q>That we might be the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341101"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse21">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:21</a></span> and in another place: <q>Should fall from the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341102"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3</a></span> </p>

<p>75. But what am I doing? For while I say that like things are written of the Son as of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, I am rather leading on to this, not that because it is written of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, therefore it would appear to be reverently written of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but that because the same is written of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, therefore men allege that the Son's <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is lessened because of the Spirit. For say they, Is it written of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father?</p>

<p>76. But let them learn that it is also said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father: <q>In the Lord I will praise the word;</q>  and elsewhere: <q>In God we will do mighty <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>;</q>  and <q>My remembrance shall be ever in You;</q>  and <q>In Your Name will we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>;</q>  and again in another place: <q>That his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> may be manifested, that they are wrought in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341107"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse21">John&nbsp;3:21</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: <q>In God Who created all things;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341108"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse9">Ephesians&nbsp;3:9</a></span> and again: <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Silvanus and Timotheus to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Thessalonians in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341109"><a href="../bible/2th001.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;1:2</a></span> and in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>I in the Father and the Father in Me,</q> and <q>the Father that dwells in Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341110"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;14:10</a></span> It is also written: <q>He that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> let him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341111"><a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:17</a></span> and in another place: <q>Our life is hid with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341112"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse3">Colossians&nbsp;3:3</a></span> Did he here ascribe more to the Son than to the Father in saying that we are with Christ in God? Or does our state avail more than the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, so that we can be with Christ and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> cannot? And when Christ wills to be with us, as He Himself said: <q>Father, I will that they whom You have given Me be with Me where I am,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341113"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;17:24</a></span> would He disdain to be with the Spirit? For it is written: <q>You coming together and my spirit with the power of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341114"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:4</a></span> Do we then come together in the power of the Lord, and dare to say that the Lord Jesus would not be willing to come together with the Spirit Who does not disdain to come together with us?</p>

<p>77. So the Apostle thinks that it makes no difference which particle you use. For each is a conjunctive particle, and conjunction does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> separation, for if it divided it would not be called a conjunction.</p>

<p>78. What, then, moves you to say that to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father or to His Christ there is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, life, greatness, or power, <em>in</em> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and to refuse to say <em>with</em> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? Is it that you are afraid of seeming to join the Spirit with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>? But hear what is written of the Spirit: <q>For the law of the Spirit is life in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341115"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;8:2</a></span> And in another place <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father says: <q>They shall worship You, and in You they shall make supplication.</q>  <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father says that we ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in Christ; and do you think that it is any derogation to the Spirit if the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Christ is said to be in Him?</p>

<p>79. Hear that what you are afraid to acknowledge of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the Apostle did not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to claim for himself; for he says: <q>To be dissolved and to be with Christ is much better.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341117"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse23">Philippians&nbsp;1:23</a></span> Do you deny that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, through Whom the Apostle was made worthy of being with Christ, is with Christ?</p>

<p>80. What, then, is the reason that you prefer saying that God or Christ is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> rather than with the Spirit? Is it because if you say in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the Spirit is declared to be less than Christ? Although your making the Lord greater or less is a matter which can be refuted, yet since we read, <q>For Christ was made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for us, that we might be the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341118"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse21">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:21</a></span> He is found chiefest in Whom we are found most low. So, too, elsewhere you read, <q>For in Him all things consist,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341119"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse17">Colossians&nbsp;1:17</a></span> that is, in His power. And the things which consist in Him cannot be compared to Him, because they receive from His power the substance whereby they consist.</p>

<p>81. Do you then understand that God so reigns in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> that the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as a kind of source of substance, imparts to God the origin of His rule? But this is impious. And so our predecessors  spoke of the unity of power of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, when they said that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, that they might declare their inseparable connection.</p>

<p>82. For how is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> separated from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, since <q>the Spirit Himself bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> with our spirit that we are sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and if sons, also heirs, heirs, indeed, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and joint-heirs with Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341121"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse16">Romans&nbsp;8:16-17</a></span> Who, then, is so foolish as to wish to dissever the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> conjunction of the Spirit and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when the Spirit by Whom we are made joint-heirs with Christ conjoins even what is severed.</p>

<p>83. <q>If so be,</q> he says, <q>we suffer with Him, that we may be also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> together.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341122"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse16">Romans&nbsp;8:16-17</a></span> If we then shall be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> together with Christ through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, how do we refuse to admit that the Spirit Himself is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> together with Christ? Do we dissociate the life of Christ and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> when the Spirit says that we shall live together with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? For the Apostle says: <q>If we be dead with Christ we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we shall also live with Him;</q> and then again: <q>For if we suffer with Him we shall also live with Him, and not only shall we live with Him, but shall be also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> with Him, and not only be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> but shall also reign with Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341123"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:11-12</a></span> </p>

<p>84. No division, then, is implied in those particles, for each is a particle of conjunction. And lastly, we often find in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture the one inserted and the other understood, as it is written: <q>I will enter into Your house in whole burnt-offerings,</q>  that is, <q>with whole burnt-offerings;</q> and in another place: <q>He brought them forth in silver and gold,</q>  that is, <q>with silver and gold.</q> And elsewhere the Psalmist says: <q>Will You not go forth with us in our hosts?</q>  for that which is really meant, <q>with our hosts.</q> So, then, in the use of the expression no lessening of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> can be implied, and nothing ought to be deduced derogatory to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Godhead, it is necessary that with the heart man should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> unto righteousness, and that out of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the heart confession should be made in the mouth unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not with the heart spread what is derogatory with their mouth.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.</h2>

<p> <em>A passage of St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> abused by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, to prove a distinction between the Divine Persons, is explained, and it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the whole passage can be rightly said of each Person, though it refers specially to the Son. It is then <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that each member of the passage is applicable to each Person, and as to say</em>, of Him are all things <em>is applicable to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, so may</em> all things are through Him and in Him <em>also be said of Him.</em></p>

<p>85. Another similar passage is that which they say implies difference, where it is written: <q>But to us there is one Father, of Whom are all things and we unto Him, and one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, through Whom are all things, and we through Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341127"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:6</a></span> For they pretend that when it is said <q>of Him,</q> the matter is signified, when <q>through Him,</q> either the instrument of the work or some office, but when it is said <q>in Him,</q> either the place or the time in which all things that are made are seen.</p>

<p>86. So, then, their desire is to prove that there is some difference of substance, being anxious to make a distinction between as it were the instrument, and the proper worker or author, and also between time or place and the instrument. But is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, then, alien as regards His Nature from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because an instrument is alien from the worker or author? Or is the Son alien from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, because either time or place is not of the same class as an instrument?</p>

<p>87. Compare now our assertions. They will have it that matter is of God as though of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as when you say that a chest is made of wood or a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of stone; that after this fashion matter has come forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that the same matter has been made by the Son as if by some sort of instrument; so that they declare that the Son is not so much the Artificer as the instrument of the work; and that all things have been made in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as if in some place or time; they attribute each part severally to each Person severally and deny that all are in common.</p>

<p>88. But we show that all things are so of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father has suffered no loss because all things are either through Him or in Him, and yet all things are not of Him as if of matter; then, too, that all things are through the Lord the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, so that He is not deprived of the attribute that all things are of the Son and in Him; and that all things are in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, so that we may teach that all things are through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and all things from the Spirit.</p>

<p>89. For these particles, like those of which we have spoken before, imply each other. For the Apostle did not so say, All things are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and all things are through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as to signify that the substance of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> could be severed, but that he might teach that by a distinction without confusion the Father is one, the Son another. Those particles, then, are not as it were in opposition to each other, but are as it were allied and agreed, so as often to suit even one Person, as it is written: <q>For of Him, and through Him, and in Him are all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341128"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse36">Romans&nbsp;11:36</a></span> </p>

<p>90. But if you really consider whence the passage is taken you will have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it is said of the Son. For the Apostle says, according to the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Isaiah, <q>Who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the mind of the Lord, or who has been His counsellor?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341129"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;40:13</a></span> And he adds: <q>For of Him and in Him are all things.</q> Which Isaiah had said of the Artificer of all, as you read: <q>Who has measured out the water with his hand, and the heaven with a span, and all the earth with his closed hand? Who has placed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance? Who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the mind of the Lord, or who has been His counsellor?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341130"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;40:12</a></span> </p>

<p>91. And the Apostle added: <q>For of Him, and through Him, and in Him are all things.</q> What is <q>of Him</q>? That the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of everything is of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and He is the Author of all things which have come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">being</a>. <q>Through Him</q> means what? That the establishment and continuance of all things is His gift. What is <q>in Him</q>? That all things by a wonderful kind of longing and unspeakable <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> look upon the Author of their life, and the Giver of their graces and functions, according to that which is written: <q>The eyes of all look unto You,</q> and <q>You open Your hand and fillest every living creature with Your good pleasure.</q> </p>

<p>92. And of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, too, you may rightly say <q>of Him,</q> for of Him was the operative Wisdom, Which of His own and the Father's will gave being to all things which were not. <q>Through Him,</q> because all things were made through His Wisdom. <q>In Him,</q> because He is the Fount of substantial Life, in Whom we live and move and have our being.</p>

<p>93. Of the Spirit also, as being formed by Him, strengthened by Him, established in Him, we receive the gift of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</p>

<p>94. Since, then, these expressions seem suitable either to the Father or the Son or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, it is certain that nothing derogatory is spoken of in them, since we both say that many things are of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and many through the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as you find it said of the Son: <q>That we may be increased through all things in Him, Who is Christ the Head, from Whom,</q> says he, <q>the whole body, framed and knit together through every joint of the supply for the measure of every part, makes increase of the body unto the building up of itself in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341132"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse15">Ephesians&nbsp;4:15-16</a></span> And again, writing to the Colossians of those who have not the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, he says: <q>Because they hold not the Head, from Whom all the body being supplied and joined together through joints and bands, increases to the increase of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341133"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse19">Colossians&nbsp;2:19</a></span> For we said above that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And in another place you read: <q>Of His fullness have all we received.</q>  And the Lord Himself said: <q>He shall take of Mine and show it unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341135"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;16:14</a></span> And before, He said: <q>I perceive that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is gone out of Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341136"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;8:46</a></span> </p>

<p>95. In like manner that you may recognize the Unity, it is also said of the Spirit: <q>For he that sows in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> shall of the Spirit reap <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341137"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;6:8</a></span> And John says: <q>Hereby we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He is in us because He has given us of His Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341138"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:13</a></span> And the Angel says: <q>That Which shall be born of her is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341139"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;1:20</a></span> And the Lord says: <q>That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341140"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;3:6</a></span> </p>

<p>96. So, then, as we read that all things are of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, so, too, that all things can be said to be of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, through Whom are all things; and we are taught by <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that all things are of the Spirit in Whom are all things.</p>

<p>97. Now let us consider whether we can teach that anything is through the Father. But it is written: <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the servant of Christ through the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341141"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:1</a></span> and elsewhere: <q>Wherefore you are now not a servant but a son, and if a son an heir also through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341142"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse7">Galatians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> and again: <q>As Christ rose from the dead by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341143"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;6:4</a></span> And elsewhere <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father says to the Son: <q>Behold proselytes shall come to You through Me.</q> </p>

<p>98. You will find many other passages, if you look for things done through the Father. Is, then, the Father less because we read that many things are in the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and find in the heavenly Scriptures very many things done or given through the Father?</p>

<p>99. But in like manner we also read of many things done through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as you find: <q>But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341145"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:10</a></span> and in another place: <q>Keep the good deposit through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341146"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:20</a></span> and to the Ephesians: <q>to be strengthened through His Spirit;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341147"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse16">Ephesians&nbsp;3:16</a></span> and to the Corinthians: <q>To another is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341148"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:8</a></span> and in another place: <q>But if through the Spirit ye mortify the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the flesh, you shall live;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341149"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;8:13</a></span> and above: <q>He Who raised Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies through the indwelling of His Spirit in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341150"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;8:11</a></span> </p>

<p>100. But perhaps some one may say, Show me that we can read expressly that all things are of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or that all things are of the Spirit. But I reply, Let them also show that it is written that all things are through the Father. But since we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that these expressions suit either the Father or the Son or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and that no distinction of the divine power can arise from particles of this kind, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that all things are of Him through Whom all things are; and that all things are through Him through Whom all are; and that we must understand that all things are through Him or of Him in Whom all are. For every creature exists both of the will, and through the operation and in the power of the Trinity, as it is written: <q>Let Us make man after Our image and likeness;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341151"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> and elsewhere: <q>By the word of the Lord were the heavens established, and all their power by the Spirit of His mouth.</q> </p>

<p>Being about to prove that the will, the calling, and the commandment of the Trinity is one, St. Ambrose shows that the Spirit called the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> exactly as the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> did, and proves this by the selection of SS. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>, and especially by the mission of St. Peter to Cornelius. And by the way he points out how in the Apostle's vision the calling of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> was shadowed forth, who having been before like wild beasts, now by the operation of the Spirit lay aside that wildness. Then having quoted other passages in support of this view, he shows that in the case of Jeremiah cast into a pit by <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and rescued by Abdemelech, is a type of the slighting of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and of His being honoured by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</p>

<p>101. And not only is the operation of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> everywhere one but also there is one and the same will, calling, and giving of commands, which one may see in the great and saving <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For as the Father called the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, saying: <q>I will call her My people which was not My people, and her beloved who was not beloved;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341153"><a href="../bible/hos002.htm#verse23">Hosea&nbsp;2:23</a></span> and elsewhere: <q>My house shall be called a house of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for all nations,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341154"><a href="../bible/isa056.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;56:7</a></span> so, too, the Lord Jesus said that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was chosen by Him to call forth and gather together the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as you find it said by the Lord Jesus to Ananias: <q>Go, for he is a chosen vessel unto Me to bear My name before all nations.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341155"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;9:15</a></span> </p>

<p>102. As, then, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father called the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so, too, Christ called it, and so, too, the Spirit called it, saying: <q>Separate Me <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> for the work to which I have called them.</q> <q>So,</q> it is added, <q>having fasted and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, they laid hands on them and sent them forth. And they, being sent forth by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, went down to Seleucia.</q>  So <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> received the apostleship  by the will not only of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but also of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and hastened to gather together the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</p>

<p>103. And not only <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, but also, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles, Peter. For when he had seen in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> heaven opened and a certain vessel tied at the four corners, as it were a sheet in which were all kinds of four-footed beasts and wild beasts and fowls of the air, <q>a voice came to him saying, Arise, Peter, kill and eat. And Peter said, Be it far from me, Lord, I have never eaten anything common or unclean. And again a voice came to him, saying, What God has cleansed, call not common. And this was done three times, and the vessel was received back into heaven.</q>  And so when Peter was silently thinking over this with himself, and the servants of Cornelius appointed by the Angel had come to him, the Spirit said to him, <q>Lo, men are seeking you, rise therefore, and go down and go with them; <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not, for I have sent you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341158"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse19">Acts&nbsp;10:19-20</a></span> </p>

<p>104. How clearly did the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> express His own power! First of all in that He inspired him who was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, and was present to him who was entreating; then when Peter, being called, answered, <q>Lord,</q> and so was found worthy of a second message, because he acknowledged the Lord. But the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> declares Who that Lord was, for He Whom he had answered spoke to him when he answered. And the following words show the Spirit clearly revealed, for He Who formed the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>.</p>

<p>105. Notice, also, that the appearance of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> three times repeated expressed the operation of the Trinity. And so in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>  the threefold question is put, and the threefold answer made, and no one can be cleansed but by a threefold confession. For which reason, also, Peter in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is asked three times whether he loves the Lord, that by the threefold answer the bonds of the guilt he had contracted by denying the Lord might be loosed.</p>

<p>106. Then, again, because the Angel is sent to Cornelius, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> speaks to Peter: <q>For the eyes of the Lord are over the faithful of the earth.</q>  Nor is it without a purpose that when He had said before, <q>What God has cleansed call not thou common,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341161"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;10:15</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> came upon the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to purify them, when it is manifest that the operation of the Spirit is a divine operation. But Peter, when sent by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, did not wait for the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but acknowledged that that message was from the Spirit Himself, and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that of the Spirit Himself, when he said: <q>If, then, God has granted them the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as to us, who was I that I should resist God?</q></p>

<p>107. It is, then, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> Who has delivered us from that Gentile impurity. For in those kinds of four-footed creatures and wild beasts and birds there was a figure of the condition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which appears clothed with the bestial ferocity of wild beasts unless it grows gentle by the sanctification of the Spirit. Excellent, then, is that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which changes the rage of beasts into the simplicity of the Spirit: <q>For we also were aforetime foolish, unbelieving, erring, serving various <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> and pleasures. But now by the renewing of the Spirit we begin to be heirs of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and joint-heirs with the Angels.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341162"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse3">Titus&nbsp;3:3-7</a></span> </p>

<p>108. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> David, seeing in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> that we should from wild beasts become like the dwellers in heaven, says, <q>Rebuke the wild beasts of the wood,</q>  evidently signifying, not the wood disturbed by the running of wild beasts, and shaken with the roaring of animals, but that wood of which it is written: <q>We found it in the fields of the wood.</q>  In which, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: <q>The righteous shall flourish as the palm-tree, and shall be multiplied as the cedar which is in Libanus.</q>  That wood which, shaken in the tops of the trees spoken of in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, shed forth the nourishment of the heavenly Word. That wood into which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> entered indeed as a ravening wolf, but went forth as a shepherd, for <q>their sound is gone out into all the earth.</q> </p>

<p>109. We then were wild beasts, and therefore the Lord said: <q>Beware of <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, which come in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341167"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;7:15</a></span> But now, through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the rage of lions, the spots of leopards, the craft of foxes, the rapacity of wolves, have passed away from our feelings; great, then, is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which has changed earth to heaven, that the conversation of us, who once were wandering as wild beasts in the woods, might be in heaven. <span class="stiki" id="note341168"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse20">Philippians&nbsp;3:20</a></span> </p>

<p>110. And not only in this place, but also elsewhere in the same book, the Apostle Peter declared that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was built by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For you read that he said: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the hearts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, bore witness, giving them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, even as also to us; and He made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341169"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse8">Acts&nbsp;15:8-9</a></span> In which is to be considered, that as Christ is the Cornerstone, Who joined together both peoples into one, so, too, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> made no distinction between the hearts of each people, but united them.</p>

<p>111. Do not, then, like a Jew, despise the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, Whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> foretold; for you would despise also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, you would despise Isaiah, you would despise Jeremiah, whom he who was chosen of the Lord raised with rags and cords from the pit of that Jewish abode. <span class="stiki" id="note341170"><a href="../bible/jer038.htm#verse11">Jeremiah&nbsp;38:11</a></span> For the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, despising the word of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, had cast him into the pit. Nor was there found any one of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to draw the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> out, but one <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a> Abdemelech, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> testifies.</p>

<p>112. In which account is a very beautiful figure, that is to say, that we, sinners of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, black beforehand through our transgressions, and aforetime fruitless, raised from the depth the word of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had thrust down, as it were, into the mire of their mind and carnality. And therefore it is written: <q><a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> shall stretch out her hand unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  In which is signified the appearance of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, who says in the Song of Songs: <q>I am black and comely, O daughters of Jerusalem;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341172"><a href="../bible/son001.htm#verse5">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;1:5</a></span> black through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, comely through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; black by natural condition, comely through redemption, or certainly, black with the dust of her labours. So she is black while fighting, is comely when she is crowned with the ornaments of victory.</p>

<p>113. And fittingly is the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> raised by cords, for the faithful writer said: <q>The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places.</q>  And fittingly with rags; for the Lord Himself, when those who had been first invited to the marriage made excuse, sent to the partings of the highways, that as many as were found, both bad and good, should be invited to the marriage. With these rags, then, He lifted the word of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> from the mire.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p>We shall follow the example of Abdemelech, if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things. This <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is attributed in Scripture to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and also to the Son. The Son is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as also the Spirit by the Son. Also, inasmuch as we read that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Spirit say and reveal the same things, we must acknowledge in Them a oneness of nature and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Lastly, that the Spirit searches the deep things of God is not a mark of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, since the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are likewise said to search, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, although chosen by Christ, yet was taught by the Spirit.</p>

<p>114. And you, too, shall be Abdemelech,  that is, chosen by the Lord, if you raise the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> from the depth of Gentile <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is not deceived, that nothing escapes His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that He is not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what is going to be. And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also is not deceived, of Whom the Lord says: <q>But when He, the Spirit of Truth, shall come, He shall lead you into all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341175"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;16:13</a></span> He Who says <em>all</em> passes by nothing, neither the day nor the hour, neither things past nor things to come.</p>

<p>115. And that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things, and foretells things to come, and that His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is one with that of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, hear what the Truth of God says concerning Him: <q>For He shall not speak from Himself, but what things He shall hear shall He speak, and He shall declare unto you the things that are to come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341176"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;16:13</a></span> </p>

<p>116. Therefore, that you may observe that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things, when the Son said: <q>But of that day and hour <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no one, not even the Angels of heaven,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341177"><a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse32">Mark&nbsp;13:32</a></span> He excepted the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But if the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is excepted from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, how is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> not excepted?</p>

<p>117. But you say that He numbered the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> also with the Angels. He numbered the Son indeed, but He did not number the Spirit also. Confess, then, either that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, so as to speak now not only as an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, but even as a Photinian,  or acknowledge to what you ought to refer it that He said that the Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not. For as man He could [in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>] be numbered with creatures Who were created.</p>

<p>118. But if you are willing to learn that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things, and has foreknowledge of all, see that those very things which you think to be unknown to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> received from the Son. He received them, however, through Unity of Substance, as the Son received from the Father. <q>He,</q> says He, <q>shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall declare it unto you. All things whatsoever the Father has are Mine, therefore said I, He shall receive of Mine, and shall declare it unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341179"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;16:14-15</a></span> What, then, is more clear than this Unity? What things the Father has pertain to the Son; what things the Son has the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also has received.</p>

<p>119. Yet learn that the Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the day of judgment. We read in Zechariah: <q>And the Lord my God shall come, and all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> with Him. In that day there shall not be light, but cold and frost, and it shall be one day, and that day is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto the Lord.</q>  This day, then, was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto the Lord, Who shall come with His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, to enlighten us by His second Advent.</p>

<p>120. But let us continue the point which we have commenced concerning the Spirit. For in the passage we have brought forward you find that the Son says of the Spirit: <q>He shall glorify Me.</q> So, then, the Spirit glorifies the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as the Father also glorifies Him, but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> also glorifies the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as we said above. He, then, is not weak who is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the mutual <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> through the Unity of the Eternal Light, nor is He inferior to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, of Whom this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that He is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the Spirit.</p>

<p>122. And you too shall be chosen, if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Spirit spoke that which the Father spoke, and which the Son spoke. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in fine, was therefore chosen because he so <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and so taught, since, as it is written, God <q>has revealed to us by His Spirit that which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has entered into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has prepared for them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341181"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:9-10</a></span> And therefore is He called the Spirit of revelation, as you read: <q>For God gives to those who thus prepare themselves the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, that He may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341182"><a href="../bible/isa064.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;64:4</a></span> </p>

<p>123. There is, then, a Unity of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, since, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who gives the Spirit of revelation, reveals, so also the Son reveals, for it is written: <q>No one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Son save the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, neither does any one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father save the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he to whom the Son shall will to reveal Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341183"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span> He said more concerning the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, not because He has more than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but lest He should be supposed to have less. And not unfittingly is the Father thus revealed by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, for the Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father even as the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Son.</p>

<p>124. Learn now that the Spirit too <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for it is written that, <q>As no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, save the spirit which is in him, so too the things of God no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> save the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</q> <q>No one,</q> he says, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> save the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341184"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> Is, then, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> excluded? Certainly not, since neither is the Spirit excluded, when it is said: <q>And none <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, save the Son.</q></p>

<p>125. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are of one nature and of one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And the Spirit is not to be numbered with all things which were made by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, since He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Whom (as it is written) who can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> save the Son? But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also. What then? When the totality of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things is spoken of, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not included.</p>

<p>126. Now I should like them to answer what it is in man which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Certainly that must be reasonable which surpasses the other powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and by which the highest nature of man is estimated. What, then, is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the deep things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and through Whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> is revealed? Is He inferior in the fullness of the Godhead Who is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> even by this instance to be of one substance with the Father? Or is He <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of anything Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the counsels of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> which have been hidden  from the beginning? What is there that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things that are of God? For <q>the Spirit searches even the deep things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341186"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:10</a></span> </p>

<p>127. But lest you should think that He searches things unknown, and so searches that He may learn that which He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not, it is stated first that God revealed them to us through His Spirit, and at the same time in order that you may learn that the Spirit <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things which are revealed to us through the Spirit Himself, it is said subsequently: <q>For who among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, save the spirit of the man which is in him? So, too, the things of God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no one save the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341187"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> If, then, the spirit of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them before it searches, can there be anything of God which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not? Of Whom the Apostle said not without a purpose, <q>The things of God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no one, save the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>;</q> not that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by searching, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by nature; not that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of divine things is an accident in Him, but is His natural <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>128. But if this moves you that He said <q>searches,</q> learn that this is also said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as He is the searcher of hearts and reins. For Himself said: <q>I am He that searches the heart and reins.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341188"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse10">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:10</a></span> And of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> you have also in the Epistle to the Hebrews: <q>Who is the Searcher of the mind and thoughts.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341189"><a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse12">Hebrews&nbsp;4:12</a></span> Whence it is clear that no inferior searches the inward things of his superior, for to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> hidden things is of the divine power alone. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, then, is a searcher in like manner as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Son is a searcher in like manner, by the proper signification of which expression this is implied, that evidently there is nothing which He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not, Whom nothing escapes.</p>

<p>129. Lastly, he was chosen by Christ, and taught by the Spirit. For as he himself witnesses, having obtained through the Spirit <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the divine secrets, he shows both that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and has revealed to us the things which are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the Son also has revealed them. And he adds: <q>But we received, not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things that are given to us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which we also speak, not in persuasive words of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> wisdom, but in manifestation of the Spirit and in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341190"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:12-13</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p>After <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the Spirit is the Giver of revelation equally with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, it is explained how the same Spirit does not speak of Himself; and it is shown that no bodily organs are to be thought of in Him, and that no inferiority is to be supposed from the fact of our reading that He hears, since the same would have to be attributed to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and indeed even to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, since He hears the Son. The Spirit then hears and glorifies the Son in the sense that He revealed Him to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, by which the Unity of operation of the Three Persons is inferred; and, since the Spirit does the same works as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the substance of each is also declared to be the same.</p>

<p>130. It has then been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that like as God has revealed to us the things which are His, so too the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and so too the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, has revealed the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> proceeds from one Spirit, through one Son to one Father; and from one Father through one Son to one <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is delivered goodness and sanctification and the sovereign right of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power. Where, then, there is a manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, there is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor can there be any distinction where the work is one. And therefore that which the Son says the Father also says, and that which the Father says the Son also says, and that which the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> say the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also says.</p>

<p>131. Whence also the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> said concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>: <q>He shall not speak from Himself,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341191"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;16:13</a></span> that is, not without the participation of the Father and Myself. For the Spirit is not divided and separated, but speaks what He hears. He hears, that is to say, by unity of substance and by the property of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For He receives not hearing by any orifices of the body, nor does the divine voice resound with any carnal measures, nor does He hear what He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not; since commonly in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> matters hearing produces <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and yet not even in men themselves is there always bodily speech or fleshly hearing. For <q>he that speaks in tongues,</q> it is said, <q>speaks not to men but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for no one hears, but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> he speaks <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341192"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:2</a></span> </p>

<p>132. Therefore if in men hearing is not always of the body, do you require in God the voices of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> weakness, and certain organs of fleshly hearing, when He is said to hear in order that we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>? For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that which we have heard, and we hear beforehand that we may be able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; but in God Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> goes before hearing. So in order to state that the Son is not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what the Father wills, we say that He has heard; but in God there is no sound nor syllable, such as usually signify the indication of the will; but oneness of will is comprehended in hidden ways in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in us is shown by signs.</p>

<p>133. What means, then, <q>He shall not speak from Himself</q>? This is, He shall not speak without Me; for He speaks the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, He breathes wisdom. He speaks not without the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for He is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>; He hears not from Himself, for all things are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>134. The Son received all things from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for He Himself said: <q>All things have been delivered unto Me from My Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341193"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span> All that is the Father's the Son also has, for He says again: <q>All things which the Father has are Mine.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341194"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;15:15</a></span> And those things which He Himself received by Unity of nature, the Spirit by the same Unity of nature received also from Him, as the Lord Jesus Himself declares, when speaking of His Spirit: <q>Therefore said I, He shall receive of Mine and shall declare it unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341195"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;15:15</a></span> Therefore what the Spirit says is the Son's, what the Son has given is the Father's. So neither the Son nor the Spirit speaks anything of Himself. For the Trinity speaks nothing external to Itself.</p>

<p>135. But if you contend that this is an argument for the weakness of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and for a kind of likeness to the lowliness of the body, you will also make it an argument to the injury of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because the Son said of Himself: <q>As I hear I judge,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341196"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;5:30</a></span> and <q>The Son can do nothing else than what He sees the Father doing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341197"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;5:19</a></span> For if that be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as it is, which the Son said: <q>All things which the Father has are Mine,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341198"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;16:15</a></span> and the Son according to the Godhead is One with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, One by natural substance, not according to the Sabellian  <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>; that which is one by the property of substance certainly cannot be separated, and so the Son cannot do anything except what He has heard of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> endures forever,  nor is the Father ever separated from the operation of the Son; and that which the Son works He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that the Father wills, and what the Father wills the Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to work.</p>

<p>136. Lastly, that one may not think that there is any difference of work either in time or in order between the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the oneness of the same operation, He says: <q>The works which I do He does.</q>  And again, that one may not think that there is any difference in the distinction of the works, but may judge that the will, the working, and the power of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are the same, Wisdom says concerning the Father: <q>For whatsoever things He does, the Son likewise does the same.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341202"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;5:19</a></span> So that the action of neither Person is before or after that of the Other, but the same result of one operation. And for this reason the Son says that He can do nothing of Himself, because His operation cannot be separated from that of the Father. In like manner the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not separated. Whence also the things which He speaks, He is said to hear from the Father.</p>

<p>137. What if I demonstrate that the Father also hears the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as the Son too hears the Father? For you have it written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that the Son says: <q>Father, I thank You that You heard Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341203"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse41">John&nbsp;11:41</a></span> How did the Father hear the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, since in the previous passage concerning Lazarus the Son spoke nothing to the Father? And that we might not think that the Son was heard once by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He added: <q>And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that You hear Me always.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341204"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse42">John&nbsp;11:42</a></span> Therefore the hearing is not that of subject <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Unity.</p>

<p>138. In like manner, then, the Spirit is said to hear from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and to glorify the Son. To glorify, because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> taught us that the Son is the Image of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note341205"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse15">Colossians&nbsp;1:15</a></span> and the brightness of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the impress of His substance. <span class="stiki" id="note341206"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews&nbsp;1:3</a></span> The Spirit also spoke in the patriarchs and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and, lastly, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> began then to be more perfect after that they had received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. There is therefore no separation of the divine power and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for although <q>there are diversities of gifts, yet it is the same Spirit; and diversities of ministrations, yet the same Lord; and diversities of operations, yet the same God Who works all in all.</q>  There are diversities of offices, not severances of the Trinity.</p>

<p>139. Lastly, it is the same God Who works all in all, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is no diversity of operation between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; since those things which the Spirit works, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father also works, <q>Who works all in all.</q> For while <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father works all in all, yet <q>to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to the same Spirit; to another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in the same Spirit; to another the gift of healings, in the one Spirit; to another the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; to another <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; to another discerning of spirits; to another various kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of sayings; but all these works one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one as He will.</q> </p>

<p>140. There is then no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that those things which the Father works, the Spirit works also. Nor does He work in accordance with a command, as he who hears in bodily fashion, but voluntarily, as being free in His own will, not the servant of the power of another. For He does not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> as being bidden, but as the giver He is the controller of His own gifts.</p>

<p>141. Consider meanwhile whether you can say that the Spirit effects all things which the Father effects; for you cannot deny that the Father effects those things which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> effects; otherwise the Father does not effect all things, if He effects not those things which the Spirit also effects. But if the Father also effects those things which the Spirit effects, since the Spirit divides His operations, according to His own will, you must of necessity say, either that what the Spirit divides He divides according to His own will, against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father; or if you say that the Father wills the same that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> wills, you must of necessity confess the oneness of the divine will and operation, even if you do it unwillingly, and, if not with the heart, at least with the mouth.</p>

<p>142. But if the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is of one will and operation with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He is also of one substance, since the Creator is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by His works. So, then, it is the same Spirit, he says, the same Lord, the same God. <span class="stiki" id="note341209"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:5</a></span> And if you say Spirit, He is the same; and if you say Lord, He is the same; and if you say <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He is the same. Not the same, so that Himself is Father, Himself Son, Himself Spirit [one and the selfsame Person]; but because both the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are the same Power. He is, then, the same in substance and in power, for there is not in the Godhead either the confusion of Sabellius nor the division of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, nor any earthly and bodily change.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.</h2>

<p>Prophecy was not only from the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> but also from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; the authority and operation of the latter on the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> is signified to be the same as Theirs; and so we are to understand that there is unity in the three points of authority, rule, and bounty; yet need no disadvantage be feared from that participation, since such does not arise in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> friendship. Lastly, it is established that this is the inheritance of the apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from the fact that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> are described as having <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>143. Take, O sacred Emperor, another strong instance in this question, and one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you: <q>In many ways and in various manners, God spoke to the fathers in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341210"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse1">Hebrews&nbsp;1:1</a></span> And the Wisdom of God said: <q>I will send <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341211"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;11:49</a></span> And <q>To one is given,</q> as it is written, <q>through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the word of wisdom; to another, the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to the same Spirit; to another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in the same Spirit; to another, the gift of healings, in the one Spirit; to another, the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; to another, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.</q>  Therefore, according to the Apostle, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is not only through the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but also through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and therefore the office is one, and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> one. So you find that the Spirit also is the author of prophecies.</p>

<p>144. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> also said: <q>It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and to us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341213"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse28">Acts&nbsp;15:28</a></span> And when they say, <q>It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>,</q> they point out not only the Worker of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but also the Author of the carrying out of that which was commanded. For as we read of God: <q>It pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> so, too, when it is said that, <q>It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,</q> one who is master of his own power is portrayed.</p>

<p>145. And how should He not be a master Who speaks what He wills, and commands what He wills, as the Father commands and the Son commands? For as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> heard the voice saying to him, <q>I am Jesus, Whom you persecute,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341214"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse5">Acts&nbsp;9:5</a></span> so, too, the Spirit forbade <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Silas to go into Bithynia. And as the Father spoke through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, so, too, <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a> says concerning the Spirit: <q>Thus says the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, Thus shall the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in Jerusalem bind the man, whose is this girdle.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341215"><a href="../bible/act021.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;21:11</a></span> And as Wisdom sent the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, saying, <q>Go ye into all the world and preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341216"><a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse15">Mark&nbsp;16:15</a></span> so, too, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> says: <q>Separate Me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341217"><a href="../bible/act013.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;13:2</a></span> And so being sent forth by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> points out farther on, they were distinguished in nothing from the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, as though they were sent in one way by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in another way by Spirit.</p>

<p>146. Lastly, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> having been sent by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, was both a vessel of election on Christ's part, and himself relates that God wrought in him, saying: <q>For He that wrought for Peter unto the apostleship of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, wrought for me also unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341218"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> Since, then, the Same wrought in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> Who wrought in Peter, it is certainly evident that, since the Spirit wrought in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> wrought also in Peter. But Peter himself testifies that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father wrought in him, as it is stated in the Acts of the Apostles that Peter rose up and said to them: <q>Men and brethren, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that a good while ago God made choice among us that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> should hear the word of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> from my mouth.</q> See, then, in Peter God wrought the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of preaching. And who would dare to deny the operation of Christ in him, since he was certainly elected and chosen by Christ, when the Lord said: <q>Feed My lambs.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341219"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;21:15</a></span> </p>

<p>147. The operation, then, of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is one, unless perchance you, who deny the oneness of the same operation upon the Apostle, think this; that the Father and the Spirit wrought in Peter, in whom the Son had wrought, as if the operation of the Son by no means sufficed for him to the attainment of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And so the strength of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> being as it were joined and brought together, the work was manifold, lest the operation of Christ alone should be too weak to establish Peter.</p>

<p>148. And not only in Peter is there found to be one operation of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but also in all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> the unity of the divine operation, and a certain authority over the dispensations of heaven. For the divine operation works by the power of a command, not in the execution of a ministry; for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He works, does not fashion anything by toil or art, but <q>He spoke and they were made.</q>  He said, <q>Let there be light, and there was light,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341221"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;1:3</a></span> for the effecting of the work is comprised in the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>149. We can, then, easily find, if we will consider, that this royal power is by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> attributed to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and it will be made clear that all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were not only <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but also ministers of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. As also the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> tells us, when he says: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has set some in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, first <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, secondarily <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, thirdly teachers; then <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, the gift of healings, helps, governments, various kinds of tongues.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341222"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:28</a></span> </p>

<p>150. See, God set <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and set <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and teachers, gave the gift of healings, which you find above to be given by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; gave various kinds of tongues. But yet all are not <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, all are not <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, all are not teachers. Not all, says he, have the gift of healings, nor do all, says he, speak with tongues. <span class="stiki" id="note341223"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse30">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:30</a></span> For the whole of the divine gifts cannot exist in each several man; each, according to his capacity, receives that which he either desires or deserves. But the power of the Trinity, which is lavish of all graces, is not like this weakness.</p>

<p>151. Lastly, God set <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Those whom God set in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Christ chose and ordained to be <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and sent them into the world, saying: <q>Go ye into all the world, and preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to the whole creation. He that shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> shall be saved, but he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. In My Name shall they cast out devils, they shall speak with new tongues, they shall take up serpents, and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them, they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</q>  You see the Father and Christ also set teachers in the Churches; and as the Father gives the gift of healings, so, too, does the Son give; as the Father gives the gift of tongues, so, too, has the Son also granted it.</p>

<p>152. In like manner we have heard also above concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, that He too grants the same kinds of graces. For it is said: <q>To one is given through the Spirit the gift of healings, to another various kinds of tongues, to another <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341225"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:8-9</a></span> So, then, the Spirit gives the same gifts as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Son also gives them. Let us now learn more expressly what we have touched upon above, that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> entrusts the same office as the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and appoints the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; since <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: <q>Take heed to yourselves, and to all the flock in the which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> has made you overseers to rule the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341226"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse28">Acts&nbsp;20:28</a></span> </p>

<p>153. There is, then, unity of authority, unity of appointment, unity of giving. For if you separate appointment and power, what <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> was there [for maintaining] that those whom Christ appointed as <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father appointed, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> appointed? Unless, perhaps, as if sharing a possession or a right, They, like men, were afraid of legal prejudice, and therefore the operation was divided, and the authority distributed.</p>

<p>154. These things are narrow and paltry, even between men, who for the most part, although they do not agree in action, yet agree in will. So that a certain person being asked what a friend is, answered, <q>A second self.</q> If, then, a man so defined a friend as to say, he was a second self, that is to say, through a oneness of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and good-will, how much more ought we to esteem the oneness of Majesty, in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, when by the same operation and divine power, either the unity, or certainly that which is more, the <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C5;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C2;</span>, as it is called in Greek, is expressed, for <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x1F7B;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;</span> signifies <q>the same,</q> so that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> have the same; so that to have the same will and the same power does not arise from the affection of the will, but inheres in the substance of the Trinity.</p>

<p>155. This is the inheritance of apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and devotion, which one may observe also in the Acts of the Apostles. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the commands of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. And all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, and immediately ordained those whom the Spirit had ordered to be separated: <q>Separate Me,</q> said He, <q>Barnabas and Saul.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341227"><a href="../bible/act013.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;13:2</a></span> Do you see the authority of Him Who commands? Consider the merit of those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>.</p>

<p>156. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and because he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> he cast off the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of a persecutor, and gained a crown of righteousness. He <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> who used to make havoc of the Churches; but being <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he preached in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> that which the Spirit commanded. <span class="stiki" id="note341228"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse20">Acts&nbsp;9:20</a></span> The Spirit anointed His champion, and having shaken off the dust of unbelief, presented him as an insuperable conqueror of the unbelievers to various assemblies of the ungodly, and trained him by many sufferings for the prize of his high calling in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</p>

<p>157. Barnabas also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> because he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Therefore, being chosen by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, Which came on him abundantly, as a special sign of his merits, he was not unworthy of so great a fellowship. For one <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> shone in these whom one Spirit had chosen.</p>

<p>158. Nor was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> inferior to Peter, though the latter was the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the former a wise builder <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how to make firm the footsteps of the nations who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was not, I say, unworthy of the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but is easily comparable with the first, and second to none. For he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not that he is inferior makes himself equal.</p>
