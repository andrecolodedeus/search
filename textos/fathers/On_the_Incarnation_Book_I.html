<h1>On the Incarnation (Book I)</h1>

<h2>Preface.</h2>

<p>When I had now finished the books of Spiritual Conferences, the merit of which consists in the thoughts expressed rather than in the language used (since my rude utterances were unequal to the deep thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>), I had contemplated and almost determined on taking refuge in silence (as I was ashamed of having exposed my <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>) that I might as far as possible make up for my audacity in speaking by modestly holding my tongue for the future. But you have overcome my determination and purpose by your commendable earnestness and most urgent affection, my dear Leo, my esteemed and highly regarded friend, ornament that you are of the Roman Church and sacred ministry,  as you drag me forth from the obscurity of the silence on which I had determined, into a public court which I may well dread, and oblige me to undertake new labours while I am still blushing for my past ones. And though I was unequal to lesser tasks, you compel me to match myself with greater ones. For even in those trifling works, in which of our small ability we offered some small offering to the Lord, I would never have attempted to do or apply myself to anything unless I had been led to it by Episcopal command. And so through you there has been an increase of importance both of our subject and of our language. For whereas before we spoke, when bidden, of the business of the Lord, you now require us to speak of the actual Incarnation and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord Himself. And so we who were formerly brought as it were into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place of the temple by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> hands, now penetrate under your guidance and protection, so to speak, into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies. Great is the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> but most perilous the undertaking,  because the prize of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sanctuary and the divine reward can only be secured by a victory over our foe. And so you require and charge us to raise our feeble hands against a fresh <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and a new enemy of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,  and that we should take our stand, so to speak, against the awful open-mouthed gapings of the deadly serpent, that at my summons the power of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and the divine force of the gospel word may destroy the dragon now rising up with sinuous course against the Churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> your intreaty: I yield to your command: for I had rather trust in my own matters to you than to myself, especially as the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> my Lord commands me this as well as you, for He Himself gives me this charge in your person. For in this matter you are more concerned than I am, as your judgment stands in peril rather than my duty. For in my case, whether I prove equal to what you have commanded me or no, the very fact of my <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> and humility will be in some degree an excuse for me; if indeed I might not urge that there is more value in my <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, if there is less that I can do. For we easily comply with any one's orders, out of our abundance: but his is a great and wonderful work, whose desires exceed his powers. Yours then is this work and business, and yours it is to be ashamed of it. Pray and intreat that your choice may not be discredited by my clumsiness; and that, supposing we do not answer the expectations which you have formed of us, you may not seem to have been wrong in commanding out of an ill-considered determination, while I was right in yielding, owing to the claims of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.</h2>

<p><strong>The heresy compared to the hydra of the poets. </strong></p>

<p>The tales of poets tell us that of old the hydra when its heads were cut off gained by its injuries, and sprang up more abundantly: so that owing to a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of a strange and unheard-of kind, its loss <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a kind of gain to the monster which was thus increased by death, while that extraordinary fecundity doubled everything which the knife of the executioner cut off, until the man who was eagerly seeking its destruction, toiling and sweating, and finding his efforts so often baffled by useless labours, added to the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of battle the arts of craft, and by the application of fire, as they tell us, cut off with a fiery sword the manifold offspring of that monstrous body; and so when the inward parts were thus burnt, by cauterizing the rebellious throbbings of that ghastly fecundity, at length those prodigious births were brought to an end. Thus also <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> in the churches bear some likeness to that hydra which the poets' imagination invented; for <em>they</em> too hiss against us with deadly tongues; and <em>they</em> too cast forth their deadly poison, and spring up again when their heads are cut off. But because the medicine should not be wanting when the disease revives, and because the remedy should be the more speedy as the sickness is the more dangerous, our Lord God is able to bring to pass that that may be a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the church's warfare, which Gentile fictions imagined of the death of the hydra, and that the fiery sword of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> may cauterize the inward parts of that most dangerous birth, in the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to be put down, so that at last its monstrous fecundity may cease to answer to its dying throbs.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p><strong>Description of the different heretical monsters which spring from one another.</strong></p>

<p>For these shoots of an unnatural seed are no new thing in the churches. The harvest of the Lord's field has always had to put up with burrs and briars, and in it the shoots of choking tares have constantly sprung up. For hence have arisen the <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, Sabellians, <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, as well as Eunomians and Macedonians, and <a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinians</a> and <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarians</a>, and all the other tares of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and thistles which destroy the fruits of good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And of these the earliest was Ebion,  who while over-anxious about asserting our Lord's humanity  <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> it of its union with Divinity. But after him the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Sabellius burst forth out of reaction against the above mentioned <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and as he declared that there was no distinction between the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he impiously confounded, as far as was possible, the Persons, and failed to distinguish the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ineffable Trinity. Next after him whom we have mentioned there followed the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> perversity, which, in order to avoid the appearance of confounding the Sacred Persons, declared that there were different and dissimilar substances in the Trinity. But after him in time though like him in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> came Eunomius, who, though allowing that the Persons of the Holy Trinity were divine and like  each other, yet insisted that they were separate from each other; and so while admitting their likeness denied their equality. Macedonius also <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> with unpardonable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, while allowing that the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> were of one substance, termed the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> a creature, and so <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the entire Divinity, because no injury can be offered to anything in the Trinity without affecting the entire Trinity. But Photinus, though allowing that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> who was born of the Virgin was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet erred in his notion that His Godhead began with the beginning of His manhood;  while <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a> through inaccurately conceiving the union of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> wrongly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that He was without a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For it is as bad an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to add to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> what does not belong to Him as to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">rob</a> Him of that which is His. For where He is spoken of otherwise than as He is&mdash; even though it seems to add to His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>&mdash; yet it is an offense. And so one after another out of reaction against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> they give rise to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and all teach things different from each other, but equally opposed to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And just lately also, i.e., in our own days, we saw a most poisonous <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> spring up from the greatest city of the Belg&aelig;,  and though there was no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about its <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, yet there was a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about its name, because it arose with a fresh head from the old stock of the <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, and so it is still a question whether it ought to be called old or new. For it was new as far as its upholders were concerned; but old in the character of its <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Indeed it blasphemously taught that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> was born as a mere man, and maintained that the fact that He afterwards obtained the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and power of the Godhead resulted from His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> worth and not from His Divine nature; and by this it taught that He had not always His Divinity by the right of His very own Divine nature which belonged to Him, but that He obtained it afterwards as a reward for His labours and sufferings. Whereas then it blasphemously taught that our Lord and Saviour was not God at His birth, but was subsequently taken into the Godhead, it was indeed bordering on this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which has now sprung up, and is as it were its first cousin and akin to it, and, harmonizing both with Ebionism and these new ones, came in point of time between them, and was linked with them both in point of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. And although there are some others like those which we have mentioned yet it would take too long to describe them all. Nor have we now undertaken to enumerate those that are dead and gone, but to refute those which are novel.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p><strong>He describes the pestilent error of the Pelagian.</strong></p>

<p>At any rate we think that this fact ought not to be omitted, which was special and peculiar to that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> mentioned above which sprang from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Pelagius; viz., that in saying that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> had lived as a mere man without any stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, they actually went so far as to declare that men could also be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if they liked. For they imagined that it followed that if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> being a mere man was without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> also could without the help of God be whatever He as a mere man without participating in the Godhead, could be. And so they made out that there was no difference between any man and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, as any man could by effort and striving obtain just the same as Christ had obtained by His earnestness and efforts. Whence it resulted that they broke out into a more grievous and unnatural <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, and said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> had come into this world not to bring redemption to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> but to give an example of good works, to wit, that men, by following His teaching, and by walking along the same path of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, might arrive at the same reward of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: thus destroying, as far as they could, all the good of His sacred advent and all the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Divine redemption, as they declared that men could by their own lives obtain just that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had wrought by dying for man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. They added as well that our Lord and Saviour became the Christ after His Baptism, and God after His Resurrection, tracing the former to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His anointing, the latter to the merits of His Passion. Whence this new author  of a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> that is not new, who declares that our Lord and Saviour was born a mere man, observes that he says exactly the same thing which the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> said before him, and allows that it follows from his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that as he asserts that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> lived as a mere man entirely without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so he must maintain in his <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> can of themselves be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor would he admit that our Lord's redemption was a thing needful for His example, since men can (as they say) reach the heavenly kingdom by their own exertions. Nor is there any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about this, as the thing itself shows us. For hence it comes that he encourages the complaints of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> by his intervention, and introduces their case into his writings, because he cleverly or (to speak more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>) cunningly patronizes them and by his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> liking for them recommends their mischievous teaching which is akin to his own, for he is well aware that he is of the same opinion and of the same spirit, and therefore is distressed that a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> akin to his own has been cast out of the church, as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it is entirely allied to his own in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p><strong>Leporius together with some others recants his Pelagianism.</strong></p>

<p>But still as those who were the outcome of this stock of pestilent thorns have already by the Divine help and goodness been healed, we should also now <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to our Lord God that as in some points that older <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and this new one are akin to each other, He would grant a like <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> ending to those which had a like bad beginning. For Leporius, then a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, now a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, who followed the teaching or rather the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> of Pelagius, as we said above, and was among the earliest and greatest champions of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, was admonished by us and corrected by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so nobly condemned his former erroneous persuasion that his amendment was almost as much a matter for congratulation as is the unimpaired <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of many. For it is the best thing never to fall into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>: the second best thing to make a good repudiation of it. He then coming to himself confessed his mistake with grief but without shame not only in Africa, where he was then and is now,  but also gave to all the cities of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> penitent letters containing his confession and grief; in order that his return to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> where his deviation from it had been first published, and that those who had formerly been witnesses of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> might also afterwards be witnesses of his amendment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p><strong>By the case of Leporius he establishes the fact that an open sin ought to be expiated by an open confession; and also teaches from his words what is the right view to be held on the Incarnation.</strong></p>

<p>And from his confession or rather lamentation we have thought it well to quote some part, for two reasons: that their recantation might be a testimony to us, and an example to those who are weak, and that they might not be ashamed to follow in their amendment, the men whom they were not ashamed to follow in their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; and that they might be cured by a like remedy as they suffered from a like disease. He then acknowledging the perverseness of his views, and seeing the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, wrote to the Gallican Bishops, and thus began:  <q>I scarcely <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O my most venerable lords and blessed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, what first to accuse myself of, and what first to excuse myself for. Clumsiness and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and foolish <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> together with wrong notions, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> combined with indiscretion, and (to speak <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>) a weak <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was gradually failing, all these were admitted by me and flourished to such an extent that I am ashamed of having yielded to such and so many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, while at the same time I am profoundly thankful for having been able to cast them out of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> And after a little he adds: <q>If then, not understanding this power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and wise in our conceits and opinions, from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest God should seem to act a part that was beneath Him, we suppose that a man was born in conjunction with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in such a way that we ascribe to God alone what belongs to God separately, and attribute to man alone what belongs to man separately, we clearly add a fourth Person to the Trinity and out of the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> the Son begin to make not one but two Christs; from which may our Lord and God <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Himself preserve us. Therefore we confess that our Lord and God <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who for His own sake  was begotten of the Father before all worlds, when in time He was for our sakes  made man of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and the ever-virgin Mary, was God at His birth; and while we confess the two substances of the flesh and the Word,  we always acknowledge with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> belief and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> one and the same Person to be indivisibly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; and we say that from the time when He took upon Him flesh all that belonged to God was given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as all that belonged to man was joined to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  And in this sense 'the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>:' <span class="stiki" id="note352377"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> not that He began by any conversion or change to be what He was not, but that by the Divine 'economy' the Word of the Father never left the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,  and yet vouchsafed to become <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> man, and the Only Begotten was incarnate through that hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which He alone understands (for it is ours to <em><a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a></em>: His to <em>understand</em>). And thus God 'the Word' Himself receiving everything that belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is made man, and the manhood  which is assumed, receiving everything that belongs to God cannot but be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but whereas He is said to be incarnate and unmixed, we must not hold that there is any diminution of His substance: for God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to communicate Himself without suffering any corruption, and yet <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to communicate Himself. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to receive into Himself without Himself being increased thereby, just as He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to impart Himself in such a way as Himself to suffer no loss. We should not then in our feeble minds make guesses, in accordance with visible <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> and experiments, from the case of creatures which are equal, and which mutually enter into each other, nor think that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are mixed together, and that out of such a fusion of flesh and the Word (i.e., the Godhead and manhood) some sort of body is produced. God forbid that we should <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> being in a way moulded together should become one substance. For a mixture of this sort is destructive of both parts. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who contains and is not Himself contained, who enters into things and is not Himself entered into, who fills things and is not Himself filled, who is everywhere at once in His completeness and is diffused everywhere, communicates Himself graciously to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by the infusion of His power.</q> And after a little: <q>Therefore the God-man, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born for us of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and the ever-virgin Mary. And so in the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> the Word and Flesh become one, so that while each substance continues naturally perfect in itself, what is Divine imparts without suffering any loss, to the humanity, and what is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> participates in the Divine; nor is there one person <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and another person man, but the same person is God who is also man: and again the man who is also God is called and indeed is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and so we must always take care and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> so as not to deny that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Very God (whom we confess as existing ever with the Father and equal to the Father before all worlds) became from the moment when He took flesh the God-man. Nor may we <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that gradually as time went on He became <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that He was in one condition before the resurrection and in another after it, but that He was always of the same fullness and power.</q> And again a little later on: But because the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>  vouchsafed to come down upon manhood by assuming manhood, and manhood was taken up into the Word by being assumed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> in His completeness became complete man. For it was not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father who was made man, nor the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but the Only Begotten of the Father; and so we must hold that there is one Person of the Flesh and the Word: so as faithfully and without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that one and the same <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who can never be divided, existing in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>  (who was also spoken of as a <q>giant</q> ) in the days of His Flesh <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> took upon Him all that belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and ever <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> had as His own what belongs to God: since even though  He was crucified in weakness, yet He lives by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.</h2>

<p><strong>The united doctrine of the Catholics is to be received as the orthodox faith.</strong></p>

<p>This confession of his therefore, which was the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was approved of by all the Bishops of Africa,  whence he wrote, and by all those of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, to whom he wrote. Nor has there ever been anyone who quarrelled with this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, without being guilty of unbelief: for to deny what is right and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> is to confess what is wrong. The agreement of all ought then to be in itself already sufficient to confute <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>: for the authority of all shows undoubted <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and a perfect reason results where no one disputes it: so that if a man endeavours to hold opinions contrary to these, we should in the first instance rather condemn his perverseness than listen to his assertions, for one who impugns the judgment of all announces beforehand his own condemnation, and a man who disturbs what has been determined by all, is not even given a hearing. For when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has once for all been established by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whatever arises contrary to it is by this very fact to be recognized at once as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, because it differs from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And thus it is agreed that this alone is sufficient to condemn a man; viz., that he differs from the judgment of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But still as an explanation of a system does no harm to the system, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> always shines brighter when thoroughly ventilated, and as it is better that those who are wrong should be set right by discussion rather than condemned by severe censures, we should cure, as far as we can with the Divine assistance, this old <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> appearing in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, that when through God's mercy they have recovered their health, their cure may bear testimony to our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> instead of their condemnation proving an instance of just severity. Only may the Truth indeed be present at our discussion and discourse concerning it, and assist our <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness with that goodness with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> vouchsafed to come to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as for this purpose above all He willed to be born on earth and among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; viz., that there might be no more room for <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>.</p>
