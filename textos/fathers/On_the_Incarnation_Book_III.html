<h1>On the Incarnation (Book III)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1.</h2>

<p><strong>That Christ, who is God and man in the unity of Person, sprang from Israel and the Virgin Mary according to the flesh.</strong></p>

<p>That divine teacher of the Churches when in writing to the Romans he was reproving or rather lamenting the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, i.e., of his own brethren, made use of these words: <q>I wished myself,</q> said he, <q>to be accursed from Christ, for my brethren, who are my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, to whom belongs the adoption as of children, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the testaments, and the giving of the law, and the service  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the promises: whose are the fathers, of whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352418"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;9:3-5</a></span> O, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of that most faithful Apostle, and most kindly kinsman! Who in his <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> charity wished to die&mdash; as a kinsman for his relations, and as a master for his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And what then was the reason why he wished to die? Only one; viz., that they might live. But in what did their life consist? Simply in this, as he himself says, that they might recognize a Divine Christ born according to the flesh, of their own flesh. And therefore the Apostle grieved the more, because those who ought to have loved Him the more as sprung from their own stock, failed to understand that He was born of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. <q>Of whom,</q> said he, <q>is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed for ever.</q> Clearly he lays down that from them according to the flesh, was born that Christ who is over all, God blessed for ever. You certainly cannot deny that Christ was born from them according to the flesh. But the same Person, who was born from them, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. How can you get round this? How can you shuffle out of it? The Apostle says that Christ who was born of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> according to the flesh, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Teach us, if you can, at what time He did not exist. <q>Of whom,</q> he says, <q>is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God.</q> You see that because the Apostle has united and joined together these, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></q> cannot possibly be separated from <q>Christ.</q> For just as the Apostle declares that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is of them, so he asserts that God is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. You must either deny both of these statements, or you must accept both. Christ is said to be born of them according to the flesh: but the same Person is declared by the Apostle to be <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> Whence also he says elsewhere: <q>For God was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, reconciling the world to Himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352419"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:19</a></span> It is absolutely impossible to separate one from the other. Either deny that Christ sprang from them, or admit that there was born of the virgin God in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>who is,</q> as he says, <q>over all, God blessed for ever.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p><strong>The title of God is given in one sense to Christ, and in another to men.</strong></p>

<p>The name of God would for the faithful be amply sufficient to denote the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His Divinity, but by adding <q>over all, God blessed,</q> he excludes a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> and perverse interpretation of it, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that some evil-disposed person to depreciate His absolute Divinity might quote the fact that the word God is sometimes applied by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the Divine economy temporarily to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and thus apply it to God by unworthy comparisons, as where God says to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>I have given you as a God to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352420"><a href="../bible/exo007.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;7:1</a></span> or in this passage: <q>I said you are Gods,</q>  where it clearly has the force of a title given by condescension. For as it says <q>I said,</q> it is not a name showing power, so much as a title given by the speaker. But that passage also, where it says: <q>I have given you as a God to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>,</q> shows the power of the giver rather than the Divinity of him who receives the title. For when it says: <q>I have given,</q> it thereby certainly indicates the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gave, and not the Divine nature, in the person of the recipient. But when it is said of our God and Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <q>who is over all, God blessed for ever,</q> the fact is at once <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the words, and the meaning of the words shown by the name given: because in the case of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> the name of God does not denote an adoption by favour, but what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and really His nature.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p><strong>He explains the apostle's saying: <q>If from henceforth we know no man according to the flesh,</q> etc.</strong></p>

<p>And so the same Apostle says: <q>From henceforth we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no man according to the flesh, and if we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ according to the flesh, yet now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him so no longer.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352422"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:16</a></span> Admirably consistent are all the writings of the sacred word with each other, and in every portion of them: even where they do not correspond in the <em>form</em> of the words, yet they agree in the drift and substance. As where he says: <q>And if we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ according to the flesh, yet now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him so no longer.</q> For the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the passage before us confirms that quoted above, in which he said: <q>Of whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever.</q> For there he writes: <q>Of whom is Christ according to the flesh;</q> and here: <q>if we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ according to the flesh.</q> There: <q>who is over all, God blessed for ever;</q> and here: <q>yet now we no longer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Christ according to the flesh.</q> The look of the words is different, but their force and drift is the same. For it is the same Person whom he there declares to be God over all born according to the flesh, whom he here asserts that he no longer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> according to the flesh. And plainly for this reason; viz., because Him whom he had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as born in the flesh, he acknowledges as God for ever; and therefore says that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> him not after the flesh, because He is over all, God blessed for ever; and the phrase there: <q>who is over all <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> answers to this: <q>we no longer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Christ according to the flesh;</q> and this phrase: <q>we no longer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Christ according to the flesh</q> implies this: <q>who is God blessed for ever.</q>  The declaration of Apostolic teaching then somehow rises, as it were to greater heights, and though it is self-consistent throughout, yet it supports the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the perfect <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, with a still more express statement, and says: <q>And though we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ according to the flesh, yet now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him so no longer,</q> i.e., as formerly we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him as man as well as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet now only as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For when the frailty of flesh comes to an end, we no longer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> anything in Him except the power of Divinity, for all that is in Him is the power of Divine Majesty, where the weakness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity has ceased to exist. In this passage then he has thoroughly expounded the whole <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Incarnation, and of His perfect Divinity. For where he says: <q>And if we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ according to the flesh,</q> he speaks of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of God born in flesh. But by adding <q>yet now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him so no longer,</q> he manifests His power when weakness is laid aside. And thus that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the flesh has to do with His humanity, and that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His Divinity. For to say <q>we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ according to the flesh:</q> means as long as that which was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. Now we no longer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, after it has ceased to exist. For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of flesh has been transformed into a spiritual substance: and that which formerly belonged to the manhood, has all become God's. And therefore we no longer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Christ according to the flesh, because when bodily infirmity has been absorbed by Divine Majesty,  nothing remains in that Sacred Body, from which weakness of the flesh can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in it. And thus whatever had formerly belonged to a twofold substance, has become attached to a single Power. Since there is no sort of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who was crucified through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness lives entirely through the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His Divinity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p><strong>From the Epistle to the Galatians he brings forward a passage to show that the weakness of the flesh in Christ was absorbed by His Divinity.</strong></p>

<p>The Apostle indeed declares this in the whole body of his writings, and admirably says in writing to the Galatians: <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> an Apostle not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, neither by man, but by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352425"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;1:1</a></span> You see how thoroughly consistent he is with himself in the former and the present passage. For there he says: <q>Now we no longer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Christ according to the flesh.</q> Here he says: <q>Not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, neither by man, but by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> It is clear that his doctrine is the same here as in the former passage. For where he says that he is not sent by man, he implies: <q>We have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ according to the flesh:</q> and so I am <q>not sent by man</q> but <q>by Christ;</q>  for if I am sent by Christ, I am not sent by man but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For there is no longer room for the name of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in Him whom Divinity claims entirely for itself. And so when he had said that he was sent <q>not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, neither by man, but by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>,</q> he rightly added: <q>And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> thus showing that he was sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and God the Son; in whom owing to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the sacred and ineffable generation there are two Persons (He who begets, and He who is begotten), but there is but one single Power of God who is the sender. And so in saying that he was sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, he shows that the Persons are two in number, but he also teaches that their Power is One in sending.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p><strong>As it is blasphemy to pare away the Divinity of Christ, so also is it blasphemous to deny that He is true man.</strong></p>

<p>But he says <q>by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who raised Him from the dead.</q> That renowned and admirable teacher, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> must be preached as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man, as well as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, always declares the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Divine in Him, in such a way as not to lose hold of the confession of the Incarnation: plainly excluding the phantasm of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, by a real Incarnation, and the poverty of the Ebionite, by Divinity: lest through one or other of these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> it might be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> was either altogether man without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or God without man. Excellently then did the Apostle, when declaring that He was sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Son as well as by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, add at once a confession of the Lord's Incarnation, by saying: <q>Who raised Him from the dead:</q> clearly teaching that it was a real body of the Incarnate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which was raised from the dead: in accordance with this: <q>And though we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ according to the flesh,</q> excellently adding: <q>Yet now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him so no longer.</q> For he says that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> this in Him according to the flesh; viz., that He was raised from the dead; but that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him no longer according to the flesh inasmuch as when the weakness of the flesh is at an end, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that He exists in the Power of God only. Surely he is a faithful and satisfactory <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of our Lord's Divinity which had to be proclaimed, who at his first call was smitten from heaven itself, and did not merely <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in his heart the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who was raised from the dead, but actually established its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by the evidence of his bodily eyes.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.</h2>

<p><strong>He shows from the appearance of Christ vouchsafed to the Apostle when persecuting the Church, the existence of both natures in Him.</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Wherefore</span> also, when arguing before King Agrippa and others of the world's judges, he speaks as follows: <q>When I was going to Damascus with authority and permission of the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, at midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and all those that were with me. And when we were all fallen down to the ground, I heard a voice saying unto me in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goad. And I said, Who are You, Lord? And the Lord said to me: I am <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, whom you persecute.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352427"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse12">Acts&nbsp;26:12-15</a></span> You see how <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the Apostle said that he no longer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> according to the flesh one whom he had seen in such splendour and majesty. For when as he lay prostrate he saw the splendour of that divine light which he was unable to endure, there followed this voice: <q>Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?</q> And when he asked who it might be, the Lord answers and clearly points out His Personality: <q>I am <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, whom you persecute.</q> Now then, you <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, I ask you, I summon you. Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what the Apostle says of himself, or do you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it? Or if you think that unimportant, do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what the Lord says of Himself or do you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it? If you do <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it, there is an end of the matter: for you cannot help believing what we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For we, like the Apostle, even if we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ according to the flesh, yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him so no longer. <em>We</em> do not heap insults on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <em>We</em> do not separate the flesh from the Divinity; and all that is in Christ <em>we</em> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If then you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the same that we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you must acknowledge the same <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But if you differ from us, if you refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, the Apostle, aye and God's own testimony about Himself, show us in this vision which the Apostle saw, how much is flesh, and how much God. For I cannot here separate one from the other. I see the ineffable light, I see the inexpressible splendour, I see the radiance that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness cannot endure, and beyond what mortal eyes can bear, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God shining with inconceivable light.  What room is there here for division and separation? In the voice we hear Jesus, in the majesty we see God. How can we help believing that in one and the same (Personal) substance God and Jesus exist. But I should like to have a few more words with you on this subject. Tell me, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, if there appeared to you in your present <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that same vision which then appeared to the Apostle in his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, if when you were not expecting it and were off your guard, that radiance shone round about you, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of that boundless light smote you in your terror and confusion, and you lay prostrate in darkness of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; which the unlimited and indescribable terror of your heart increased, &mdash; tell me, I intreat you; When the dread of immediate death was pressing on you, and the terror of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that threatened you from above, weighed you down, and you heard as well in your bewilderment of mind those words which your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> so well deserves: <q>Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?</q> and to your inquiry who it was the answer was given from heaven: <q>I am <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, whom you persecute,</q> what would you say? <q>I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, I do not yet fully <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. I want to think over it with myself a little longer, who I think that You are, who speakest from heaven, who overwhelmest me with the brightness of Your Divinity: whose voice I hear and whose splendour I cannot bear. I must consider of this matter, whether I ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> You or not: whether You are Christ or God. If You are God alone whether it is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. If You are Christ alone, whether it is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I want this distinction to be carefully observed, and thoroughly considered what we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that You are, and what we should judge You to be. For I don't want any of my offices to be wasted. As if I were to regard You as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and yet pay to You some Divine honours.</q> If then you were lying on the ground, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> was then lying, and overwhelmed with the brightness of the Divine light, were at your last gasp, perhaps you would say this, and prate with all this silly chattering. But what shall we make of the fact that another course commended itself to the Apostle; and when he had fallen down, trembling and half dead, he did not think that he ought any longer to conceal his belief, or to deliberate; it was enough for him that he was taught by inexpressible arguments to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He whom he had <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a> fancied to be a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, was God. He did not conceal his belief, he made no delay. He did not any longer protract his erroneous ideas by deliberating and disbelieving, but as soon as he heard from heaven the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> his Lord, he replied in a voice, subdued like that of a servant, tremulous like that of one scourged, and full of fervour like that of one converted, <q>What shall I do, Lord?</q> And so at once for his ready and earnest <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it was granted to him that he should never be without His presence whom he had faithfully <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: and that He, to whom he had passed in heart, should Himself pass into his heart: as the Apostle himself says of himself: <q>Do you seek a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of Christ that speaks in me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352430"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:3</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 7.</h2>

<p><strong>He shows once more by other passages of the Apostle that Christ is God.</strong></p>

<p>I want you to tell me, you <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, whether in this passage He who, as the Apostle tells us, speaks in him, is man or God. If He is man, how can another's body speak in his heart? If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then Christ is not a man but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for since Christ spoke in the Apostle, and only God could speak in him, therefore a Divine Christ spoke in him. And so you see that there is nothing to be said here, that no division or separation can be made between Christ and God: because complete Divinity was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and Christ was completely in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. No division or severing of the two can here be admitted. There is only one simple, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and sound confession to be made; viz., to adore, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and worship Christ as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But do you want to understand more fully and thoroughly that there is no separation to be made between God and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and that we must hold that God is altogether one with Christ? Hear what the Apostle says to the Corinthians: <q>For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he has done, whether it be good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352431"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:10</a></span> But in another passage, in writing to the Romans he says: <q>We shall all stand before the judgment seat of God: for it is written: As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352432"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;14:10-11</a></span> You see then that the judgment seat of God is the same as that of Christ; understand then without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and when you see that the substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Christ is altogether inseparable, admit also that the Person cannot be severed. Unless forsooth because the Apostle in one Epistle said that we should be manifested before the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and in another before that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you invent two judgment seats, and fancy that some will be judged by Christ and others by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But this is foolish and wild, and madder than a madman's utterances. Acknowledge then the Lord of all, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, acknowledge the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Love life, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him by whom you were created. Fear Him by whom you are to be judged. For whether you will or no, you have to be manifested before the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and laying aside <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and the childish talk of unbelieving words, though you think that the judgment seat of God is different from that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, you will come before the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and will find by evidence that there is no gainsaying, that the judgment seat of God is indeed the same as that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and that in Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, there is all the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the power of God the Father. <q>For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Son as they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352433"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;5:22-23</a></span> For whoever denies the Father denies the Son also. <q>Whosoever denies the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the same has not the Father: he that confesses the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, has the Father also.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352434"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:23</a></span> And so you should learn that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is inseparable, and their majesty is inseparable also and that the Son cannot be honoured without the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor the Father without the Son. But no man can <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> God and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> except in Christ the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For it is impossible for a man to have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> who is to be honoured except in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the Apostle says: <q>But you are not in the flesh, but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, if so be that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwell in you. But if any man have not the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he is none of His.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352435"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;8:9</a></span> And again: <q>Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies. Who is he that condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died, yea rather who rose again.</q>  You see then now, even against your will, that there is absolutely no difference between the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> and the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or between the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the judgment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Choose then which you will&mdash; for one of the two must happen&mdash; either acknowledge in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or admit that God is in Christ at your condemnation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.</h2>

<p><strong>When confessing the Divinity of Christ we ought not to pass over in silence the confession of the cross.</strong></p>

<p>But let us see what else follows. In writing to the church of Corinth, he whom we spoke of above, the instructor of all the churches viz. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, speaks thus: <q>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,</q> says he, <q>seek signs, and the Greeks ask for wisdom. But we preach Christ crucified, to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a stumbling-block, to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> foolishness: but to them that are saved, both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks, Christ the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352437"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:22-24</a></span> O most powerful teacher of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who even in this passage, when teaching the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> thought it not enough to speak of Christ as God without adding that He was crucified on purpose that for the sake of the open and solid teaching of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he might proclaim Him, whom he called the crucified, to be the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He then employed no subtlety or circumlocution, nor did he when he preached the gospel of the Lord blush at the mention of the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And though it was a stumbling-block to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and foolishness to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to hear of God as born, God in bodily form, God suffering, God crucified, yet he did not weaken the force of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> utterance because of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the offense of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: nor did he lessen the vigour of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> because of the unbelief and the foolishness of others: but openly, persistently, and boldly proclaimed that He, whom a mother  had borne, whom men had slain, the spear had pierced, the cross had stretched&mdash; was <q>the power and wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a stumbling-block, and to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> foolishness.</q> But still that which was to some a stumbling-block and foolishness, was to others the power and wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For as the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> differed, so was there a difference of their thoughts: and what a man who was void of sound understanding, and incapable of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> good, foolishly denied in unbelief, that a wise <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> could feel in its inmost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and life giving.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.</h2>

<p><strong>How the Apostle's preaching was rejected by Jews and Gentiles because it confessed that the crucified Christ was God.</strong></p>

<p>Tell me then, you <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, you enemy of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but of yourself above all&mdash; to whom the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is an offense as with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and foolishness as with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, you who reject the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, with the stumbling of the former, and are foolish with the stubbornness of the others, why was the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> foolishness to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, and a stumbling-block to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? Surely it would never have offended men, if he had taught that Christ was, as you maintain He is, a mere man? For who would think that His birth, passion, cross, and death were incredible or a difficulty? Or what would there have been novel or strange about the preaching of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, if he had said that a merely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> Christ suffered that which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> daily endures among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> everywhere? But it was surely this that the foolishness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> could not receive, and the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> rejected; viz., that the Apostle declared that Christ whom they, like you, fancied to be a mere man, was God. This it certainly was which the thoughts of these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men rejected, which the ears of the faithless could not endure; viz., that the birth of God should be proclaimed in the man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, that the passion of God should be asserted, and the cross of God proclaimed. This it was which was a difficulty: this was what was incredible; for that was incredible to the hearing of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which had never been heard of as happening to the Divine nature. And so you are quite secure, with such an announcement and teaching as yours, that your preaching will never be either foolishness to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> or a stumbling-block to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. You will never be crucified with Peter by <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> with James, nor beheaded with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. For there is nothing in your preaching to offend them. You maintain that a mere man was born, a mere man suffered. You need not be afraid of their troubling you with <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, for you are helping them by your preaching.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p><strong>How the apostle maintains that Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</strong></p>

<p>But let us see something more on the subject. Christ then, according to the Apostle, is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What have you to say to this? How can you get out of it? There is no place for you to escape and fly to. Christ is the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He, I say, whom the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> attacked, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> mocked, whom you yourself together with them are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a>&mdash;He, I say, who is foolishness to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and a stumbling-block to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and both to you, He, I say, is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What is there that you can do? Shut your ears, forsooth, so as not to hear? This the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> did also when the Apostle was preaching. Do what you will, Christ is in heaven, and in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with Him, and in Him in the heavens above in whom also He was here below: you can no longer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> Him with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. But you do the one thing that you can. You <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> Him in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, you <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> Him in the church, you <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> Him with the arms of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> belief, you <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> Him with the sword of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a>. Perhaps you do rather more than the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of old did. You now <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> Christ, after ever those who did <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> Him, have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. But perhaps you think that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is less because you can no longer lay hands on Him. No less grievous, I tell you, no less grievous to Him is that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, in which sinful men <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> Him in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of His followers. But the mention of the Lord's cross offends you. It always offended the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as well. You shudder at hearing that God suffered: the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> mocked at this also. I ask you then, in what point do you differ from them, since you both agree in this frowardness? But for my part I not only do not water down this preaching of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> cross, this preaching of the Lord's passion, but as far as my wishes and powers go I emphasise it. For I will declare that He who was crucified is not only the power and wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, than which there is nothing greater, but actually Lord of absolute Divinity and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And this the rather, because this assertion of mine is the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the Apostle says: <q>We speak wisdom among them that are perfect: but the wisdom not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world who are brought to nought: but we speak the hidden wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ordained before the world, unto our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: which none of the princes of this world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>: for if they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, they would never have crucified the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But as it is written: that eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has it entered into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, what God has prepared for them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352439"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:6-9</a></span> You see what great matters the Apostle's discourse comprises in how small a compass. He says that he speaks wisdom, but a wisdom which only those that are perfect can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and which the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> of this world cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. For he says that this is the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is hidden in a Divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> before all worlds for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: and that therefore it is only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to those who savour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; while the princes of this world are utterly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it. But he adds the reason, to establish both points that he had mentioned, saying: <q>For if they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, they would never have crucified the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But it is written, that eye has not seen, nor ear has heard, neither has it entered into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, what God has prepared for them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him.</q> You see then how the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hidden in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> before all worlds, was unknown to those who crucified the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by those who received it. And well does he say that the wisdom of God was hidden in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, for never yet could the eye of any man see, or the ear hear, or the heart <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> this; viz., that the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> should be born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and come in the flesh, and suffer all kinds of punishment, and shameful passion. But with regard to these gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as there is no one who&mdash; since they were hidden in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>&mdash; could ever of himself understand them, so blessed is he who has grasped them when they are revealed. Thus all who have failed to grasp them must be reckoned among the princes of this world, and those who have grasped them among God's wise ones. He then does not grasp it who denies God born in the flesh; therefore you also do not grasp it, as you deny this. But do what you will, deny as impiously as you like, we the rather <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the Apostle. But why should I say the Apostle? The rather do we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> God. For through the Apostle we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him, whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have spoken by the Apostle. The Divine word says that the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was crucified by the princes of the world. You deny it. They also who crucified Him denied that it was God whom they were crucifying. They then who confess Him have their portion with the Apostle who confessed Him. You are sure to have your lot with His persecutors. What is there then that can be replied to this? The Apostle says that the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was crucified. Alter this if you can. Separate now, if you please, Jesus from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. At least you cannot deny that Christ was crucified by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. But it was the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> who was crucified. Therefore you must either deny that Christ was nailed to the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, or you must admit that God was nailed to it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p><strong>He supports the same doctrine by proofs from the gospel.</strong></p>

<p>But perhaps it is a difficulty to you that all this time I am chiefly using the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> alone. He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> enough for me, whom God chose, nor do I blush to call as the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the man whom God willed to be the teacher of the whole world. But to yield to your wishes, as perhaps you fancy that I have no other <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> to use, hear the perfect <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> bliss, which Martha proclaims in the gospel.

Learn the confession of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> hope. Yet you have a splendid consolation: you need not blush to be taught the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by her, whose testimony God did not refuse to accept.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p><strong>He proves from the renowned confession of the blessed Peter that Christ is God.</strong></p>

<p>But if you prefer the authority of a greater person (although you ought not to slight the authority of any one of either sex, on whom the confession of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> confers weight&mdash; for whatever may be a person's condition, or however <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> his position, yet the value of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not thereby diminished) let us interrogate no beginner or untaught schoolboy, nor a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might perhaps appear to be but rudimentary; but that greatest of <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> among <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and of teachers among teachers, who presided and ruled over the Roman Church, and held the chief place  in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> as he did in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Tell us then, tell us, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, O Peter, you chief of Apostles, tell us how the Churches ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is right that you should teach us, as you were taught by the Lord, and that you should open to us the gate, of which you received the key. Shut out all those who try to overthrow the heavenly house: and those who are endeavouring to enter by secret holes and unlawful approaches: as it is clear that none can enter the gate of the kingdom save one to whom the key bestowed on the Churches is revealed by you. Tell us then how we ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and to confess our common Lord. You will surely reply without hesitation: <q>Why do you consult me as to the way in which the Lord should be confessed, when you have before you my own confession of Him? Read the gospel, and you will not want me myself, when you have got my confession. Nay, you have got me myself when you have my confession; for though I have no weight apart from my confession, yet the actual confession adds weight to my person.</q> Tell us then, O Evangelist, tell us the confession: tell us the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the chief Apostle: did he confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was only a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or God? Did he say that there was nothing but flesh in Him, or did he proclaim Him the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? When then the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> asked whom the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and confessed Him to be, Peter, the first of the Apostles, replied&mdash; one in the name of all&mdash; for the answer of one was to the same effect as the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of them all. But it was fitting that he should first give the answer, that the order of the answer might correspond to the degree of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>: and that he might outstrip them in confession, as he outstripped them in age. What then does he say? <q>You are,</q> he says, <q>the Christ the Son of the living God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352442"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;16:16</a></span> I am <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, you <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, to make use of a plain and simple question to confute you. Tell me, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, who was He, to whom Peter gave that answer? You cannot deny that it was the Christ. I ask then, what do you call Christ? Man or God? Man certainly without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>: for hence springs the whole of your <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, because you deny that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And so too you say that Mary is Christotocos, but not Theotocos, because she was the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore you maintain, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is only a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so that He is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What then does Peter reply to this? <q>You are,</q> he says, <q>the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living God.</q> That Christ whom you declare to be only the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, he testifies to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Whom would you like us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? You or Peter? I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that you are not so shameless as to venture to prefer your own opinion to that of the first of the Apostles. And yet what is there that you would not venture on? Or how can you help scorning the Apostle, if you can deny God? <q>You are then,</q> he says, <q>the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living God.</q> Is there anything puzzling or obscure in this? It is nothing but a plain and open confession: he proclaims Christ to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Perhaps you will deny that the words were spoken: but the Evangelist testifies that they were. Or do you say that the Apostle told a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>? But it is an awful lie to accuse an Apostle of lying. Or perhaps you will maintain that the words were spoken of some other Christ? But this is a novel kind of monstrous fabrication. What then is left for you? One thing indeed; viz., that since what is written is read, and what is read is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, you should finally be driven by force and compulsion (as you cannot assert its <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>) to desist from impugning its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.</h2>

<p><strong>The confession of the blessed Peter receives a testimony to its truth from Christ Himself.</strong></p>

<p>But still, as I have made use of the testimony of the chief Apostle, in which he openly confessed the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let us see how He whom he confessed approved of his confession; for of far more value than the Apostle's words is the fact that God Himself commended his utterance. When then the Apostle said: <q>You are the Christ the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> what was the answer of our Lord and Saviour? <q>Blessed are you,</q> said He, <q>Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you but the Spirit of My Father which is in heaven.</q> If you do not like to use the testimony of the Apostle use that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For by commending what was said God added His own authority to the Apostle's utterance, so that although the utterance came from the lips of the Apostle, yet God who approved of it made it His own. <q>Blessed are you,</q> said He, <q>Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you, but the Spirit of My Father which is in heaven.</q> Thus in the words of the Apostle you have the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and of the Son who was present and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. What more can you want, or what comes up to this? The Son commended: the Father was present: the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> revealed. The utterance of the Apostle thus gives the testimony of the entire Godhead: for this utterance must necessarily have the authority of Him from whose prompting it proceeds. <q>Blessed then are you,</q> said He, <q>Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you, but the Spirit of My Father which is in heaven.</q> If then flesh and blood did not reveal this to Peter or inspire him, you must at last see who inspires you. If the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> taught him who confessed that Christ was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you see how you are taught by the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> if you can deny it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.</h2>

<p><strong>How the confession of the blessed Peter is the faith of the whole Church.</strong></p>

<p>But what are the other words which follow that saying of the Lord's, with which He commends Peter? <q>And I,</q> said He, <q>say unto you, that you are Peter and upon this rock I will build My Church.</q> Do you see how the saying of Peter is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? He then must of course be outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who does not hold the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <q>And to you,</q> says the Lord, <q>I will give the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> This <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> deserved heaven: this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> received the keys of the heavenly kingdom. See what awaits you. You cannot enter the gate to which this key belongs, if you have denied the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of this key. <q>And the gate,</q> He adds, <q>of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail against you.</q> The gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> are the belief or rather the misbelief of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For widely as <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is separated from heaven, so widely is he who denies from him who confessed that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>Whatsoever,</q> He proceeds, <q>you shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you shall loose on earth, shall be loosed also in heaven.</q> The perfect <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Apostle somehow is given the power of Deity, that what it should bind or loose on earth, might be bound or loosed in heaven. For you then, who come against the Apostle's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as you see that already you are bound on earth, it only remains that you should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are bound also in heaven. But it would take too long to go into details which are so numerous as to make a long and wearisome story, even if they are related with brevity and conciseness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.</h2>

<p><strong>St. Thomas also confessed the same faith as Peter after the Lord's resurrection.</strong></p>

<p>But I want still to add one more testimony from an Apostle for you: that you may see how what followed after the passion corresponded with what went before it. When then the Lord appeared in the midst of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> when the doors were shut, and wished to make clear to the Apostles the reality of His body, when the Apostle Thomas felt His flesh and handled His side and examined His wounds&mdash; what was it that he declared, when he was convinced of the reality of the body shown to him? <q>My Lord,</q> he said, <q>and my God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352443"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;20:28</a></span> Did he say what you say, that it was a man and not God? Christ and not Divinity? He surely touched the body of his Lord and answered that He was God. Did he make any separation between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? Or did he call that flesh Theotocos, to use your expression, i.e., that which received Divinity? Or did he, after the fashion of your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, declare that He whom he touched was to be honoured not for His own sake, but for the sake of Him whom He had received into Himself? But perhaps God's Apostle <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing of that subtle separation of yours, and had no experience of the fine distinctions of your judgment, as he was a rude countryman, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the dialectic art, and of the method of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> disputation; for whom the Lord's teaching was amply sufficient, and as he was one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing whatever except what he learned from the instruction of the Lord! And so his words contain heavenly doctrine; his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a Divine lesson. He had never learned to separate, as you do, the Lord from His body: and had no idea how to rend God asunder from Himself. He was <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, straightforward, upright: filled with practical innocence, unalloyed <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and pure <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: having a simple understanding joined with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, a wisdom entirely free from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, together with perfect simplicity: <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of any corruption, and free from all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> perversity, and as one who had experienced in himself the force of the Divine lesson, he held fast everything which he had learned. And so he&mdash; countryman and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> fellow as you fancy him&mdash; shuts you up with a brief answer, and destroys your position with a few words of his. What then did the Apostle Thomas touch when he drew near to handle his God? Certainly it was Christ without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. But what did he exclaim? <q>My Lord,</q> he said, <q>and my God.</q> Now, if you can, separate Christ from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and change this saying, if you are able to. Make use of all dialectic art&mdash; all the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of this world, and that foolish wisdom which consists in wordy subtlety. Turn yourself about in every direction, and draw in your horns. Do whatever you can with ingenuity and art. Say what you like, and do what you like; you cannot possibly get out of this without confessing that what the Apostle touched was God. And indeed, if the thing can possibly be done, perhaps you will want to alter the statement of the gospel story, so that we may not read that the Apostle Thomas touched the body of the Lord, or that he called Christ Lord and God. But it is absolutely impossible to alter what is written in the gospel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <q>heaven and earth shall pass away, but the words</q> of God <q>shall not pass away.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352444"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse35">Matthew&nbsp;24:35</a></span> For lo, even now he who then bore his <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, the Apostle Thomas, proclaims to you: <q>Jesus whom I touched is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is God whose limbs I handled. I did not feel what was incorporeal, not handle what was intangible: I touched not a Spirit with my hand, so that it might be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that I said of it alone 'It is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.' For 'a spirit,' as my Lord Himself said, 'has not flesh and bones.' <span class="stiki" id="note352445"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;24:39</a></span> I touched the body of my Lord. I handled flesh and bones. I put my fingers into the prints of the wounds: and I declared of Christ my Lord, whom I had handled: 'My Lord and my God.' For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to make a separation between Christ and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and I cannot insert <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> distinctions between Jesus and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or rend my Lord asunder from Himself. Away from me, whoever is of a different opinion, and whoever says anything different. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not that Christ is other than God. This <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> I held together with my fellow <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: this I delivered to the Churches: this I preached to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: this I proclaim to you also, Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A sound mind imagines nothing else: a sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> says nothing else. The Deity cannot be parted from Itself. And since whatever is Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there can be found in God none other but God.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 16.</h2>

<p><strong>He brings forward the witness of God the Father to the Divinity of the Son.</strong></p>

<p>What do you say now, you <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>? Are these evidences of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, aye and of all your unbelief, enough for you: or would you like some more to be added to them? But what can be added after Prophets and Apostles? Unless perhaps&mdash; as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> once demanded&mdash; you too might ask for a sign to be given you from heaven? But if you ask this, we must give you the same answer which was formerly given to them: <q>An <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and adulterous generation seeks after a sign. And no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jonah.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352446"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;16:4</a></span> And indeed this sign would be enough for you as for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who crucified Him, that you might be taught to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Lord God by this alone, through which even those who had <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Him, came to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. But as we have mentioned a sign from heaven, I will show you a sign from heaven: and one of such a character that even the devils have never gainsaid it: while, constrained by the demands of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, though they saw Jesus in bodily form, they yet cried out that He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as indeed He was. What then does the Evangelist say of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>? <q>When He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>,</q> he says, <q>straightway He went up out of the water. And lo, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit descending like a dove, and coming upon Him. And behold, a voice from heaven, saying: This is My beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352447"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;3:16-17</a></span> What do you say to this, you <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>? Do you dislike the words spoken, or the Person of the Speaker? The meaning of the utterance at any rate needs no explanation: nor does the worth of the Speaker need the commendation of words. It is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father who spoke. What He said is clear enough. Surely you cannot make so shameless and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> an assertion as to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is not to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> concerning the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? <q>This,</q> He then says, <q>is My beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.</q> But perhaps you will try to maintain that this is <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, and that this was said of the Word and not of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Tell me then who was it who was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? The Word or Christ? Flesh or Spirit? You cannot possibly deny that it was Christ. That man then, born of man and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, conceived by the descent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> upon the Virgin, and by the overshadowing of the Power of the Most High, and thus the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He it was, as you cannot deny, who was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. If then it was He who was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, it was He also who was named, for certainly the Person who was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> was the one named. <q>This,</q> said He, <q>is My beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased.</q> Could anything be said with greater significance or clearness? Christ was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Christ went up out of the water. When Christ was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the heavens were opened. For Christ's sake the dove descended upon Christ, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was present in a bodily form. The Father addressed Christ. If you venture to deny that this was spoken of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the only thing is for you to maintain that Christ was not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that the Spirit did not descend, and that the Father did not speak. But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself is urgent and weighs you down so that even if you will not confess it, yet you cannot deny it. For what says the Evangelist? <q>When He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, straightway He went up out of the water.</q> Who was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? Most certainly Christ. <q>And behold,</q> he says, <q>the heavens were opened to Him.</q> To where, forsooth, save to Him who was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? Most certainly to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <q>And He saw the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> descending like a dove and coming upon Him.</q> Who saw? Christ indeed. Upon whom did It descend? Most certainly upon Christ. <q>And a voice came from heaven. saying</q>&mdash; of whom? Of Christ indeed: for what follows? <q>This is My beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased.</q> In order that it might be made clear on whose account all this happened, there followed the voice, saying: <q>This is My beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,</q> as if to say: This is He on whose account all this took place. For this is My Son: on His account the heavens were opened: on His account My Spirit came: on His account My voice was heard. For this is My Son. In saying then <q>This is My Son</q> whom did He so designate? Certainly Him whom the dove touched. And whom did the dove touch? Christ indeed. Therefore Christ is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. My promise is fulfilled, I fancy. Do you see then now, O <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, a sign given you from heaven; and not one only, but many and special ones? For there is one in the opening of heaven, another in the descent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, a third in the voice of the Father. All of which most clearly show that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the laying open of the heavens indicates that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the descent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> upon Him supports His Divinity, and the address of the Father confirms it. For heaven would not have been opened except in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of its Lord: nor would the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> have descended in a bodily form except upon the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>: nor would the Father have declared Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, had he not been <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> such; especially with such tokens of a Divine birth, as not merely to confirm the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, but also to exclude the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of guilty and erroneous belief. For when the Father had expressly and pointedly said with the inexpressible majesty of a Divine utterance, <q>This is My Son,</q> He added also what follows&mdash; I mean, <q>My beloved, in whom I am well pleased.</q> As He had already declared Him by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> to be God the Mighty and God the Great, so when He says here, <q>My beloved Son in whom I am well pleased,</q> He adds further to the name of His own Son the title also of His beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom He is well pleased: that the addition of the titles might denote the special properties of the Divine nature; and that that might specially redound to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, which had never happened to any man. And so just as in the case of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> these special and unique things happened; viz., that the heavens were opened, that in the sight of all <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father touched Him in a sort of way, through the coming and presence of the dove, and pointed almost with His finger to Him saying, <q>This is My Son;</q> so this too is special and unique in His case; viz., that He is specially beloved, and is specially named as well-pleasing to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in order that these special accompaniments might mark the special import of His nature, and that the special character of His names might support the special position of the only begotten Son, which the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the signs previously given had already confirmed. But here comes the end of this book. For this saying of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father can neither be added to, nor equalled by any words of men. For us <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Himself is a sufficiently satisfactory <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, when He says <q>This is My Son.</q> If you think that it is possible for these utterances of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father to be gainsaid, then you are forced to contradict Him, who by the clearest possible announcement caused Him to be acknowledged as His Son by the whole world.</p>
