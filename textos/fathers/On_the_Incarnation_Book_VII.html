<h1>On the Incarnation (Book VII)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1.</h2>

<p><strong>As he is going to reply to the slanders of his opponents he implores the aid of Divine grace to teach a prayer to be used by those who undertake to dispute with heretics.</strong></p>

<p>As it happens to those who having escaped the perils of the sea, are in terror of the sands that stretch before the harbour, or the rocks that line the shore, so it is in my case that&mdash;as I have kept to the last some of the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>&mdash;although I have reached the limit of the work which I set myself, yet I am beginning to dread the close, which I had longed to reach. But, as the Prophet says, <q>The Lord is my helper; I will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> what man can do to me,</q>  so we will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the pitfalls which crafty <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have dug in front of us, nor the paths thickly strewn with horrid thorns. For as they make our road difficult but do not close it, there is before us the trouble of clearing them away, rather than the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of not being able to do so. For when, as we are walking feebly along the right road, they come in our way, and frighten the walkers rather than hurt them, our work and business has more to do in clearing them away, than to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> from the difficulty of this: And so, laying our hands upon that monstrous head of the deadly serpent, and longing to lay hold of all the limbs that are entangled in the huge folds and coils of his body, again and again do we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to You, O Lord Jesus, to whom we have ever <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, that You would give us words by opening our mouth <q>to the pulling down of strongholds, destroying counsels, and every height that exalts itself against the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and bringing into captivity every understanding unto Your <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352595"><a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:4-5</a></span> for he is indeed free, who has begun to be led captive by You. Do Thou then be present to this work of yours, and to those of Yours who are striving for You above the measure of their strength. Grant us to bruise the gaping mouths of this new serpent, and its neck that swells with deadly poison, O You who makes the feet of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> to tread unharmed on serpents and scorpions, and to go upon the adder and basilisk, to tread under foot the lion and the dragon.  And grant that through the fearless boldness of steadfast innocence, the sucking child may play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child thrust his hand into the den of the basilisk. <span class="stiki" id="note352597"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;11:8</a></span> Grant then to us also that we may thrust our hands unharmed into the den of this monstrous and most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> basilisk; and if it has in any holes, i.e., in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart, a lurking or resting place, or has laid its eggs there, or left a trace of its slimy course, do Thou remove from them all the foul and deadly pollution of this most noxious serpent. Take away the uncleanness their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> has brought on them, and purify with the fan of Your sacred cleansing <span class="stiki" id="note352598"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse2">Malachi&nbsp;3:2-3</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are plunged in stinking mud, so that the <q>dens of thieves</q> may become <q>houses of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352599"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;21:13</a></span> and that in those which are now, as is written, the dwellings where hedgehogs and monsters,  and satyrs, and all kinds of strange creatures dwell, there the gifts of Your <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, namely the beauty of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> may shine forth. And as once You destroyed <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and cast out images, and make shrines of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> out of the temples of devils, and let into the dens of serpents and scorpions the rays of shining light, and make out of the dens of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and shame the homes of beauty and splendour, so do Thou pour upon all whose eyes the darkness of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> obstinacy has blinded, the light of Your compassion and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that they may at length with clear and unveiled sight behold the great and life-giving <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Your Incarnation, and so come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You to have been born as Very man of that sacred womb of a pure Virgin, and yet to acknowledge that You were always Very God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p><strong>He meets the objection taken from these words: No one gave birth to one who had existed before her.</strong></p>

<p>And before I begin to speak of those things of which I have given no foretaste in the earlier books, I think it right to try to carry out what I have already promised, that when I have thoroughly redeemed my pledge, I may begin to speak more freely of what has not been touched upon, after having satisfied my promise. So then that new serpent, in order to destroy the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nativity, hisses out against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> and says: <q>No one ever gives birth to one older than herself.</q> To begin with then I think that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> neither what you say nor where you get it from. For if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> or understood where you got it from, you would never regard the nativity of the only begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the light of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fancies, nor would you try to settle by merely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> propositions, about Him who was born without His conception originating from man: nor would you bring <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> impossibilities as objections against Divine Omnipotence if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that with God nothing was impossible. No one then, you say, gives birth to one older than herself. Tell me then, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, of what cases are you speaking, for the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of what creatures do you think that you can lay down rules? Do you suppose that you can fix <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for men or beasts or birds or cattle? Those (and others of the same kind) are the things of which such assertions can be made. For none of them is able to produce one older than itself; for what has already been produced cannot return to it again so as to be born again by a new creation. And so no one can bear one older than herself, as no one can beget one older than himself: for the opportunity of bearing only results where there is the possibility of begetting. Do you then <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that in reference to the nativity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> regard must be had to the same considerations as in the birth of earthly creatures? And do you bring the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> conditions as a difficulty in the case of Him who is Himself the author of nature? You see then that, as I said above, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whence or of whom you are talking, as you are comparing creatures to the Creator; and in order to calculate the power of God are drawing an instance from those things which would never have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> at all, but that the very fact of their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. God then came as He would, when He would, and of her whom He would. Neither time nor person, nor the manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, nor the custom of creatures was any difficulty with Him; for the law of the creatures could not stand in the way of Him who is Himself the Creator of them all. And whatever He would have possible was ready to His hand, for the power of willing it was His. Do you want to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how far the omnipotence of God extends, and how great it is? I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Lord could do that even in the case of His creatures which you do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He could do in His own case. For all living creatures which now bear things younger than themselves could, if only God gave the word, bear things much older than themselves. For even food and drink, if it were <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, could be turned into the f&oelig;tus and offspring: and even water, which has been flowing from the beginning of things, and which all living creatures use, could, if God gave the word, be made a body in the womb, and have birth given to it. For who can set a limit to divine works, or circumscribe <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>? Or who (to use the words of Scripture) can say to Him <q>What are you doing?</q>  If you deny that God can do all things, then deny, that, when God was born, one older than Mary could be born of her. But if there is nothing impossible with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why do you bring as an objection against His coming an impossibility, when you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that for Him nothing is impossible in anything?</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p><strong>He replies to the cavil that the one who is born must be of one substance with the one who bears.</strong></p>

<p>The second <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> or <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of your <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is when you say that the one who is born must be of one substance with the one who bears. It is not very different from the previous one, for it differs from it in terms rather than in fact and reality. For when we are treating of the birth of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you maintain that one of greater power could not be born of Mary just as above you maintain than one older could not be begotten. And so you may take it that the same answer may be given to this as to what you said before: or you may conceive that the answer given to this assertion, which you are now making, applies to that also. You say then that the one who is born must be of one substance with the one who bears. If this refers to earthly creatures, it is most certainly the case. But if it refers to the birth of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why in the case of His birth do you regard precedents from nature? For appointments are subject to Him who appointed them, and not the appointer to His appointments. But would you like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> more fully how these <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> of yours are not only <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> but foolish, and the idle talk of one who does not in the least see the omnipotence of God? Tell me, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, you who think that like things can only be produced from like things, whence was the origin of that unaccountable host of quails in the wilderness of old time to feed the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, for nowhere do we read that they had been previously born of mother birds, but that they were brought up and came suddenly. Again whence came that heavenly food which for forty years fell on the camp of the Hebrews? Did manna produce manna? But these refer to ancient <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. And what of more recent ones? With a few loaves and small fishes the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> fed countless hosts of the people that followed Him, and not once only. The reason that they were satisfied lay not in the food: for a secret and unseen <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> satisfied the hungry folk, especially as there was much more left when they were filled than there had been set before them when they were hungry. And how was all this brought about that when those who ate were satisfied, the food itself was multiplied by an extraordinary increase? We read that in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> wine was produced from water. Tell me how what was of one nature produced something of an altogether different substance from its own quality? Especially when (which exactly applies to the birth of the Lord) it was the production of a nobler substance from what was inferior to it? Tell me then how from mere water there could be produced rich and splendid wine? How was it that one thing was drawn out, another poured in? Was the cistern a well of such a nature as to change the water drawn from it into the best wine? Or did the character of the vessels or the diligence of the servants effect this? Most certainly neither of these. And how is it that the <em>manner</em> of the fact is not understood by the thoughts of the heart, though the <em><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></em> of the fact is firmly held by the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>? In the gospel clay was placed on the eyes of a blind man and when it was washed off  eyes were produced. Had water the power of giving birth to eyes, or clay of creating light? Certainly not, especially as water could be of no use to a blind man, and clay would actually hinder the sight of those who could see. And how was it that a thing that itself in its own nature was injurious, became the means of restoring health; and that what was ordinarily hurtful to sound people, was then made the instrument of healing? You say that the power of God brought it about, and the remedy of God caused it, and that all these things of which we have been speaking were simply brought about by Divine Omnipotence; which is able to fashion new things from unwonted material, and to make serviceable things out of their opposites, and to change what belongs to the realm of things impossible and impracticable into possibilities and actual performances.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p><strong>How God has shown His Omnipotence in His birth in time as well as in everything else.</strong></p>

<p>Confess then the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in respect of the actual nativity of the Lord, as in respect of everything else. Believe that God was born when He would, for you do not deny that He could do what He would; unless possibly you think that that power which belonged to Him for all other things was deficient as regards Himself, and that His Omnipotence though proceeding from Him and penetrating all things, was insufficient to bring about His own nativity. In the case of the Lord's nativity you bring this as an objection against me: No one gives birth to one who is anterior in time: and in regard of the birth which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> underwent you say that the one who is born ought to be of one substance with the one who bears; as if you had to do with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as in the case of any ordinary man, to whom you might bring the impossibility as an objection, as you include him in the weakness of earthly things. You say that for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> there are common conditions of birth, and but one law of generation; and that a thing could not possibly happen to one man only out of the whole of humanity, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has forbidden to happen to all. You do not understand of whom you are speaking; nor do you see of whom you are talking; for He is the Author of all conditions, and the very Law of all natures, through whom exists whatever man can do, and whatever man cannot do: for He certainly has laid down the limits of both; viz., how far his powers should extend, and the bounds beyond which his weakness should not advance. How wildly then do you bring <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> impossibilities as an objection in the case of Him, who possesses all powers and possibilities. If you estimate the Person of the Lord by earthly weaknesses, and measure God's Omnipotence by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> rules, you will most certainly fail to find anything which seems appropriate to God as concerns the sufferings of His Body. For if it can seem to you unreasonable that Mary could give birth to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who was anterior to her, how will it seem reasonable that God was crucified by men? And yet the same God who was crucified Himself predicted: <q>Shall a man afflict <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for you afflict Me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352603"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse8">Malachi&nbsp;3:8</a></span> If then we cannot think that the Lord was born of a Virgin because He who was born was anterior to her who bore Him, how can we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God had blood? And yet it was said to the Ephesian elders: <q>Feed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> which He has purchased with His own Blood.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352604"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse28">Acts&nbsp;20:28</a></span> Finally how can we think that the Author of life was Himself deprived of life: And yet Peter says: <q>You have killed the Author of life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352605"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;3:15</a></span> No one who is set on earth can be in heaven: and how does the Lord Himself say: <q>The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> who is in heaven</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note352606"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;3:13</a></span> If then you think that God was not born of a Virgin because the one who is born must be of one substance with the one who bears, how will you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that different things can be produced from different natures? Thus according to you the wind did not suddenly bring the quails, nor did the manna fall, nor was water turned into wine nor were many thousands of men fed with a few loaves, nor did the blind man receive his sight after the clay had been put on him. But if all these things seem incredible and contrary to nature, unless we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they were wrought by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why should you deny in the matter of His nativity, what you admit in the matter of His works? Or was He unable to contribute to His own nativity and advent what He did not refuse for the succour and profit of men?</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p><strong>He shows by proofs drawn from nature itself, that the law which his opponents lay down; viz., that the one born ought to be of one substance with the one who bears, fails to hold good in many cases.</strong></p>

<p>It would be tedious and almost childish to speak further on this subject. But still in order to refute that folly and <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of yours, in which you maintain that the one born ought to be of one substance with the one who bears, i.e., that nothing can produce something of a different nature to itself, I will bring forward some instances of earthly things, to convince you that many creatures are produced from things of a different nature. Not that it is possible or right to make any comparison in such a case as this: but that you may not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the possibility of that happening in the case of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Nativity, which as you see takes place in these frail earthly things. Bees, tiniest of creatures though they are, are yet so clever and cunning that we read that they can be produced and spring from things of an entirely different nature. For as they are creatures of marvellous intelligence, and well endowed not merely with sense but with foresight, they are produced from the gathered flowers of plants. What greater instance do you think can be produced and quoted? Living creatures are produced from inanimate: sensate from insensate.  What artificer, what architect was there? Who formed their bodies? Who breathed in their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>? Who gave them articulate sounds by which to converse with each other? Who fashioned and arranged these harmonies of their feet, the cunning of their mouths, the neatness of their wings? Their powers, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, foresight, movements, calmness, harmony, differences, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, peace, arrangements, contrivances, business, government, all those things indeed which they have in common with men&mdash; from whose teaching, or whose gift did they receive them? From whose implanting or instruction? Did they gain this through generation? Or learn it in their mother's womb or from her flesh? They never were in the womb, and had no experience of generation. It was only that flowers which they culled were brought into the hive and from this by a marvellous contrivance bees issued forth.  Then the womb of the mother imparted nothing to the offspring: nor are bees produced from bees. They are but their artificers, not their authors. From the blossoms of plants living creatures proceed. What is there akin in plants and animals? I fancy then that you see who is the contriver of those things. Go now and inquire whether the Lord could bring about that in the case of His own nativity, which you see that He procured in the case of these tiniest of creatures. Perhaps it is needless after this to add anything further. But still let us add in support of the argument what may not be necessary to prove the point. We see how the air is suddenly darkened, and the earth filled with locusts. Show me their seed&mdash; their birth&mdash; their mothers. For, as you see, they proceed thence, whence they have their birth. Assert in all these cases that the one who is born must be of one substance with the one who bears. And in these assertions you will be shown to be as silly, as you are wild in your denial of the Nativity of the Lord. And what next? Do even <em>you</em> think that we must go on any further? But still we will add something else. There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that basilisks are produced from the eggs of the birds which in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> they call the Ibis. What is there of kindred or relationship between a bird and a serpent? Why is the thing born not of one substance with that which bears it? And yet those who bear are not the authors of all these things, nor do those who are born understand them: but they result from secret causes, and from some inexplicable and manifold law of nature which produces them. And you are bringing as objections to His Nativity your petty assertions from earthly notions, while you cannot explain the origin of those things, which are produced by His bidding and command, whose will does everything, whose sway causes everything: whom nothing can oppose or resist; and whose will is sufficient for everything which can possibly be done.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.</h2>

<p><strong>He refutes another argument of Nestorius, in which he tried to make out that Christ was like Adam in every point.</strong></p>

<p>But since we cannot (as we should much prefer) ignore them, it is now time to expose the rest of your more subtle and insidious <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> that at least they may not deceive <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> folk. In one of your pestilent treatises you have maintained and said that <q>Since man is the image of the Divine nature, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> dragged this down and shattered it, God grieved over His image, as an Emperor over his <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, and repairs the shattered image: and formed without generation a nature from the Virgin, like that of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> who was born without generation; and raises up man's nature by means of man: for as by man came death, so also by man came the resurrection of the dead.</q> They tell us that some poisoners have a custom of mixing honey with the poison in the cups which they prepare; that the injurious ingredient may be concealed by the sweet: and while a man is charmed with the sweetness of the honey, he may be destroyed by the deadly poison. So then, when you say that man is the image of the Divine nature, and that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> dragged this down and shattered it, and that God grieved over His image as an Emperor over his <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, you smear (so to speak) the lips of the cup with something sweet like honey, that men may drain the cup offered to them, and not perceive its deadliness, while they taste what is alluring. You put forward God's name, in order to speak falsehoods in the name of religion. You set <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things in the front, in order to persuade men of what is untrue: and by means of your confession of God you contrive to deny Him whom you are confessing. For who is there who does not see whither you are going? What you are contriving? You say indeed that God grieved over His image as an Emperor over his <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, and repaired the shattered image, and formed without generation a nature from the Virgin, like that of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> who was born without generation, and raises up man's nature by man, for as by man came death, so also by man came the resurrection of the dead. So then with all your earnestness, with all your professions, you crafty plotter, you have managed by your smooth assertions, by naming God in the forefront, to come down to a (mere) man in the conclusion: and in the end you degrade Him to the condition of a mere man, from whom under colour of humility you have already taken away the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You say then that the Divine goodness has restored the image of God which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> shattered and destroyed, for you say that He restores the shattered image. Now with what craft you say that He restores the shattered image in order to persuade us that there was nothing more in Him, in whom the image is restored, than there was in the actual image, of which the restoration was brought about. And thus you make out that the Lord is only the same as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was: that the restorer of the image is nothing more than the actual destructible image. Finally in what follows you show what you are aiming and driving at, when you say that He formed without generation a nature from the Virgin like that of Adam, who was born without generation, and raises up man's nature by man. You maintain that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> was in all respects like Adam: that the one was without generation, and the other without generation: the one a mere man, and the other a mere man. And thus you see that you have carefully guarded and provided against our thinking of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> as in any way greater or better than Adam: since you have compared them together by the same standard, so that you would think that you detracted something from Adam's perfection, if you added anything more to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.</h2>

<p><strong>Heretics usually cover their doctrines with a cloak of holy Scripture.</strong></p>

<p><q>For as,</q> you say, <q>by man came death, so by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</q> Do you actually try to prove your wrong and impious notion by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the Apostle? And do you bring the <q>chosen vessel</q> into disgrace by mixing him up with your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> ideas? I mean, that, as you cannot understand the author of your Salvation, therefore the Apostle must be made out to have denied God. And yet, if you wanted to make use of Apostolic witnesses, why did you rest contented with one, and pass over all the others in silence? And why did you not at once add this: <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, an Apostle not of men neither by man, but by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352609"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;1:1</a></span> or this: <q>We speak wisdom among the perfect:</q> and presently: <q>Whom none,</q> says he, <q>of the princes of this world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>; for had they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, they would not have crucified the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352610"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:6,&nbsp;8</a></span> Or this: <q>For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352611"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse9">Colossians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> And: <q>One Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> through whom are all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352612"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:6</a></span> Or do you partly agree, and partly disagree with the Apostle, and only receive him so far as in consequence of the Incarnation  he names Christ man, and repudiate him where he speaks of Him as God? For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> does not deny that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is man, but still he confesses that man is God: and declares that to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> the resurrection came by man in such a way that he shows that in that man God arose. For see whether he declares that He who rose was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as he bears his <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that He who was crucified was the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.</h2>

<p><strong>The heretics attribute to Christ only the shadow of Divinity, and so assert that he is to be worshipped together with God but not as God.</strong></p>

<p>But still in order to avoid thinking of the Lord Jesus as one of the whole mass of people, you have given to Him some <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, by attributing to Him <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> as a saint, but not Deity as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. For what do you say? <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> brought about the Lord's Incarnation. Let us <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the form of the Theodochos  together with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as one form of Godhead, as a figure that cannot be severed from the Divine link, as an image of the unseen God.</q> Above you said that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, here you call Christ the image: the one you speak of as a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, and the other also as a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>. But I suppose we ought for God's <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to be grateful to you, because you grant that the form of the Theodochos should be worshipped together with God: in which you wrong Him rather than <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> Him. For in this you do not attribute to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Deity, but you deny it. By a subtle and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> art you say that He is to be worshipped together with God in order that you may not have to confess that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by the very statement in which you seem deceitfully to join Him with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you really sever Him from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For when you blasphemously say that He is certainly not to be adored as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to be worshipped together with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you thus grant to Him an union of nearness to Divinity, in order to get rid of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His Divinity. Oh, you most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and crafty enemy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you want to perpetrate the crime of denying God under pretext of confessing Him. You say: Let us worship Him as a figure that cannot be severed from the Divine will, as an image of the unseen God. It is I suppose, then, owing to His kind acts that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> has obtained among us <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> as Creator and Redeemer. If then we were redeemed by Him from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> destruction, in calling our Redeemer a figure we are endeavouring indeed to respond to His kindness and goodness, by a worthy service and a worthy allegiance, if we try to get rid of that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which He did not refuse to bring low for our sakes.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.</h2>

<p><strong>How those are wrong who say that the birth of Christ was a secret, since it was clearly shown even to the patriarch Jacob.</strong></p>

<p>But I suppose you excuse the degradation offered to the Lord by means of a subordinate <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, by the words <q>as the image of the secret God.</q> By the fact that you term Him an image you compare Him to man's estate. In speaking of Him as the image of the secret <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you detract from the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> plainly due to Him. For <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> says David, <q>shall plainly come; our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and shall not keep silence.</q>  And He surely came and did not keep silence, who before that He in His own person uttered anything after His birth, made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> His advent by both earthly and heavenly witnesses alike, while the star points Him out, the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> adore Him, and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> declare Him. What more do you want? His voice was yet silent on earth, and His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was already crying aloud in heaven. Do you say then that God was and is secret in Him? But this was not the announcement of the Prophets, of the Patriarchs, aye and of the whole Law. For they did not say that He would be secret, whose coming they all foretold. You <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in your wretched blindness, seeking grounds for <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and not finding them. You say that He was secret even after His advent. I maintain that He was not secret even before His advent. For did the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of God to be born of a Virgin escape the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that celebrated Patriarch on whom the vision of God present with him conferred a title, whereby from the name of Supplanter he rose to the name of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? Who, when from the struggle with the man who wrestled with him he understood the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Incarnation yet to come, said, <q>I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</q>  What, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, had he seen, for him to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he had seen God? Did God manifest Himself to him in the midst of thunder and lightning? Or when the heavens were opened, did the dazzling face of the Deity show itself to him? Most certainly not: but rather on the contrary he saw a man and acknowledged a God. O <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> worthy of the name he received, as with the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rather than of the body he earned the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of a title given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>! He saw a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form wrestling with him, and declared that he saw God. He certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form was indeed God: for in that form in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> then appeared, in the selfsame form He was in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> afterwards to come. Although why should we be surprised that so great a patriarch unhesitatingly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> what God Himself so plainly showed in His own Person to him, when he said, <q>I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved.</q> How did God show to him so much of the presence of Deity, that he could say that the face of God was shown to him? For it seems that only a man had appeared to him, whom he had actually beaten in the struggle. But God was certainly bringing this about by precursory signs, that there might not be any one to disbelieve that God was born of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when already long before the Patriarch had seen God in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p><strong>He collects more witnesses of the same fact.</strong></p>

<p>But why am I lingering so long over one instance, as if many were wanting? For even then how could the fact that God was to come in the flesh escape the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, when the Prophet said openly as if to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> of Him: <q>Behold your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and elsewhere: <q>Behold our God.</q> And this: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of Peace;</q> and: <q>of His kingdom there shall be no end.</q>  But also when He had already come, could the fact of His having come escape the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of those who openly confessed that He had come? Was Peter <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the coming of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he said, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352618"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;16:16</a></span> Did not Martha <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what she was saying or whom she <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in, when she said, <q>Yea, Lord, I have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has come into this world?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352619"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;11:27</a></span> And all those men, who sought from Him the cure of their sicknesses, or the restoration of their limbs, or the life of their dead, did they ask these things from man's weakness, or from God's omnipotence?</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p><strong>How the devil was forced by many reasons to the view that Christ was God.</strong></p>

<p>Finally as for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself, when he was tempting Him with every show of allurements, and every art of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, what was it that in his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> he suspected, or wanted to find out by tempting Him? Or what so greatly moved him, that he sought God under the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> form of man? Had he learned that by previous <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>? Or had he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of anyone who came as God in man's body? Most certainly not. But it was by the mighty evidence of signs, by mighty results of actions, by the words of the Truth Himself that he was driven to suspect and examine into this matter: inasmuch as he had already once heard from John: <q>Behold the Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, behold Him who takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352620"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;1:29</a></span> And again from the same person: <q>I have need to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by You, and You come to me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352621"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;3:14</a></span> The dove also which came down from heaven and stopped over the Lord's head had made itself a clear and open <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of a God who declared Himself. The voice too which was sent from God not in riddles or figures had moved him, when it said: <q>You are My beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in You I am well pleased.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352622"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;3:17</a></span> And though he saw a man outwardly in Jesus, yet he was searching for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, when he said: <q>If You are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, command that these stones be made bread.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352623"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;4:3</a></span> Did the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the man drive away the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> suspicions of His Divinity, so that owing to the fact that he saw a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He could be God? Most certainly not. But what does he say? <q>If You are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, command that these stones be made bread.</q> Certainly he had no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the possibility of that, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of which he was examining into. His anxiety was about its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. There was no security as to its impossibility.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p><strong>He compares this notion and reasonable suspicion of the devil with the obstinate and inflexible idea of his opponents, and shows that this last is worse and more blasphemous than the former.</strong></p>

<p>But he certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> was born of Mary: he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He was wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>: that His childhood was that of a poor person at the commencement of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life; and His infancy without the proper accessories of cradles: further he did not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that He had <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> flesh, and was born a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man. And why did this seem to him not enough for him to be secure in? Why did he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He could not be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be very man? Learn then, you wretched madman, learn, you lunatic, you cruel sinner, learn, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, even from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, to lessen your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. He said: <q>If You are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> You say: <q>You are not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> You deny what he asked about. No one was ever yet found but you, to outdo the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. That which he confessed to be possible in the case of the Lord, you do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to have been possible.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.</h2>

<p><strong>How the devil always retained this notion of Christ's Divinity (because of His secret working which he experienced) even up to His Cross and Death.</strong></p>

<p>But perhaps he afterwards ceased and rested, and when his <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> were vanquished  laid aside his suspicion because he found no result? Nay, it rather remained always in him, and even up to the very cross of the Lord the suspicion lasted in him and was increased by peculiar terrors. What need is there of anything further? Not even then did he cease to think of Him as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, after that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that such licence was granted to His persecutors against Him. But the crafty foe saw even in the midst of His bodily sufferings the signs of Divinity, and though he would have much preferred Him to be a (mere) man, was yet forced to suspect that He was God: for though he would have preferred to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what he wanted, yet he was driven by surest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> to that which he feared. And no wonder: for although he beheld Him spitted on, and scourged, and disgraced, and led to the Cross, yet he saw Divine powers abounding even in the midst of the indignities and wrongs; when the veil of the temple is rent, when the sun hides itself, the day is darkened, and all things feel the effects of the Passion: all things even, which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, acknowledge the work of Deity. And therefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> seeing this, and trembling, tried in every way to arrive at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His Godhead, even at the very death of the manhood, saying in the person of those who crucified Him: <q>If He be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, let Him come down now from the Cross, and we will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352624"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse42">Matthew&nbsp;27:42</a></span> He certainty perceived that by His bodily Passion our Lord God was working out the redemption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and also that by it he was being destroyed and subdued, while we were being redeemed and saved. And so the enemy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> wanted by every means and every wile to defeat that which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> was being done for the redemption of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. <q>If,</q> he says, <q>He be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, let Him come down now from the Cross and we will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him:</q> on purpose that the Lord might be moved by the reproach of the words, and destroy the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, while He avenged the wrong. You see then that the Lord even when hanging on the Cross was termed the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. You see that they suspect the fact to which they refer. And so do you learn, as I said above, even from His persecutors, even from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Who ever came up to the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? Who went beyond it? <em>He</em> suspected that He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> even when He endured death. <em>You</em> deny it even when He has risen. <em>He</em> suspected that He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from whom He hid Himself. <em>You</em>, to whom He has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> it, deny it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.</h2>

<p><strong>He shows how heretics pervert holy Scripture, by replying to the argument drawn from the Apostle's words, <q>Without father, without mother,</q> etc.: <a href="../bible/heb007.htm">Heb. vii.</a></strong></p>

<p>You then make use of the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and try to bring His own witnesses against Him. But how? Truly so as to become a false accuser not only of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but of the evidences themselves. Nor indeed is it wonderful that, as you cannot do what you want, you only do what you can: as you cannot turn the sacred witnesses against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you do what you can, and pervert them. For you say: Then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> tells a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, when he says of Christ: <q>Without mother, without genealogy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352625"><a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse3">Hebrews&nbsp;7:3</a></span> I ask you, of whom do you think that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said this? Of the Son and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, whom you separate from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and blasphemously assert to be a mere man? If of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, whom you maintain to be a mere man, how could a man be born without a mother and without a genealogy on the mother's side? But if of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>&mdash; what can we make of it, when the same Apostle, your own <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, as you impiously <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, testifies in the same place and by the same <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that He whom you assert to be without mother, was also without father; saying, <q>Without father, without mother, without genealogy</q>? It follows then that if you use the Apostle's <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, since you assert that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was <q>without mother,</q> you must also be guilty of the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> that He was <q>without father.</q> You see then in what a downfall of impiety you have landed yourself, in your eagerness for your perversity and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, so that, while you say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> had not a mother, you must also deny Him a Father&mdash; a thing which no one yet since the world began, except perhaps a madman, ever did. And this, whether with greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> or folly, I hardly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; for what is more foolish and silly than to give the name of Son and to try to keep back the name of Father? But you say I don't keep it back, I don't deny it. And what <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> then drove you to quote that passage, where, while you say that He had no mother, you must seem also to deny to Him a Father? For as in the same passage He is said to be without mother and also without father, it follows that if it can be understood that there He is without mother, in the same way in which we understand that He is without mother, we must also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is without father. But that hasty craze for denying God did not see this; and when it quoted mutilated, what was written entire, it failed to see that the shameless and palpable lie could be refuted by laying open the contents of the sacred volume. O foolish <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>! Which, while it failed to see what it ought to follow, had not the wit to see even what could be read: as if, because it could get rid of its own intelligence, it could get rid of the power of reading from everybody else, or as if everybody would lose their eyes in their heads for reading, because it had lost the eyes of the mind. Hear then, you <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, the passage you have garbled: hear in full and completely, what you quoted mutilated and hacked about. The Apostle wants to make clear to every one the twofold birth of God&mdash; and in order to show how the Lord was born in the Godhead and in flesh, he says, <q>Without father, without mother:</q> for the one belongs to the birth of Divinity, the other to that of the flesh. For as He was begotten in His Divine nature <q>without mother,</q> so He is in the body <q>without father:</q> and so though He is neither without father nor without mother, we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him <q>without father and without mother.</q> For if you regard Him as He is begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He is without mother: if, as born of His mother, He is without father. And so in each of these births He has one: in both together He is without each: for the birth of Divinity had no need of mother, and for the birth of His body, He was Himself sufficient, without a father. Therefore says the Apostle <q>Without mother, without genealogy.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 15.</h2>

<p><strong>How Christ could be said by the Apostle to be without genealogy.</strong></p>

<p>How does he say that the Lord was <q>without genealogy,</q> when the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the Evangelist Matthew begins with the Saviour's genealogy, saying: <q>The book of the generations of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Son of David, the Son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a></q>? <span class="stiki" id="note352626"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;1:1</a></span> Therefore according to the Evangelist He has a genealogy, and according to the Apostle, He has not: for according to the Evangelist, He has it on the mother's side, according to the Apostle He has not, as He springs from the Father. And so the Apostle well says: <q>Without father, without mother, without genealogy:</q> and where he lays down that He was begotten without mother, there also he records that He was without genealogy. And thus as regards both the nativities of the Lord, the writings of the Evangelist and of the Apostle agree together. For according to the Evangelist He has a genealogy <q>without father,</q> when born in the flesh: and according to the Apostle, the Lord has not, when begotten in His Divine nature <q>without mother;</q> as Isaiah says: <q>But who shall declare His generation?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352627"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;53:8</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 16.</h2>

<p><strong>He shows that like the devil when tempting Christ, the heretics garble and pervert holy Scripture.</strong></p>

<p>Why then, you <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, did you not in this way quote the whole and entire passage which you had read? So you see that the Apostle laid down that the Lord was <q>without mother</q> in the same way in which he laid down that He was born <q>without father:</q> that we might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He is <q>without mother</q> in the same way in which we understand Him to be <q>without father.</q> And as it is impossible to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to be altogether <q>without father,</q> so we cannot understand that He is altogether <q>without mother.</q> Why then, you <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, did you not in this way quote what you had read in the Apostle, entire and unmutilated? But you insert part, and omit part; and garble the words of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in order that you may be able to build up your false notions by your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> act. I see who was your master. We must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you had <em>his</em> instruction, whose example you are following. For so the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in the gospel when tempting the Lord said: <q>If You are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, cast Yourself down. For it is written that He shall give His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> charge concerning You to keep You in all Your ways.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352628"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;4:9-10</a></span> And when he had said this, he left out the context and what belongs to it; viz., <q>You shall walk upon the asp and the basilisk: and you shall trample under foot the lion and the dragon.</q>  Surely he cunningly quoted the previous verse and left out the latter: for he quoted the one to deceive Him: he held his tongue about the latter to avoid condemning himself. For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he himself was signified by the asp and basilisk, the lion and dragon in the Prophet's words. So then you also bring forward a part and omit a part; and quote the one to deceive; and omit the other for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest if you were to quote the whole, you might condemn your own deception. But it is now time to pass on to further matters, for by dwelling too long on particular points, as we are led to do by the desire of giving a full answer, we exceed the limits even of a longish book.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.</h2>

<p><strong>That the glory and honour of Christ is not to be ascribed to the Holy Ghost in such a way as to deny that it proceeds from Christ Himself, as if all that excellency, which was in Him, was another's and proceeded from another source.</strong></p>

<p>You say then in another discussion, nay rather in another <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of yours, and He separated  the Spirit from the Divine nature Who created His humanity. For <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says that that which was born of Mary is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note352631"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;1:20</a></span> Who also filled with righteousness (justitia) that which was created: for it says 'He appeared in the flesh, was justified in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note352632"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:16</a></span> Again: Who made Him also to be feared by the devils: 'For I,' He says, 'by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> cast out devils.' <span class="stiki" id="note352633"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;11:20</a></span> Who also made His flesh a temple. 'For I saw His spirit descending like a dove and abiding upon Him.' <span class="stiki" id="note352634"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse32">John&nbsp;1:32</a></span> Again: Who granted to Him His ascension into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. For it says, <q>Giving a commandment to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> whom He had chosen, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> He was taken up.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352635"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;1:2</a></span> Finally that it was He who granted such <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The whole of your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> then consists in this: that Christ had nothing of Himself: nor did He, a mere man, as you say, receive anything from the Word, i.e., the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; but everything in Him was the gift of the Spirit. If then we can show that all that which you refer to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, is His own, what remains but that we prove that He whom you therefore would have taken to be a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, because as you say everything which He has is another's, is therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because everything which He has is His own? And indeed we will prove this not only by discussion and argument, but by the voice of Divinity Itself: for nothing testifies of God better than things divine. And because nothing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself better than the very <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> nothing on the subject of God with greater right than those writings in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself is His own <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. First then, as to this that you say that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> created His humanity; we might take it simply, if we could acknowledge that you had not brought it forward in the interests of unbelief. For neither do we deny that the flesh of the Lord was conceived by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: but we assert that the body was conceived by the co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in such a way that we can say that His Humanity  was created for Himself by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> Itself says in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, testifying that <q>Wisdom has built for Itself a house.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352637"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;9:1</a></span> You see then that that which was conceived by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was built and perfected by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>: not that the work of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is one thing, and the work of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> another: but that through the unity of the Godhead and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> the operation of the Spirit is the building of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and the building of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is the co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And so we read not only that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came upon the Virgin, but also that the power of the Most High overshadowed the Virgin; that since Wisdom Itself is the fullness of the Godhead, no one might <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that when Wisdom built Itself a house all the fullness of the Godhead was present. But the wretched hardness of your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, while it tries to sever Christ from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, fails to see that it is entirely severing the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Godhead from Itself. Unless perhaps you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the house is therefore built for Him by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> because He Himself was insufficient and incapable of building for Himself an house. But it is as absurd as it is wild, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He, whom we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to have created the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> of things heavenly and earthly by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, was unable to build for Himself a body: especially as the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is His power, and the Divinity and Glory of the Trinity are so united and inseparable, that we cannot think of anything at all in One Person of the Trinity, which can be separated from the fullness of the Godhead. Therefore when this is laid down and grasped; viz., that according to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came upon (the Virgin) and the power of the Most High overshadowed her, Wisdom built Itself an house; the rest of the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> of your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> come to nothing. For neither is it doubtful that He made all things by Himself and in Himself, in whose name and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> even of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> can do anything. For neither did He need the aid of another, as neither have they needed it, who have trusted in His power. And so as for your assertions that He was justified by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and that the Spirit made Him to be feared by the devils, and that His flesh became the temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and that He was taken up by the Spirit into heaven, they are all <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> and wild: not because we are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that in all these things which He Himself did, the unity and cooperation of the Spirit was wanting&mdash; since the Godhead is never wanting to Itself, and the power of the Trinity was ever present in the Saviour's works&mdash; but because you will have it that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> gave assistance to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> as if He had been feeble and powerless; and that He granted those things to Him, which He was unable to procure for Himself. Learn then from sacred witnesses to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not to mingle <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: for the subject does not admit it, and common sense abhors the idea of mingling the notions of the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> with the witnesses that are Divine.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.</h2>

<p><strong>How we are to understand the Apostle's words: <q>He appeared in the flesh, was justified in the Spirit,</q> etc.</strong></p>

<p>For to begin with this assertion of yours that the Spirit filled with righteousness (justitia) what was created, and your attempts to prove this by the evidence of the Apostle, where he says that <q>He appeared in the flesh, was justified in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>,</q> you make each statement in an unsound sense and wild spirit. For you make this assertion; viz., that you will have it that He was filled with righteousness by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, in order to show how He was void of righteousness, as you assert that the being filled with it was given to Him. And as for your use of the evidence of the Apostle on this matter, you garble the arrangement and meaning of the sacred passage. For the Apostle's statement is not as you have quoted it, mutilated and spoilt. For what says the Apostle? <q>And evidently great is the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Godliness, which was manifested in the flesh, was justified in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352638"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:16</a></span> You see then that the Apostle declared that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> or sacrament of Godliness was justified. For he was not so forgetful of his own words and teaching as to say that He was void of righteousness, whom he had always proclaimed as righteousness, saying: <q>Who was made unto us righteousness and sanctification and redemption.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352639"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse30">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:30</a></span> Elsewhere also he says: <q>But you were washed, but you were justified, but you were sanctified in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352640"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:11</a></span> How far then from Him was it to need being filled with righteousness, as He Himself filled all things with righteousness, and for His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to be without righteousness, whose very name justifies all things. You see then how foolish and wild are your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, since you are trying to take away from our Lord what is ever shed forth by Him upon all <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in such a way that still in its continuous supply it is never diminished.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.</h2>

<p><strong>That it was not only the Spirit, but Christ Himself also who made Him to be feared.</strong></p>

<p>You say too that the Spirit made Him to be feared by the devils. To reject and refute which, even though the horrible character of the utterance is enough, we will still add some instances. Tell me, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, you who say that the fact that the devils feared Him was not His own doing but another's, and who will have it that this was not His own power but a gift, how was it that even His name had that power, of which He Himself was, according to you, void? How was it that in His name devils were cast out, sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were cured, dead men were raised? For the Apostle Peter says to that lame man who was sitting at the beautiful gate of the Temple: <q>In the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> arise and walk.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352641"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse6">Acts&nbsp;3:6</a></span> And again in the city of Joppa to the man who had been lying on his bed paralysed for eight years he says, <q>&AElig;neas, may the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> heal you: arise and make your bed for yourself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352642"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse34">Acts&nbsp;9:34</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> too says to the pythonical spirit: <q>I charge you in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> come out of her,</q> and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> came out of her. <span class="stiki" id="note352643"><a href="../bible/act016.htm#verse18">Acts&nbsp;16:18</a></span> But understand from this how utterly alien this weakness was from our Lord: for I do not call even those weak, whom He by His name made strong, since we never heard of any <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> or infirmity able to resist any of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> since the Lord's resurrection. How then did the Spirit make Him to be feared, who made others to be feared? Or was He in Himself weak, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> even through the instrumentality of others reigned over all things? Finally those men who received power from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, never used that power as if it were their own: but referred the power to Him from whom they received it: for the power itself could never have any force except through the name of Him who gave it. And so both the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and all the servants of God never did any thing in their own name, but in the name and invocation of Christ: for the power itself derived its force from the same source as its origin, and could not be given through the instrumentality of the ministers, unless it had come from the Author. You then&mdash; who say that the Lord was the same as one of His servants (for as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had nothing but what they received from their Lord, so you make out that the Lord Himself had nothing but what He received from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; and thus you make out that everything that He had, He had not as Lord, but had received it as a servant), do you tell me then, how it was that He used this power as His own and not as something which He had received? For what do we read of Him? He says to the paralytic: <q>Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352644"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;9:6</a></span> And again to a father who pleads on behalf of his child, He says: <q>Go your way: your son lives.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352645"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse50">John&nbsp;4:50</a></span> And where an only son of his mother was being carried forth for burial, <q>Young man,</q> He says, <q>I say unto you Arise.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352646"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;7:14</a></span> Did He then like those who received power from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ask that power might be given to Him for performing these things by the invocation of the Divine Name? Why did He not Himself work by the name of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> wrought by His Name? Finally, what does the gospel itself state about Him? It says: <q>He was teaching them as one that had authority, and not like the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352647"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;7:29</a></span> Or do you make out that He was so <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> as to put to the credit of His own might the power which (according to you) He had received from God? But what do we make of the fact that the power never submitted to His servants, except through the name of its author, and could have no efficacy if the actor claimed any of it as his own?</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.</h2>

<p><strong>He tries by stronger and weightier arguments to destroy that notion.</strong></p>

<p>But why are we so long dealing with your wild <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, with arguments that are plain indeed but still slight? Let us hear God Himself speaking to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <q>Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, cast out devils.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352648"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;10:8</a></span> And again: <q>In My name,</q> He says, <q>you shall cast out devils.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352649"><a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse17">Mark&nbsp;16:17</a></span> Had He any need of Another's name for the exercise of His power, who made His own name to be a power? But what is still added? <q>Behold,</q> He says, <q>I have given you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and upon all the power of the enemy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352650"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;10:19</a></span> He Himself says that He was gentle, as indeed He was, and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> in heart. And how was it that as regards the greatest possible power, He commanded others to work in His own name, if He Himself worked in Another's name? Or did He give to others, as if it were His own, what He Himself, according to you, did not possess, unless He received it from Another? But tell me, which of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> receiving power from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so worked? Or would not Peter have been thought a lunatic, or John a madman, or <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> out of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, if they had said to any sick folk: <q>In our name arise;</q> or to the lame: <q>In our name walk;</q> or to the dead: <q>In our name live;</q> or this to some: <q>We give you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and upon all the power of the enemy</q>? You see then from this your <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>: for just as these words are mad if they spring from man's assurance, so are you utterly mad if you do not see that they come from Divine power. For you must admit one of two alternatives; either that man could possess and give Divine power, or at any rate if no man can do this, that He who could do it, was God. For no one can grant of His liberality Divine power, except Him who possesses it by nature.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.</h2>

<p><strong>That it must be ascribed equally to Christ and the Holy Ghost that His flesh and Humanity became the temple of God.</strong></p>

<p>But there follows in your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> that His flesh was made a temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, for this reason, that John has said: <q>For I saw the Spirit descending from heaven and abiding upon Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352651"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse32">John&nbsp;1:32</a></span> For you try to support even this wild statement of yours by Scriptural authority: wherefore let us see whether this sacred authority has said that which you say. <q>For I saw,</q> it says, <q>the Spirit descending like a dove, and abiding upon Him.</q> Discern here, if you can, which is the more powerful, which greater, which more to be honoured? He who descended, or He to whom the descent was made? He who brought down the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, or He to whom the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> was brought? Where do you find in this passage that the Spirit made His flesh a temple? Or wherein does it lessen the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if God Himself descended to show God to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>? For certainly we ought not to think that He is less whose high estate was pointed out, than He who pointed out His high estate. But away with the thought of believing or making any separation in the Godhead: for one and the same Godhead and equal power shut out altogether the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> notion of inequality. And so in this matter, where there is the Person of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and where it is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to whom the descent is made, the Spirit who descends, the Father who gives His <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, no one had more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and no one received any slight, but it all redounds equally to the fullness of the Godhead, for each Person of the Trinity contains within Himself the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the whole Trinity. And so nothing further needs to be said, except only to show the rise and origin of your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. For thorns and thistles springing up from the roots produce shoots of their own nature, and from their character show their origin. So then you also, a thorny offshoot of the Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, show in germ just the same that your father is said to have had in the root. For he  (as Leporius his follower said) declared that our Lord was made the Christ by His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: you say that at His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> He was made the temple of God by the Spirit. The words are not altogether identical: but the wrong-headedness is altogether the same.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.</h2>

<p><strong>That the raising up of Christ into heaven is not to be ascribed to the Spirit alone.</strong></p>

<p>But you add this also to those impieties of yours mentioned above; viz., that the Spirit granted to the Lord His ascension into heaven: showing by this <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> notion of yours that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> was so weak and powerless that had not the Spirit raised Him up to heaven, you fancy that He would still at this day have been on earth. But to prove this assertion you bring forward a passage of Scripture: for you say <q>Giving commands to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> whom He had chosen, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> He was raised up.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352653"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;1:2</a></span> What am I to call you? What am I to think of you who by corrupting the sacred writings contrive that their evidences should not have the force of evidences? A new kind of audacity, which strives by its impious arguments to manage that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may seem to confirm <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. For the Acts of the Apostles does not say what you make out. For what says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>? <q>What Jesus began to do and to teach until the day in which giving charge to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> whom He had chosen by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, He was taken up.</q> Which is an instance of Hyperbaton, and must be understood in this way: what Jesus began to do and to teach until the day in which he was taken up, giving charge to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> whom He had chosen by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; so that we ought not perhaps to have to give you any further answer in this matter than that of the passage itself, for the entire passage ought to be sufficient for the full <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, if the mutilation of it was available for your <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. But still, you, who think that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> could not have ascended into heaven, unless He had been raised up by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; tell me how is it that He Himself says <q>No one has ascended into heaven but He who came down from heaven, even the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> who is in heaven</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note352654"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;3:13</a></span> Confess then how foolish and absurd your notion is that He could not ascend into heaven, who is said, although He had descended into earth, never to have been absent from heaven: and say whether to leave the regions below and ascend into heaven was possible for Him to whom it was easy when still on earth, ever to continue in heaven. But what is that which He Himself says: <q>I ascend unto my Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352655"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;20:17</a></span> Did He imply that in this ascension there would be the intervention of Another's help, who by the very fact that He said He would ascend, shows the efficacy of His own power? David also says of the Ascension of the Lord: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ascended with a merry noise, the Lord with the sound of the trumpet:</q>  He clearly explained the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him who ascends by the power of the ascension.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.</h2>

<p><strong>He continues the same argument to show that Christ had no need of another's glory as He had a glory of His own.</strong></p>

<p>But to end let us see the addition with which you sum up your preceding <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>. Your words are, <q>Who gave such  <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to Christ?</q> You name <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in order to degrade Him. For by the assertion that the Lord was endowed with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in saying that He received it you blasphemously imply that He stood in need of it. For your perverse notion suggests that the generosity of the giver shows the need of the receiver. O miserable impiety of yours! And where is that which Divinity itself once foretold of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> ascending into heaven? Saying: <q>Lift up your heads, and the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall come in.</q>  And when He (after the fashion of Divine utterances) had made answer to Himself as if in the character of an inquirer: <q>Who is the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?</q> at once He adds: <q>The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle:</q> showing under the figure of a battle fought, the victory of the Lord in His triumph. Then when, to complete the exposition of it, He had repeated the words of the utterance quoted above, He showed by the following conclusion the majesty of the Lord as He entered heaven, saying <q>The Lord of hosts, He is the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> On purpose that the fact of His taking a body might not interfere with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His mighty Divinity, He taught that the same Person was Lord of hosts and King of heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, whom He had previously proclaimed Victor in the battle below. Go now  and say that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was given to the Lord, when both <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> has said that He was the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and He Himself also has testified of Himself as follows: <q>When the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall come in His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352660"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;25:31</a></span> Refute it, if you can, and contradict this; viz., that whereas He testifies that He has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His own, you say that He has received Another's. Although we maintain that He has His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in such a way that we do not deny that His very property of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is common to Him with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For whatever God possesses belongs to the Godhead: and the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in such a way that it is not kept back from belonging to the entire Godhead.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.</h2>

<p><strong>He supports this doctrine by the authority of the blessed Hilary.</strong></p>

<p>But it is quite time to finish the book, aye and the whole work, if I may however add the sayings of a few saintly men and illustrious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, to support by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the present day what we have already <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the authority of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture. Hilary, a man endowed with all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and graces, and famous for his life as well as for his eloquence, who also, as a teacher of the churches and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, advanced not only by his own merits but also by the progress of others, and remained so steadfast during the storms of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> that through the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of his unconquered <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he attained the dignity of being a Confessor, &mdash; he testifies in the First book on the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, Very God of Very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was both begotten before the world, and afterwards born as man. Again in the Second book: <q>One only Begotten God grew in the womb of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin into the form of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body; He who contains all things, and in whose power all things are, is brought forth according to the law of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> birth.</q> Again in the same book: <q>An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that He who is born is God with us.</q> Again in the Tenth book: <q>We have taught the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of God born as man by the birth from the Virgin.</q> Again in the same book: <q>For when God was born as man, He was not born on purpose not to remain God.</q>  Again in the same writer's preface to his exposition of the gospel according to Matthew:  <q>For to begin with it was needful for us that for our sakes the only Begotten God should be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be born as man.</q> Again in what follows: <q>that besides being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He should be born as man, which He was not yet.</q> Again in the same place: <q>Then this third matter was fitting: that as God was born as man in the world</q> etc.: Here are a few passages out of any number. But still you see even from these which we have quoted, how clearly and plainly he asserts that God was born of Mary. And where then is this saying of yours: <q>The creature could not bring forth the Creator: and that which is born of the flesh, is flesh.</q> It would take too long to quote passages bearing on this point from each separate writer. I must try to enumerate them rather than to explain them: for they will sufficiently explain themselves.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25.</h2>

<p><strong>He shows that Ambrose agrees with S. Hilary.</strong></p>

<p>Ambrose, that illustrious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who never leaving the Lord's hand, ever shone like a jewel upon the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thus speaks in his book to the Virgins: <q>My brother is white and ruddy.  White because He is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father: ruddy because He was born of the Virgin. But remember that in Him the tokens of Divinity are of longer standing than the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the body. For He did not begin to exist from the Virgin, but He who was already in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, came into the Virgin.</q>  Again on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>: See the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the mother of the Lord: A Virgin conceived, a Virgin brought forth. She was a Virgin when she conceived, a Virgin when with child, a Virgin after the birth. As is said in Ezekiel: <q>And the gate was shut and not opened, because the Lord passed through it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352666"><a href="../bible/eze044.htm#verse2">Ezekiel&nbsp;44:2</a></span> A splendid Virginity, and wondrous fruitfulness! The Lord of the world is born: and there are no cries from her who brought Him forth. The womb is left empty, and a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> child is born, and yet the Virginity is not destroyed. It was right that when God was born the power of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> should become greater, and that her purity should not be violated by the going forth of Him who had come to heal what was corrupt.  Again in his exposition of the gospel according to Luke he says that <q>one was especially chosen, to bring forth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who was espoused to an husband.</q>  He certainly declares that God was born of the Virgin. He calls Mary the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And where is that awful and execrable utterance of yours asking how can she be the mother of one of a different nature from her own. But if she is called mother by them, it is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which was born not the Godhead. So, that illustrious teacher of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> says both that she who bare Him was <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and that He who was born is God: and yet that this is no reason for unbelief, but only a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.</h2>

<p><strong>He adds to the foregoing the testimony of S. Jerome.</strong></p>

<p>Jerome, the Teacher of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, whose writings shine like divine lamps throughout the whole world, says in his book to <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>: <q>The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was made the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>. He waits ten months in the womb to be born: and He, in whose hand the world is held, is contained in a narrow <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>.</q>  Again in his commentary on Isaiah: <q>For the Lord of hosts, who is the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, Himself descended into the Virgin's womb, and entered in and went forth from the East Gate which is ever shut.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note352670"><a href="../bible/eze044.htm#verse2">Ezekiel&nbsp;44:2</a></span> Of whom Gabriel says to the Virgin: <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon you, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow you. Wherefore that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing which shall be born of you shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> And in Proverbs: <q>Wisdom has built herself an house.</q>  Compare this if you please with your doctrine or rather your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, in which you assert that God is the Creator of the months, and was not an offspring of months. For lo, Jerome, a man of the greatest <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and also of the most pure and approved doctrine testifies almost in the very words in which you deny that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was an offspring of months, that He was an offspring of months. For he says that He waits ten months in the womb to be born. But perhaps the authority of this man seems a mere nothing to you. You may take it that every one says the same and in the same words, for whoever does not deny that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is the offspring of the Virgin, admits that He is the offspring of months.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27.</h2>

<p><strong>To the foregoing he adds Rufinus and the blessed Augustine.</strong></p>

<p>Rufinus also, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, with no mean place among Ecclesiastical Doctors testifies as follows of the Lord's Nativity in his Exposition of the Creed. <q>For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</q> he says, <q>is born of a Virgin, not chiefly allied to the flesh alone, but generated in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is the medium between the flesh and God.</q>  Does he <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> obscurely that God was born of man? Augustine the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>  of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo Regiensis</a> says: <q>That men might be born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, God was first born of them: for Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And Christ when born of men only required a mother on earth, because He always had a Father in heaven, being born of God through whom we are made, and also born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, through whom we might be re-created.</q>  Again, in this place: <q>And the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a> and dwelt among us. Why then need you wonder that men are born of God? Notice how God Himself was born of men.</q> Again in his Epistle to Volusianus: But <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> prophesied of Christ the Lord, and gave Him great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: they declared that He would come not as one like themselves, nor merely greater in the same sort of power of working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but clearly as the Lord God of all, and as made man for men. Who therefore Himself also willed to do such things as they did to prevent the absurdity of His not doing Himself those things which He did through them. But still it was right also for Him to do something special; viz., to be born of a Virgin, to rise from the dead, to ascend into heaven. And if anyone thinks that this is too little for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what more he can look for. </p>

<h2>Chapter 28.</h2>

<p><strong>As he is going to produce the testimony of Greek or Eastern Bishops, he brings forward in the first place S. Gregory Nazianzen.</strong></p>

<p>But perhaps because those whom we have enumerated came from different parts of the world, their authority may seem to you less valuable. An absurd thing, indeed, because <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not interfered with by place, and we have to consider <em>what</em> a man is, not <em>where</em>: especially since religion unites all together, and those who are in the one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be in the one body. But still we will bring forward for you some, whom you cannot despise, even from the East. Gregory, that most grand light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and doctrine, who though he has been for some time dead, yet still lives in authority and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and though he has been for some time removed in the body from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, yet has not forsaken them in word and authority. <q>When then,</q> he says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had come forth from the Virgin, in that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which He had taken, as He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in one out of two which are the opposite of each other; viz., flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, the one is taken into <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other exalts into the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Deity.  O new and unheard of intermingling! O marvellous and exquisite union! He who was, came to be, and the Creator is created: and He who is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> is embraced by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is the medium between God and the flesh: and He who makes all rich, is made poor.</q> Again he says of the Epiphany: <q>But what happens? What is done concerning us and for us? There is brought about some new and unheard of change of natures and God is made man.</q> Again in this passage:  <q>The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> began to be also the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, not being changed from what He was, for He is unchangeable, but taking to Himself what He was not: for He is pitiful so that He, who could not be embraced, can now be embraced.</q> You see how grandly and nobly he asserts the majesty of His Godhead so that He may bring in the condescension of the Incarnation: for that admirable teacher of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> well that of all the blessings which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> granted to us at His coming into the world this was the chief, without diminishing in any way His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For whatever God gave to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, ought to increase the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Him in us, and not to lessen the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which we give to Him.</p>

<p><strong>In the next place he puts the authority of S. Athanasius.</strong></p>

<p>Athanasius also, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the city of Alexandria, a splendid instance of constancy and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whom the storm of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> tested without crushing him: whose life was always like a clear glass, and who had almost obtained the reward of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> before attaining the dignity of confessorship: Let us see what was his view of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> and the mother of the Lord. <q>This then,</q> he says, <q>is the mind and stamp of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, as we have often said; viz., that in one and the same Saviour two things have to be understood: (1) that He was ever <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is Son, Word, and Light, and Wisdom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and (2) that afterwards for our sakes He took flesh of the Virgin Mary the Theotocos, and was made man.</q>  Again after some other matter: <q>Many then were <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and clean from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: Jeremiah also was sanctified from the womb, and John, while still in the womb leapt for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at the voice of Mary the Theotocos.</q>  He certainly says that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who (to declare the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of all in his words) is <q>the Word, and Light and Wisdom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> took flesh for our sakes; and therefore he calls the Virgin Mary Theotocos, because she was the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30.</h2>

<p><strong>He adds also S. John Chrysostom.</strong></p>

<p>As for John the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Episcopate of Constantinople, whose <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life obtained the reward of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> without any show of Gentile <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, hear what he thought and taught on the Incarnation of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>: <q>And Him,</q> he says, <q>whom if He had come in unveiled Deity neither the heaven nor the earth nor the sea nor any other creature could have contained, the pure womb of a Virgin bore.</q>  This man's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and doctrine then, even if you ignore that of others, you ought to follow and hold, as out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and affection for him the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> people chose you as their Bishop. For when it took you for its <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> from the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a>, from which it had formerly chosen him, it <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that it would receive in you all that it had lost in him.  Did not, I ask you, all these almost with prophetic spirit say all these things in order to confound your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>. For you declare that our Lord and Saviour Christ is not God: they declare that Christ the Lord is Very God. You blasphemously assert that Mary is Christotocos not Theotocos: they do not deny that she is Christotocos, while they acknowledge her as Theotocos. Not merely the substance but the words also are opposed to your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>: that we may clearly see that an impregnable bulwark was formerly prepared by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> against your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, to break on the wall of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> ready prepared, the force of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> attack which was at some time or other to come. And you, O you most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and shameless contaminator of an illustrious city, you disastrous and deadly plague of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people, do you dare to stand and teach in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, and with your wild and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> words <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of an ever unbroken <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> confession, and say that the people of the city of Constantinople are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> through the fault of their earlier teachers? Are you then the corrector of former Bishops, the accuser of ancient <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, are you better than Gregory, more approved than Nectarius, greater than John,  and all the other Bishops of Eastern cities who, though not of the same renown as those whom I have enumerated, were yet of the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Which, as far as the matter in hand is concerned, is enough: for when it is a question of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, all are as good as the best in so far as they agree with the best.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31.</h2>

<p><strong>He bemoans the unhappy lot of Constantinople, owing to the misfortune which has overtaken it from that heretic; and at the same time he urges the citizens to stand fast in the ancient Catholic and ancestral faith.</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Wherefore</span> I also, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and insignificant as I am in name as in desert, and although I cannot claim a place as Teacher among those illustrious Bishops of Constantinople, yet venture to claim the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and enthusiasm of a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. For I was admitted into the sacred ministry by the Bishop John, of blessed memory, and offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and even though I am absent in body yet I am still there in heart: and though by actual presence I no longer mix with that most dear and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet I am still joined to them in spirit. And hence it comes that condoling and sympathizing with them, I broke out just now into the utterance of our common grief and sorrow, and in my weakness cried out (which was all that I could do) by means of the dolorous lamentation of my works, as if for my own limbs and members: for if as the Apostle says, when the smaller part of the body is grieved, the greater part grieves and sympathizes with it, <span class="stiki" id="note352683"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:26</a></span> how much more should the smaller part sympathize when the greater part is grieved? It is indeed utterly inhuman for the smaller parts not to feel the sufferings of the greater in one and the same body, if the greater feel those of the smaller. Wherefore I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and beseech you, you who live within the circuit of Constantinople, and who are my fellow citizens through the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of my country, and my brothers through the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; separate yourselves from that ravening wolf who (as it is written) devours the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as if they were bread.  Touch not, taste not anything of his, for all those things lead to death. Come out from the midst of him and be separate and touch not the unclean thing. Remember your ancient teachers, and your <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; Gregory whose fame was spread through the world, Nectarius renowned for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, John a marvel of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and purity. John, I say; that John who like John the Evangelist was indeed a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and an Apostle; and so to speak ever reclined on the breast and heart of the Lord. Remember him, I say. Follow him. Think of his purity, his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, his doctrine, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Remember  him ever as your teacher and nurse, in whose bosom and embraces you as it were grew up. Who was the teacher in common both of you and of me: whose <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and pupils we are. Read his writings. Hold fast his instruction. Embrace his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and merits. For though to attain this is a hard and magnificent thing: yet even to follow is beautiful and sublime. For in the highest matters, not merely the attainment, but even the attempt to copy is worthy of praise. For scarcely anyone entirely misses all parts in that to which he is trying to climb and reach. He then should ever be in your minds and almost in your sight: he should live in your hearts and in your thoughts. He would himself commend to you this that I have written, for it was he who taught me what I have written: and so do not think of this as mine, so much as his: for the stream comes from the spring, and whatever you think belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, ought all to be referred to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the master. But, beyond and above all I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with all my heart and voice, to You, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, that You would fill with the gift of Your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> whatever we have written by Your bounteous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And because, as the Lord our God Your Only Begotten Son Himself taught us, You have so loved this world as to send Your Only Begotten Son to save the world, grant to Your people whom You have redeemed that in the Incarnation of Your Only Begotten Son they may perceive both Your gift and His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: and that all may understand the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that for us Your Only Begotten, our Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was born and suffered and rose again, and may so <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it that the condescension of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> may increase our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: and let not His Humility lead to a diminution of His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in the hearts of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but let it ever produce an increase of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: and may we all rightly and wisely comprehend the blessings of His Sacred Compassion, so as to see that we owe the more to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in proportion as for our sakes God humbled Himself yet lower.</p>
