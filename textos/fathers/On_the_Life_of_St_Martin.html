<h1>On the Life of St. Martin.</h1>

<h2>Preface to Desiderius.</h2>

<p>Severus to his dearest brother Desiderius sends greeting. I had determined, my like-minded brother, to keep private, and confine within the walls of my own house, the little treatise which I had written concerning the life of St. Martin. I did so, as I am not gifted with much talent, and shrank from the criticisms of the world, lest (as I think will be the case) my somewhat unpolished style should displease my readers, and I should be deemed highly worthy of general reprehension for having too boldly laid hold of a subject which ought to have been reserved for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> eloquent writers. But I have not been able to refuse your request again and again presented. For what could there be which I would not grant in deference to your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, even at the expense of my own modesty? However, I have submitted the work to you on the sure understanding that you will reveal it to no other, having received your promise to that effect. Nevertheless, I have my fears that you will become the means of its publication to the world; and I well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, once issued, it can never  be recalled. If this shall happen, and you come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is read by some others, you will, I trust, kindly ask the readers to attend to the facts related, rather than the language in which they are set forth. You will beg them not to be offended if the style chances unpleasantly to affect their ears, because the kingdom of God consists not of eloquence, but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Let them also bear in mind that <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was preached to the world, not by orators, but by fishermen, although God could certainly have adopted the other course, had it been advantageous. For my part, indeed, when I first applied my mind to writing what follows, because I thought it disgraceful that the excellences of so great a man should remain concealed, I resolved with myself not to feel ashamed on account of solecisms of language. This I did because I had never attained to any great <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of such things; or, if I had formerly some taste of studies of the kind, I had lost the whole of that, through having neglected these matters for so long a course of time. But, after all, that I may not have in future to adopt such an irksome mode of self-defense, the best way will be that the book should be published, if you think right, with the author's name suppressed. In order that this may be done, kindly erase the title which the book bears on its front, so that the page may be silent; and (what is quite enough) let the book proclaim its subject-matter, while it tells nothing of the author.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p class="subh">Reasons for writing the Life of St. Martin.</p>

<p>Most men being vainly devoted to the pursuit of worldly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, have, as they imagined, acquired a memorial of their own names from this source; viz. devoting their pens to the embellishment of the lives of famous men. This course, although it did not secure for them a lasting <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, still has undoubtedly brought them some fulfilment of the hope they cherished. It has done so, both by preserving their own memory, though to no purpose, and because, through their having presented to the world the examples of great men, no small emulation has been excited in the bosoms of their readers. Yet, notwithstanding these things, their labors have in no degree borne upon the blessed and never-ending life to which we look forward. For what has a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, destined to perish with the world, profited those men themselves who have written on mere secular matters? Or what benefit has posterity derived from reading of Hector as a warrior, or Socrates as an expounder of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>? There can be no profit in such things, since it is not only folly to imitate the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> referred to, but absolute <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> not to assail them with the utmost severity. For, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who estimate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life only by present actions, have consigned their hopes to fables, and their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to the tomb. In fact, they gave themselves up to be perpetuated simply in the memory of mortals, whereas it is the duty of man rather to  seek after <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life than an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> memorial and that, not by writing, or fighting, or <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophizing</a>, but by living a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and religious life. This erroneous conduct of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, being enshrined in literature, has prevailed to such an extent that it has found many who have been emulous either of the vain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> or the foolish excellence which has been celebrated. For this reason, I think I will accomplish something well worth the necessary pains, if I write the life of a most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, which shall serve in future as an example to others; by which, indeed, the readers shall be roused to the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and heavenly warfare, and divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. In so doing, we have regard also to our own advantage, so that we may look for, not a vain remembrance among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reward from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, although we ourselves have not lived in such a manner that we can serve for an example to others, nevertheless, we have made it our endeavor that he should not remain unknown who was a man worthy of imitation. I shall therefore set about writing the life of St. Martin, and shall narrate both what he did previous to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, and what he performed as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. At the same time, I cannot hope to set forth all that he was or did. Those excellences of which he alone was conscious are completely unknown, because, as he did not seek for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from men, he desired, as much as he could accomplish it, that his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> should be concealed. And even of those which had become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us, we have omitted a great number, because we have judged it enough if only the more striking and eminent should be recorded. At the same time, I had in the interests of readers to see to it that, no undue amount of instances being set before them should make them weary of the subject. But I implore those who are to read what follows to give full <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the things narrated, and to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that I have written nothing of which I had not certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and evidence. I should, in fact, have preferred to be silent rather than to narrate things which are false. </p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p class="subh">Military Service of St. Martin.</p>

<p>Martin, then, was born at Sabaria  in Pannonia, but was brought up at Ticinum,  which is situated in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were, according to the judgment of the world, of no mean rank, but were <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>. His father was at first simply a soldier, but afterwards a military tribune. He himself in his youth following military pursuits was enrolled in the imperial guard, first under king Constantine, and then under Julian C&aelig;sar. This, however, was not done of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, for, almost from his earliest years, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> infancy of the illustrious boy aspired rather to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  For, when he was of the age of ten years, he betook himself, against the wish of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and begged that he might become a catechumen. Soon afterwards, becoming in a wonderful manner completely devoted to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he was twelve years old, he desired to enter on the life of a hermit; and he would have followed up that desire with the necessary vows, had not his as yet too youthful age prevented. His <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, however, being always engaged on matters pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> or the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, already meditated in his boyish years what he afterwards, as a professed servant of  Christ, fulfilled. But when an edict was issued by the ruling powers  in the state, that the sons of veterans should be enrolled for military service, and he, on the information furnished by his father, (who looked with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> eye on his blessed actions) having been seized and put in chains, when he was fifteen years old, was compelled to take the military <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, then showed himself content with only one servant as his attendant. And even to him, changing places as it were, he often acted as though, while really master, he had been inferior; to such a degree that, for the most part, he drew off his [servant's] boots and cleaned them with his own hand; while they took their meals together, the real master, however, generally acting the part of servant. During nearly three years before his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, he was engaged in the profession of arms, but he kept completely free from those <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> in which that class of men become too frequently involved. He showed exceeding kindness towards his fellow-soldiers, and held them in wonderful affection; while his patience and humility surpassed what seemed possible to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. There is no need to praise the self-denial which he displayed: it was so great that, even at that date, he was regarded not so much as being a soldier as a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. By all these qualities he had so endeared himself to the whole body of his comrades, that they esteemed him while they marvelously loved him. Although not yet made a new creature  in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he, by his good works, acted the part of a candidate for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. This he did, for instance, by aiding those who were in trouble, by furnishing assistance to the wretched, by supporting the needy, by clothing the naked, while he reserved nothing for himself from his military pay except what was necessary for his daily sustenance. Even then, far from being a senseless hearer of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, he so far complied with its precepts as to take no thought about the morrow.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p class="subh">Christ appears to St. Martin.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Accordingly</span>, at a certain period, when he had nothing except his arms and his simple military dress, in the middle of winter, a winter which had shown itself more severe than ordinary, so that the extreme cold was proving fatal to many, he happened to meet at the gate of the city of Amiens  a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man destitute of clothing. He was entreating those that passed by to have compassion upon him, but all passed the wretched man without notice, when Martin, that man full of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, recognized that a being to whom others showed no pity, was, in that respect, left to him. Yet, what should he do? He had nothing except the cloak in which he was clad, for he had already parted with the rest of his garments for similar purposes. Taking, therefore, his sword with which he was girt, he divided his cloak into two equal parts, and gave one part to the poor man, while he again clothed himself with the remainder. Upon this, some of the by-standers laughed, because he was now an unsightly object, and stood out as but partly dressed. Many, however, who were of sounder understanding, groaned deeply because they themselves had done nothing similar. They especially felt this, because, being possessed of more than Martin, they could have clothed the poor man without reducing themselves to nakedness. In the following night, when Martin had resigned himself to sleep, he had a vision of Christ arrayed in that part of his cloak with which he had clothed the poor man. He contemplated the Lord with the greatest attention, and was told to own as his the robe which he had given. Ere long, he heard Jesus saying with a clear voice to the multitude of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> standing round&mdash; <q>Martin, who is still but a catechumen, clothed <span class="stiki" id="note350009"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;25:40</a></span> me with this robe.</q> The Lord, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> mindful of his own words (who had said when on earth&mdash; Inasmuch  as you have done these things to one of the least of these, you have done them unto me), declared that he himself had been clothed in that poor man; and to confirm the testimony he bore to so good a deed, he condescended to show him himself in that very dress which the poor man had received. After this vision the sainted man was not puffed up with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but, acknowledging the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in what had been done, and being now of the age of twenty years, he hastened to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. He did not, however, all at once, retire from military service, yielding to the entreaties of his tribune, whom he admitted to be his familiar tent-companion.  For the tribune promised that, after the period of his office had expired, he too would retire from the world. Martin, kept back by the expectation of this event, continued, although but in name, to act the part of a soldier, for nearly two years after he had received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p class="subh">Martin retires from Military Service.</p>

<p>In the meantime, as the barbarians were rushing within the two divisions of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, Julian C&aelig;sar,  bringing an army together at the city  of the Vaugiones, began to distribute a donative to the soldiers. As was the custom in such a case, they were called forward, one by one, until it came to the turn of Martin. Then, indeed, judging it a suitable opportunity for seeking his discharge&mdash; for he did not think it would be proper for him, if he were not to continue in the service, to receive a donative&mdash; he said to C&aelig;sar, <q>Hitherto I have served <em>you</em> as a soldier: allow me now to become a soldier to God: let the man who is to serve you receive your donative: I am the soldier of Christ: it is not lawful for me to fight.</q> Then <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the tyrant stormed on hearing such words, declaring that, from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the battle, which was to take place on the morrow, and not from any religious feeling, Martin withdrew from the service. But Martin, full of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, yea all the more resolute from the danger that had been set before him, exclaims, <q>If this conduct of mine is ascribed to cowardice, and not to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, I will take my stand unarmed before the line of battle tomorrow, and in the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, protected by the sign of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and not by shield or helmet, I will safely penetrate the ranks of the enemy.</q> He is ordered, therefore, to be thrust back into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, determined on proving his words <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> by exposing himself unarmed to the barbarians. But, on the following day, the enemy sent ambassadors to treat about peace and surrendered both themselves and all their possessions. In these circumstances who can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this victory was due to the saintly man? It was granted him that he should not be sent unarmed to the fight. And although the good Lord could have preserved his own soldier, even amid the swords and darts of the enemy, yet that his blessed eyes might not be pained by witnessing the death of others, he removed all necessity for fighting. For Christ did not require to secure any other victory in behalf of his own soldier, than that, the enemy being subdued without bloodshed, no one should suffer death.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p class="subh">Martin converts a Robber to the Faith.</p>

<p>From that time quitting military service, Martin earnestly sought after the society of Hilarius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city Pictava,  whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the things of God was then regarded as of high renown, and in universal esteem. For some time Martin made his abode with him. Now, this same Hilarius, having instituted him in the office of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>, endeavored still more closely to attach him to himself, and to bind him by leading him to take part in Divine service. But when he constantly refused, crying out that he was unworthy, Hilarius, as being a man of deep penetration, perceived that he could only be constrained in this way, if he should lay that sort of office upon him, in discharging which there should seem to be a kind of injury done him. He therefore appointed him to be an exorcist. Martin did not refuse this appointment, from the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that he might seem to have looked down upon it as somewhat <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>. Not long after this, he was warned in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> that he should visit his native land, and more particularly his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, who were still involved in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>, with a regard for their religious interests. He set forth in accordance with the expressed wish of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Hilarius, and, after being adjured by him with many <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and tears, that he would in due time return. According to report Martin entered on that journey in a melancholy frame of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, after calling the brethren to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that many sufferings lay before him. The result fully justified this prediction. For, first of all, having followed some devious paths among the Alps, he fell into the hands of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>. And when one of them lifted up his axe and poised it above Martin's head, another of them met with his right hand the blow as it fell; nevertheless, having had his hands bound behind his back, he was handed over to one of them to be guarded and stripped. The robber, having led him to a private place apart from the rest, began to enquire of him who he was. Upon this, Martin replied that he was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. The robber next asked him whether he was afraid. Then indeed Martin most courageously replied that he never before had felt so safe, because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the mercy of the Lord would be especially present with him in the midst of trials. He added that he grieved rather for the man in whose hands he was, because, by living a life of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>, he was showing himself unworthy of the mercy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And then entering on a discourse concerning Evangelical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he preached the word of God to the robber. Why should I delay stating the result? The robber <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; and, after expressing his respect for Martin, he restored him to the way, entreating him to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the Lord for him. That same robber was afterwards  seen leading a religious life; so that, in fact, the narrative I have given above is based upon an account furnished by himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p class="subh">The Devil throws himself in the Way of Martin.</p>

<p>Martin, then, having gone on from thence, after he had passed Milan, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> met him in the way, having assumed the form of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> first asked him to what place he was going. Martin having answered him to the effect that he was minded to go wherever the Lord called him, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> said to him, <q>Wherever you go, or whatever you attempt, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> will resist you.</q> Then Martin, replying to him in the prophetical word, said, <q>The Lord is my helper; I will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> what man can do unto me.</q>  Upon this, his enemy immediately vanished out of his sight; and thus, as he had intended in his heart and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, he set free his mother from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>, though his father continued to cleave to its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. However, he saved many by his example.</p>

<p>After this, when the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> had spread through the whole world, and was especially powerful in Illyria, and when he, almost single-handed, was fighting most strenuously against the treachery of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and had been subjected to many punishments (for he was publicly scourged, and at last was compelled to leave the city), again betaking himself to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and having found the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the two divisions of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> in a distracted condition through the departure also of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Hilarius, whom the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> had driven into exile, he established a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for himself at Milan. There, too, Auxentius, the originator and leader of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, bitterly <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> him; and, after he had assailed him with many injuries, violently expelled him from the city. Thinking, therefore, that it was necessary to yield to circumstances, he withdrew to the island Gallinaria,  with a certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> as his companion, a man of distinguished excellences. Here he subsisted for some time on the roots of plants; and, while doing so, he took for food hellebore, which is, as people say, a poisonous kind of grass. But when he perceived the strength of the poison increasing within him, and death now nearly at hand, he warded off the imminent danger by means of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and immediately all his pains were put to flight. And not long after having discovered that, through penitence on the part of the king, permission to return had been granted to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Hilarius, he made an effort to meet him at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and, with this view, set out for that city.</p>

<p class="subh">Martin restores a Catechumen to Life.</p>

<p>As Hilarius had already gone away, so Martin followed in his footsteps; and having been most joyously welcomed by him, he established for himself a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> not far from the town. At this time a certain catechumen joined him, being desirous of becoming instructed in the doctrines  and habits of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man. But, after the lapse only of a few days, the catechumen, seized with a languor, began to suffer from a violent fever. It so happened that Martin had then left home, and having remained away three days, he found on his return that life had departed from the catechumen; and so suddenly had death occurred, that he had left this world without receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The body being laid out in public was being <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by the last sad offices on the part of the mourning brethren, when Martin hurries up to them with tears and lamentations. But then laying hold, as it were, of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, with the whole powers of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, he orders the others to quit the cell in which the body was lying; and bolting the door, he stretches himself at full length on the dead limbs of the departed brother. Having given himself for some time to earnest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and perceiving by means of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> that power was present,  he then rose up for a little, and gazing on the countenance of the deceased, he waited without misgiving for the result of his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and of the mercy of the Lord. And scarcely had the space of two hours elapsed, when he saw the dead man begin to move a little in all his members, and to tremble with his eyes opened for the practice of sight. Then indeed, turning to the Lord with a loud voice and giving thanks, he filled the cell with his ejaculations. Hearing the noise, those who had been standing at the door immediately rush inside. And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a marvelous spectacle met them, for they beheld the man alive whom they had formerly left dead. Thus being restored to life, and having immediately obtained <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, he lived for many years afterwards; and he was the first who offered himself to us both as a subject that had experienced the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>  of Martin, and as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. The same man was wont to relate that, when he left the body, he was brought before the tribunal of the Judge, and being assigned to gloomy regions and vulgar crowds, he  received a severe  sentence. Then, however, he added, it was suggested by two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the Judge that he was the man for whom Martin was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>; and that, on this account, he was ordered to be led back by the same <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and given up to Martin, and restored to his former life. From this time forward, the name of the sainted man became illustrious, so that, as being reckoned <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> by all, he was also deemed powerful and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p class="subh">Martin restores one that had been strangled.</p>

<p>Not long after these events, while Martin was passing by the estate of a certain man named Lupicinus, who was held in high esteem according to the judgment of the world, he was received with shouting and the lamentations of a wailing crowd. Having, in an anxious state of mind gone up to that multitude, and enquired what such weeping meant, he was told that one of the slaves of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> had put an end to his life by hanging. Hearing this, Martin entered the cell in which the body was lying, and, excluding all the multitude, he stretched himself upon the body, and spent some little time in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Ere long, the deceased, with life beaming in his countenance, and with his drooping eyes fixed on Martin's face, is aroused; and with a gentle effort attempting to rise, he laid hold of the right hand of the saintly man, and by this means stood upon his feet. In this manner, while the whole multitude looked on, he walked along with Martin to the porch of the house.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p class="subh">High Esteem in which Martin was held.</p>

<p>Nearly about the same time, Martin was called upon to undertake the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of the church at Tours;  but when he could not easily be drawn forth from his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, a certain Ruricius, one of the citizens, pretending that his wife was ill, and casting himself down at his knees, prevailed on him to go forth. Multitudes of the citizens having previously been posted by the road on which he traveled, he is thus under a kind of guard escorted to the city. An incredible number of people not only from that town, but also from the neighboring cities, had, in a wonderful manner, assembled to give their votes.  There was but one wish among all, there were the same <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and there was the same fixed opinion to the effect that Martin was most worthy of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, and that the church would be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> with such a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. A few <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, however, and among these some of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who had been summoned to appoint a chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, were impiously offering resistance, asserting forsooth that Martin's person was contemptible, that he was unworthy of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, that he was a man despicable in countenance, that his clothing was mean, and his hair disgusting. This <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of theirs was ridiculed by the people of sounder judgment, inasmuch as such objectors only proclaimed the illustrious character of the man, while they sought to <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> him. Nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> was it allowed them to do anything else, than what the people, following the Divine will, desired  to be accomplished. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, however, who had been present, a certain one of the name Defensor is said to have specially offered opposition; and on this account it was observed that he was at the time severely censured in the reading from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For when it so happened that the reader, whose duty it was to read in public that day, being blocked out by the people, failed to appear, the officials falling into confusion, while they waited for him who never came, one of those standing by, laying hold of the Psalter, seized upon the first verse which presented itself to him. Now, the Psalm ran thus: <q>Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have perfected praise because of your enemies, that you might destroy the enemy and the avenger.</q>  On these words being read, a shout was raised by the people, and the opposite party were confounded. It was <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that this Psalm had been chosen by Divine ordination, that Defensor  might hear a testimony to his own work, because the praise of the Lord was perfected out of the mouth of babes and sucklings in the case of Martin, while the enemy was at the same time both pointed out and destroyed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p class="subh">Martin as Bishop of Tours.</p>

<p>And now having entered on the episcopal office, it is beyond my power fully to set forth how Martin distinguished himself in the discharge of its duties. For he remained with the utmost constancy, the same as he had been  before. There was the same humility in his heart, and the same homeliness in his garments. Full alike of dignity and courtesy, he kept up the position of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> properly, yet in such a way as not to lay aside the objects and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. Accordingly he made use, for some time, of the cell connected with the church; but afterwards, when he felt it impossible to tolerate the disturbance caused by the numbers of those visiting it, he established a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for himself about two miles outside the city. This spot was so secret and retired that he enjoyed in it the solitude of a hermit. For, on one side, it was surrounded by a precipitous rock of a lofty mountain, while the river Loire had shut in the rest of the plain by a bay extending back for a little distance; and the place could be approached only by one, and that a very narrow passage. Here, then, he possessed a cell constructed of wood. Many also of the brethren had, in the same manner, fashioned retreats for themselves, but most of them had formed these out of the rock of the overhanging mountain, hollowed into caves. There were altogether eighty <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who were being disciplined after the example of the saintly master. No one there had anything which was called his own; all things were possessed in common. It was not allowed either to buy or to sell anything, as is the custom among most <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. No art was practiced there, except that of transcribers, and even this was assigned to the brethren of younger years, while the elders spent their time in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Rarely did any one of them go beyond the cell, unless when they assembled at the place of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. They all took their food together, after the hour of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> was past. No one used wine, except when illness compelled them to do so. Most of them were clothed in garments of camels' hair. <span class="stiki" id="note350026"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;3:4</a></span> Any dress approaching to softness  was there deemed criminal, and this must be thought the more remarkable, because many among them were such as are deemed of noble rank. These, though far differently brought up, had forced themselves down to this degree of humility and patient endurance, and we have seen numbers of these afterwards made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. For what city or church would there be that would not desire to have its <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from among those in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Martin?</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p class="subh">Martin demolishes an Altar <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to a Robber.</p>

<p>But let me proceed to a description of other excellences which Martin displayed as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. There was, not far from the town, a place very close to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which a false <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> opinion had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, on the supposition that some <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> had been buried together there. For it was also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that an altar had been placed there by former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. But Martin, not inclined to give a hasty belief to things uncertain, often asked from those who were his elders, whether among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, that the name of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, or the time when he suffered, should be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him. He did so, he said, because he had great scruples on these points, inasmuch as no steady tradition respecting them had come down from antiquity. Having, therefore, for a time kept away from the place, by no means wishing to lessen the religious veneration with which it was regarded, because he was as yet uncertain, but, at the same time not lending his authority to the opinion of the multitude, lest a mere <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> should obtain a firmer footing, he one day went out to the place, taking a few brethren with him as companions. There standing above the very sepulchre, Martin <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the Lord that he would reveal, who the man in question was, and what was his character or desert. Next turning to the left-hand side, he sees standing very near a shade of a mean and cruel appearance. Martin commands him to tell his name and character. Upon this, he declares his name, and confesses his guilt. He says that he had been a robber, and that he was beheaded on account of his crimes; that he had been <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> simply by an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the multitude; that he had nothing in common with the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, since <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was their portion, while punishment exacted its penalties from him. Those who stood by heard, in a wonderful way, the voice of the speaker, but they beheld no person. Then Martin made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what he had seen, and ordered the altar which had been there to be removed, and thus he delivered the people from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of that <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p class="subh">Martin causes the Bearers of a Dead Body to stop.</p>

<p>Now, it came to pass some time after the above, that while Martin was going a journey, he met the body of a certain <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, which was being carried to the tomb with superstitious funeral <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. Perceiving from a distance the crowd that was approaching, and being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> as to what was going on, he stood still for a little while. For there was a distance of nearly half a mile between him and the crowd, so that it was difficult to discover what the spectacle he beheld really was. Nevertheless, because he saw it was a rustic gathering, and when the linen clothes spread over the body were blown about by the action of the wind, he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that some profane <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> were being performed. This thought occurred to him, because it was the custom of the Gallic rustics in their wretched folly to carry about through the fields the images of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> veiled with a white covering. Lifting up, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> opposite to them, he commanded the crowd not to move from the place in which they were, and to set down the burden. Upon this, the miserable creatures might have been seen at first to become stiff like rocks. Next, as they endeavored, with every possible effort, to move forward, but were not able to take a step farther, they began to whirl themselves about in the most ridiculous fashion, until, not able any longer to sustain the weight, they set down the dead body. Thunderstruck, and gazing in bewilderment at each other as not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what had happened to them they remained sunk in silent thought. But when the saintly man discovered that they were simply a band of peasants celebrating funeral <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, and not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to the gods, again raising his hand, he gave them the power of going away, and of lifting up the body. Thus he both compelled them to stand when he pleased, and permitted them to depart when he thought good.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p class="subh">Martin escapes from a Falling Pine-tree.</p>

<p>Again, when in a certain village he had demolished a very ancient temple, and had set about cutting down a pine-tree, which stood close to the temple, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of that place, and a crowd of other <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> began to oppose him. And these people, though, under the influence of the Lord, they had been quiet while the temple was being overthrown, could not patiently allow the tree to be cut down. Martin carefully instructed them that there was nothing sacred in the trunk of a tree, and urged them rather to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> God whom he himself served. He added that there was a moral necessity why that tree should be cut down, because it had been dedicated to a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>. Then one of them who was bolder than the others says, <q>If you have any trust in your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom you say you worship, we ourselves will cut down this tree, and be it your part to receive it when falling; for if, as you declare, your Lord is with you, you will escape all injury.</q> Then Martin, courageously trusting in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, promises that he would do what had been asked. Upon this, all that crowd of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> agreed to the condition named; for they held the loss of their tree a small matter, if only they got the enemy of their religion buried beneath its fall. Accordingly, since that pine-tree was hanging over in one direction, so that there was no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to what side it would fall on being cut, Martin, having been bound, is, in accordance with the decision of these <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, placed in that spot where, as no one <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>, the tree was about to fall. They began, therefore, to cut down their own tree, with great glee and joyfulness, while there was at some distance a great multitude of wondering spectators. And now the pine-tree began to totter, and to threaten its  own ruin by falling. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at a distance grew pale, and, terrified by the danger ever coming nearer, had lost all hope and confidence, expecting only the death of Martin. But he, trusting in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and waiting courageously, when now the falling pine had uttered its expiring crash, while it was now falling, while it was just rushing upon him, simply holding up his hand against it, he put in its way the sign of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Then, indeed, after the manner of a spinning-top (one might have thought it driven  back), it swept round to the opposite side, to such a degree that it almost crushed the rustics, who had taken their places there in what was deemed a safe spot. Then <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, a shout being raised to heaven, the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> were amazed by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> wept for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; and the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in common extolled by all. The well-known result was that on that day <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> came to that region. For there was hardly one of that immense multitude of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> who did not express a desire for the imposition of hands, and abandoning his impious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, made a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>. Certainly, before the times of Martin, very few, nay, almost none, in those regions had received the name of Christ; but through his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and example that name has prevailed to such an extent, that now there is no place thereabouts which is not filled either with very crowded churches or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. For wherever he destroyed <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> temples, there he used immediately to build either churches or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p class="subh">Martin destroys Heathen Temples and Altars.</p>

<p>Nor did he show less eminence, much about the same time, in other transactions of a like kind. For, having in a certain village set fire to a very ancient and celebrated temple, the circle of flames was carried by the action of the wind upon a house which was very close to, yea, connected with, the temple. When Martin perceived this, he climbed by rapid ascent to the roof of the house, presenting himself in front of the advancing flames. Then indeed might the fire have been seen thrust back in a wonderful manner against the force of the wind, so that there appeared a sort of conflict of the two elements fighting together. Thus, by the influence of Martin, the fire only acted in the place where it was ordered to do so. But in a village which was named Leprosum, when he too wished to overthrow a temple which had acquired great <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> through the superstitious ideas entertained of its <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, a multitude of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> resisted him to such a degree that he was driven back not without bodily injury. He, therefore, withdrew to a place in the vicinity, and there for three days, clothed in sackcloth  and ashes <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> the whole time, he besought the Lord, that, as he had not been able to overthrow that temple by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> effort, Divine power might be exerted to destroy it. Then two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, with spears and shields after the manner of heavenly warriors, suddenly presented themselves to him, saying that they were sent by the Lord to put to flight the rustic multitude, and to furnish protection to Martin, lest, while the temple was being destroyed, any one should offer resistance. They told him therefore to return, and complete the blessed work which he had begun. Accordingly Martin returned to the village; and while the crowds of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> looked on in perfect quiet as he razed the pagan temple even to the foundations, he also reduced all the altars and images to dust. At this sight the rustics, when they perceived that they had been so astounded and terrified by an intervention of the Divine will, that they might not be found fighting against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, almost all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>. They then began to cry out openly and to confess that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Martin ought to be worshipped, and that the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> should be despised, which were not able to help them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p class="subh">Martin offers his Neck to an Assassin.</p>

<p>I shall also relate what took place in the village of the &AElig;dui. When Martin was there overthrowing a temple, a multitude of rustic <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> rushed upon him in a frenzy of rage. And when one of them, bolder than the rest, made an attack upon him with a drawn sword, Martin, throwing back his cloak, offered his bare neck to the assassin. Nor did the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> delay to strike, but in the very act of lifting up his right arm, he fell to the ground on his back, and being overwhelmed by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he entreated for pardon. Not unlike this was that other event which happened to Martin, that when a certain man had resolved to wound him with a knife as he was destroying some <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, at the very moment of fetching the blow, the weapon was struck out of his hands and disappeared. Very frequently, too, when the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> were addressing him to the effect that he would not overthrow their temples, he so soothed and conciliated the minds of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> by his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> discourse that, the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> having been revealed to them, they themselves overthrew their own temples.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p class="subh">Cures effected by St. Martin.</p>

<p>Moreover, the gift  of accomplishing cures was so largely possessed by Martin, that scarcely any sick person came to him for assistance without being at once restored to health. This will clearly appear from the following example. A certain girl at Treves  was so completely prostrated by a terrible paralysis that for a long time she had been quite unable to make use of her body for any purpose, and being, as it were, already dead, only the smallest breath of life seemed still to remain in her. Her afflicted <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> were standing by, expecting nothing but her death, when it was suddenly announced that Martin had come to that city. When the father of the girl found that such was the case, he ran to make a request in behalf of his all but lifeless child. It happened that Martin had already entered the church. There, while the people were looking on, and in the presence of many other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the old man, uttering a cry of grief, embraced the saint's knees and said: <q>My daughter is dying of a miserable kind of infirmity; and, what is more dreadful than death itself, she is now alive only in the spirit, her flesh being already dead before the time. I beseech you to go to her, and give her your blessing; for I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that through you she will be restored to health.</q> Martin, troubled by such an address, was bewildered, and shrank back, saying that this was a matter not in his own hands; that the old man was mistaken in the judgment he had formed; and that he was not worthy to be the instrument through whom the Lord should make a display of his power. The father, in tears, persevered in still more earnestly pressing the case, and entreated Martin to visit the dying girl. At last, constrained by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> standing by to go as requested, he went down to the home of the girl. An immense crowd was waiting at the doors, to see what the servant of the Lord would do. And first, betaking himself to his familiar arms in affairs of that kind, he cast himself down on the ground and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>. Then gazing earnestly upon the ailing girl, he requests that oil should be given him. After he had received and blessed this, he poured the powerful sacred liquid into the mouth of the girl, and immediately her voice returned to her. Then gradually, through contact with him, her limbs began, one by one, to recover life, till, at last, in the presence of the people, she arose with firm steps.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p class="subh">Martin casts out Several Devils.</p>

<p>At the same time the servant of one Tetradius, a man of proconsular rank, having been laid hold of by a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, was tormented with the most miserable results. Martin, therefore, having been asked to lay his hands on him, ordered the servant to be brought to him; but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit could, in no way, be brought forth from the cell in which he was: he showed himself so fearful, with ferocious teeth, to those who attempted to draw near. Then Tetradius throws himself at the feet of the saintly man, imploring that he himself would go down to the house in which the possessed of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was kept. But Martin then declared that he could not visit the house of an unconverted <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. For Tetradius, at that time, was still involved in the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>. He, therefore, pledges his word that if the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> were driven out of the boy, he would become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Martin, then, laying his hand upon the boy, cast the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit out of him. On seeing this, Tetradius <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, and immediately became a catechumen, while, not long after, he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and he always regarded Martin with extraordinary affection, as having been the author of his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>About the same time, having entered the dwelling of a certain householder in the same town, he stopped short at the very threshold, and said, that he perceived a horrible <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> in the courtyard of the house. When Martin ordered it to depart, it laid hold of a certain member of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, who was staying in the inner part of the house; and the poor wretch began at once to rage with his teeth, and to lacerate whomsoever he met. The house was thrown into disorder; the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was in confusion; and the people present took to flight. Martin threw himself in the way of the frenzied creature, and first of all commanded him to stand still. But when he continued to gnash with his teeth, and, with gaping mouth, was threatening to bite, Martin inserted his fingers into his mouth, and said, <q>If you possess any power, devour these.</q> But then, as if red-hot iron had entered his jaws, drawing his teeth far away he took care not to touch the fingers of the saintly man; and when he was compelled by punishments and tortures, to flee out of the possessed body, while he had no power of escaping by the mouth, he was cast out by means of a defluxion of the belly, leaving disgusting traces behind him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p class="subh">Martin performs Various Miracles.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, as a sudden report had troubled the city as to the movement and inroad of the barbarians, Martin orders a possessed person to be set before him, and commanded him to declare whether this message was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or not. Then he confessed that there were sixteen <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who had spread this report among the people, in order that by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> thus excited, Martin might have to flee from the city, but that, in fact, nothing was less in the minds of the barbarians than to make any inroad. When the unclean spirit thus acknowledged these things in the midst of the church, the city was set free from the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and tumult which had at the time been felt.</p>

<p>At Paris, again, when Martin was entering the gate of the city, with large crowds attending him, he gave a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> to a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, of miserable appearance, while all shuddered at seeing him do so; and Martin blessed him, with the result that he was instantly cleansed from all his misery. On the following day, the man appearing in the church with a healthy skin, gave thanks for the soundness of body which he had recovered. This fact, too, ought not to be passed over in silence, that threads from Martin's garment, or such as had been plucked from the sackcloth which he wore, wrought frequent <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> upon those who were sick. For, by either being tied round the fingers or placed about the neck, they very often drove away diseases from the afflicted.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19</h2>

<p class="subh">A Letter of Martin effects a Cure, with Other Miracles.</p>

<p>Further, Arborius, an ex-prefect, and a man of a very <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and faithful character, while his daughter was in agony from the burning fever of a quartan ague, inserted in the bosom of the girl, at the very paroxysm of the heat, a letter of Martin which happened to have been brought to him, and immediately the fever was dispelled. This event had such an influence upon Arborius, that he at once <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the girl to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and devoted her to perpetual <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Then, proceeding to Martin, he presented the girl to him, as an obvious living example of his power of working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, inasmuch as she had been cured by him though absent; and he would not suffer her to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by any other than Martin, through his placing upon her the dress characteristic of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.</p>

<p>Paulinus, too, a man who was afterwards to furnish a striking example of the age, having begun to suffer grievously in one of his eyes, and when a pretty thick skin  having grown over it had already covered up its pupil, Martin touched his eye with a painter's brush, and, all pain being removed, thus restored it to its former soundness. He himself also, when, by a certain accident, he had fallen out of an upper room, and tumbling down a broken, uneven stair, had received many wounds, as he lay in his cell at the point of death, and was tortured with grievous sufferings, saw in the night an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> appear to him, who washed his wounds, and applied healing ointment to the bruised members of his body. As the effect of this, he found himself on the morrow restored to soundness of health, so that he was not thought to have suffered any harm. But because it would be tedious to go through everything of this kind, let these examples suffice, as a few out of a multitude; and let it be enough that we do not in striking cases [of miraculous interposition] detract from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, while, having so many to choose from, we avoid exciting weariness in the reader.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p class="subh">How Martin acted towards the Emperor Maximus.</p>

<p>And here to insert some smaller matters among things so great (although such is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of our times in which all things have fallen into decay and corruption, it is almost a pre-eminent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> firmness not to have yielded to royal flattery), when a number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from various parts had assembled to the Emperor Maximus, a man of fierce character, and at that time elated with the victory he had won in the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and when the disgraceful flattery of all around the emperor was generally remarked, while the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dignity had, with degenerate submissiveness, taken a second place to the royal retinue, in Martin alone, apostolic authority continued to assert itself. For even if he had to make suit to the sovereign for some things, he commanded rather than entreated him; and although often invited, he kept away from his entertainments, saying that he could not take a place at the table of one who, out of two emperors, had deprived one of his kingdom, and the other of his life. At last, when Maximus maintained that he had not of his own accord assumed the sovereignty, but that he had simply defended by arms the necessary requirements  of the empire, regard to which had been imposed upon him by the soldiers, according to the Divine appointment, and that the favor of God did not seem wanting to him who, by an event seemingly so incredible, had secured the victory, adding to that the statement that none of his adversaries had been slain except in the open field of battle, at length, Martin, overcome either by his reasoning or his entreaties, came to the royal banquet. The king was wonderfully pleased because he had gained this point. Moreover, there were guests present who had been invited as if to a festival; men of the highest and most illustrious rank&mdash;the prefect, who was also consul, named Evodius, one of the most righteous men that ever lived; two courtiers possessed of the greatest power, the brother and uncle of the king, while between these two, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of Martin had taken his place; but he himself occupied a seat which was set quite close to the king. About the middle of the banquet, according to custom, one of the servants presented a goblet to the king. He orders it rather to be given to the very <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, expecting and hoping that he should then receive the cup from his right hand. But Martin, when he had drunk, handed the goblet to his own <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, as thinking no one worthier to drink next to himself, and holding that it would not be right for him to prefer either the king himself, or those who were next the king, to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. And the emperor, as well as all those who were then present, admired this conduct so much, that this very thing, by which they had been undervalued, gave them pleasure. The report then ran through the whole palace that Martin had done, at the king's dinner, what no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had dared to do at the banquets of the lowest judges. And Martin predicted to the same Maximus long before, that if he went into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to which he then desired to go, waging <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, against the Emperor Valentinianus, it would come to pass that he should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> he would  indeed be victorious in the first attack, but would perish a short time afterwards. And we have seen that this did in fact take place. For, on his first arrival Valentinianus had to betake himself to flight but recovering his strength about a year afterwards, Maximus was taken and slain by him within the walls of Aquileia.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<p class="subh">Martin has to do both with Angels and Devils.</p>

<p>It is also well known that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were very often seen by him, so that they spoke in turns with him in set speech. As to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, Martin held him so visible and ever under the power of his eyes, that whether he kept himself in his proper form, or changed himself into different shapes of spiritual <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, he was perceived by Martin, under whatever guise he appeared. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> well that he could not escape discovery, and therefore frequently heaped insults upon Martin, being unable to beguile him by trickery. On one occasion the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, holding in his hand the bloody horn of an ox, rushed into Martin's cell with great noise, and holding out to him his bloody right hand, while at the same time he exulted in the crime he had committed, said: <q>Where, O Martin, is your power? I have just slain one of your people.</q> Then Martin assembled the brethren, and related to them what the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> had disclosed, while he ordered them carefully to search the several cells in order to discover who had been visited with this calamity. They report that no one of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> was missing, but that one peasant, hired by them, had gone to the forest to bring home wood in his wagon. Upon hearing this, Martin instructs some of them to go and meet him. On their doing so, the man was found almost dead at no great distance from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Nevertheless, although just drawing his last breath, he made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the brethren the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his wound and death. He said that, while he was drawing tighter the thongs which had got loose on the oxen yoked together, one of the oxen, throwing his head free, had wounded him with his horn in the groin. And not long after the man expired. You  see with what judgment of the Lord this power was given to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. This was a marvelous feature in Martin that not only on this occasion to which I have specially referred, but on many occasions of the same kind, in fact as often as such things occurred, he perceived them long beforehand, and  disclosed the things which had been revealed to him to the brethren.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>

<p class="subh">Martin preaches Repentance even to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a>.</p>

<p>Now, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, while he tried to impose upon the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man by a thousand injurious arts, often thrust himself upon him in a visible form, but in very various shapes. For sometimes he presented himself to his view changed into the person of Jupiter, often into that of Mercury and Minerva. Often, too, were heard words of reproach, in which the crowd of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> assailed Martin with scurrilous expressions. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that all were false and groundless, he was not affected by the charges brought against him. Moreover, some of the brethren bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that they had heard a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> reproaching Martin in abusive terms, and asking why he had taken back, on their subsequent repentance, certain of the brethren who had, some time previously, lost their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by falling into various <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> set forth the crimes of each of them; but they added that Martin, resisting the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> firmly, answered him, that by-past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are cleansed away by the leading of a better life, and that through the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, those are to be absolved from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> who have given up their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> saying in opposition to this that such guilty men as those referred to did not come within the pale of pardon, and that no mercy was extended by the Lord to those who had once fallen away, Martin is said to have cried out in words to the following effect: <q>If you, yourself, wretched being, would but desist from attacking <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and even, at this period, when the day of judgment is at hand, would only repent of your <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, I, with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> confidence in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, would promise you the mercy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q>  O what a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> boldness with respect to the loving-kindness of the Lord, in which, although he could not assert authority, he nevertheless showed the feelings dwelling within him! And since our discourse has here sprung up concerning the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his devices, it does not seem away from the point, although the matter does not bear immediately upon Martin, to relate what took place; both because the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of Martin do, to some extent, appear in the transaction, and the incident, which was worthy of a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, will properly be put on record, with the view of furnishing a caution, should anything of a similar character subsequently occur.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23</h2>

<p class="subh">A Case of Diabolic Deception.</p>

<p>There was a certain man, Clarus by name, a most noble youth, who afterwards became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and who is now, through his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> departure from this world, numbered among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. He, leaving all others, betook himself to Martin, and in a short time became distinguished for the most exalted <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and for all sorts of excellence. Now, it came to pass that, when he had erected an abode for himself not far from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and many brethren were staying with him, a certain youth, Anatolius by name, having, under the profession of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> assumed every appearance of humility and innocence, came to him, and lived for some time on the common store along with the rest. Then, as time went on, he began to affirm that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of talking with him. As no one gave any credit to his words, he urged a number of the brethren to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> by certain signs. At length he went to such a length as to declare that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> passed between him and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and now he wished that he should be regarded as one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Clarus, however, could by no means be induced to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. He then began to threaten Clarus with the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and present afflictions, because he did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> one of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. At the last, he is related to have burst forth with the following declaration: <q>Behold, the Lord will this night give me a white robe out of heaven, clothed in which, I will dwell in the midst of you; and that will be to you a sign that I am the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as I have been presented with the garment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Then <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the expectation of all was highly raised by this profession. Accordingly, about the middle of the night, it was seen, by the noise of people moving eagerly about, that the whole <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the place was excited. It might be seen, too, that the cell in which the young man referred to lived was glittering with numerous lights; and the whisperings of those moving about in it, as well as a kind of murmur of many voices, could be heard. Then, on silence being secured, the youth coming forth calls one of the brethren, Sabatius by name, to himself, and shows him the robe in which he had been clothed. He again, filled with amazement, gathers the rest together, and Clarus himself also runs up; and a light being obtained, they all carefully inspect the garment. Now, it was of the utmost softness, of marvelous brightness, and of glittering purple, and yet no one could discover what was its nature, or of what sort of fleece it had been formed. However, when it was more minutely examined by the eyes or fingers, it seemed nothing else than a garment. In the meantime, Clarus urges upon the brethren to be earnest in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that the Lord would show them more clearly what it really was. Accordingly, the rest of the night was spent in singing <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and psalms. But when day broke, Clarus wished to take the young man by the hand, and bring him to Martin, being well aware that he could not be deceived by any arts of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Then, indeed, the miserable man began to resist and refuse, and affirmed that he had been forbidden to show himself to Martin. And when they compelled him to go against his will, the garment vanished from among the hands of those who were conducting him. Wherefore, who can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this, too, was an illustration of the power of Martin, so that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> could no longer dissemble or conceal his own deception, when it was to be submitted to the eyes of Martin?</p>

<h2>Chapter 24</h2>

<p class="subh">Martin is tempted by the Wiles of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a>.</p>

<p>It was found, again, that about the same time there was a young man in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, who, having by many signs obtained for himself authority among the people, was puffed up to such a pitch that he gave himself out as being Elias. And when multitudes had too readily <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> this, he went on to say that he was actually Christ; and he succeeded so well even in this delusion that a certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> named Rufus worshipped him as being the Lord. For so doing, we have seen this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at a later date deprived of his office. Many of the brethren have also informed me that at the same time one arose in the East, who boasted that he was John. We may infer from this, since <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> of such a kind have appeared, that the coming of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> is at hand; for he is already practicing in these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of iniquity. And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> I think this point should not be passed over, with what arts the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> about this very time tempted Martin. For, on a certain day, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>  having been previously offered, and the fiend himself being surrounded by a purple light, in order that he might the more easily deceive people by the brilliance of the splendor assumed, clothed also in a royal robe, and with a crown of precious stones and gold encircling his head, his shoes too being inlaid with gold, while he presented a tranquil countenance, and a generally rejoicing aspect, so that no such thought as that he was the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> might be entertained&mdash; he stood by the side of Martin as he was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in his cell. The saint being dazzled by his first appearance, both preserved a long and deep silence. This was first broken by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who said: <q>Acknowledge, Martin, who it is that you behold. I am Christ; and being just about to descend to earth, I wished first to manifest myself to you.</q> When Martin kept silence on hearing these words, and gave no answer whatever, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> dared to repeat his audacious declaration: <q>Martin, why do you hesitate to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, when you see? I am Christ.</q> Then Martin, the Spirit revealing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to him, that he might understand it was the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, replied as follows: <q>The Lord Jesus did not predict that he would come clothed in purple, and with a glittering crown upon his head. I will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Christ has come, unless he appears with that appearance and form in which he suffered, and openly displaying the marks of his wounds upon the cross.</q> On hearing these words, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> vanished like smoke, and filled the cell with such a disgusting smell, that he left unmistakable evidences of his real character. This event, as I have just related, took place in the way which I have stated, and my information regarding it was derived from the lips of Martin himself; therefore let no one regard it as fabulous. </p>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>

<p class="subh">Intercourse of Sulpitius with Martin.</p>

<p>For since I, having long heard accounts of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, life and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, burned with a desire of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> him, I undertook what was to me a pleasant journey for the purpose of seeing him. At the same time, because already my mind was inflamed with the desire of writing his life, I obtained my information partly from himself, in so far as I could venture to question him, and partly from those who had lived with him, or well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the facts of the case. And at this time it is scarcely credible with what humility and with what kindness he received me; while he cordially wished me <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and rejoiced in the Lord that he had been held in such high estimation by me that I had undertaken a journey owing to my desire of seeing him. Unworthy me! (in fact, I hardly dare acknowledge it), that he should have deigned to admit me to fellowship with him! He went so far as in person to present me with water to wash my hands, and at eventide he himself washed my feet; nor had I sufficient <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to resist or oppose his doing so. In fact, I felt so overcome by the authority he unconsciously exerted, that I deemed it unlawful to do anything but acquiesce in his arrangements. His conversation with me was all directed to such points as the following: that the allurements of this world and secular burdens were to be abandoned in order that we might be free and unencumbered in following the Lord Jesus; and he pressed upon me as an admirable example in present circumstances the conduct of that distinguished man Paulinus, of whom I have made mention above. Martin declared of him that, by parting with his great possessions and following Christ, as he did, he showed himself almost the only one who in these times had fully <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. He insisted strongly that that was the man who should be made the object of our imitation, adding that the present age was fortunate in possessing such a model of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For Paulinus, being rich and having many possessions, by selling them all and giving them to the poor according to the expressed will of the Lord, had, he said, made possible by actual <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> what appeared impossible of accomplishment. What power and dignity there were in Martin's words and conversation! How active he was, how practical, and how prompt and ready in solving questions connected with Scripture! And because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that many are incredulous on this point&mdash;for indeed I have met with <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me when I related such things&mdash;I call to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> Jesus, and our common hope as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, that I never heard from any other lips than those of Martin such exhibitions of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and genius, or such specimens of good and pure speech. But yet, how insignificant is all such praise when compared with the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which he possessed! Still, it is remarkable that in a man who had no claim to be called learned, even this attribute [of high intelligence] was not wanting.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>

<p class="subh">Words cannot describe the Excellences of Martin.</p>

<p>But now my book must be brought to an end, and my discourse finished. This is not because all that was worthy of being said concerning Martin is now exhausted, but because I, just as sluggish poets grow less careful towards the end of their work, give over, being baffled by the immensity of the matter. For, although his outward <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> could in some sort of way be set forth in words, no language, I <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> own, can ever be capable of describing his inner life and daily conduct, and his mind always bent upon the things of heaven. No one can adequately make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> his perseverance and self-mastery in abstinence and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, or his power in watchings and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, along with the nights, as well as days, which were spent by him, while not a moment was separated from the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either for indulging in ease, or engaging in business. But, in fact, he did not indulge either in food or sleep, except in so far as the necessities of nature required. I freely confess that, if, as the saying is, Homer himself were to ascend from the shades below, he could not do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to this subject in words; to such an extent did all excellences surpass in Martin the possibility of being embodied in language. Never did a single hour or moment pass in which he was not either actually engaged in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; or, if it happened that he was occupied with something else, still he never let his mind loose from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, just as it is the custom of blacksmiths, in the midst of their work to beat their own anvil as a sort of relief to the laborer, so Martin even when he appeared to be doing something else, was still engaged in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. O <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> blessed man in whom there was no guile&mdash; judging no man, condemning no man, returning <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to no man! He displayed indeed such marvelous patience in the endurance of injuries, that even when he was chief  <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he allowed himself to be wronged by the lowest <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> with impunity; nor did he either remove them from the office on account of such conduct, or, as far as in him lay, repel them from a place in his affection.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27</h2>

<p class="subh">Wonderful Piety of Martin.</p>

<p>No one ever saw him enraged, or excited, or lamenting, or laughing; he was always one and the same: displaying a kind of heavenly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in his countenance, he seemed to have passed the ordinary limits of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Never was there any word on his lips but Christ, and never was there a feeling in his heart except <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, peace, and tender mercy. Frequently, too, he used to weep for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those who showed themselves his revilers&mdash; those who, as he led his retired and tranquil life, <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> him with poisoned tongue and a viper's mouth. And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> we have had experience of some who were <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and his life&mdash; who really <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> in him what they did not see in themselves, and what they had not power to imitate. And&mdash; O <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> worthy of deepest grief and groans!&mdash; some of his <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a>, although very few, some of his maligners, I say, were reported to be no others than <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>! Here, however, it is not necessary to name any one, although a good many of these people are still venting  their spleen against myself. I shall deem it sufficient that, if any one of them reads this account, and perceives that he is himself pointed at, he may have the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to blush. But if, on the other hand, he shows <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, he will, by that very fact, own that he is among those spoken of, though all the time perhaps I have been thinking of some other person. I shall, however, by no means feel ashamed if any people of that sort include myself in their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> along with such a man as Martin. I am quite persuaded of this, that the present little work will give pleasure to all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> good men. And I shall only say further that, if any one read this narrative in an unbelieving spirit, he himself will fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. I am conscious to myself that I have been induced by belief in the facts, and by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to write these things; and that, in doing so, I have set forth what is well known, and recorded what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and, as I trust, that man will have a reward prepared by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not who shall read these things, but who shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them. </p>
