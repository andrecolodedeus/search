<h1>On the Predestination of the Saints (Book I)</h1>

<p><strong>Addressed to Prosper and Hilary.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Wherein the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is defended against the semi-<a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>&mdash;those people to wit, who by no means withdraw altogether from the Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, in that they contend that the beginning of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of ourselves; so that in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as it were, of this precedent merit, the other good gifts of God are attained. Augustine shows that not only the increase, but the very beginning also of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is in God's gift. On this matter he does not disavow that he once thought differently, and that in some small works, written before his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, he was in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, as in that exposition, which they object to him, of propositions from the epistle to the Romans. But he points out that he was subsequently convinced chiefly by this testimony, <q>but what have you that you have not received?</q> which he proves is to be taken as a testimony concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself also. He says that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is to be counted among other works, which the apostle denies to anticipate God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> when He says, <q>not of works.</q> He declares that the hardness of the heart is taken away by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and that all come to Christ who are taught to come by the Father; but that those whom He teaches, He teaches in mercy, while those whom He teaches not, in judgment He teaches not. That the passage from his hundred and second epistle, Question 2, <q>concerning the time of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a></q> which is alleged by the semi-<a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, may rightly be explained without detriment to the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. He teaches what is the difference between <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. Further, he says that God in his <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> foreknew what he had purposed to do. He marvels greatly that the adversaries of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, who are said to be unwilling to be dependent on the uncertainty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, prefer rather to trust themselves to their own weakness than to</em>  <em>the strength of God's promise. He clearly points out that they abuse this authority, <q>If you believe, you shall be saved.</q> That the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and perseverance shines forth in the case of infants that are saved, who are distinguished by no merits of their own from others who perish. For that there is no difference between them arising from the foreknowledge of merits which they would have had if they had lived longer. That testimony is wrongfully rejected by the adversaries as being uncanonical, which he adduced for the purpose of this discussion, <q>he was taken away lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>,</q> etc. That the most illustrious instance of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the Saviour Himself, in whom a man obtained the privilege of being the Saviour and the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, through being assumed into oneness of person by the Word co-eternal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, on account of no precedent merits, either of works or of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. That the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> are called by some certain calling peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, and that they have been elected before the foundation of the world; not because they were foreknown as men who would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and would be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, but in order that by means of that very election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> they might be such, etc.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1 [I.]&mdash; Introduction.</h2>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in the Epistle to the Philippians the apostle said, <q>To write the same things to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safe;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153414"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse1">Philippians&nbsp;3:1</a></span> yet the same apostle writing to the Galatians when he saw that he had done enough among them of what he regarded as being needful for them, by the ministry of his preaching, said, <q>For the rest let no man <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> me labour,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153415"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse17">Galatians&nbsp;6:17</a></span> or as it is read in many codices, <q>Let no one be troublesome to me.</q> But although I confess that it causes me trouble that the divine word in which the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is preached (which is absolutely no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> if it is given according to our merits), great and manifest as it is, is not yielded to, nevertheless my dearest sons, Prosper and Hilary, your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and brotherly affection&mdash; which makes you so reluctant to see any of the brethren in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, as to wish that, after so many books and letters of mine on this subject, I should write again from here&mdash; I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> more than I can tell, although I do not dare to say that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it as much as I ought. Wherefore, behold, I write to you again. And although not with you, yet through you I am still doing what I thought I had done sufficiently.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; To What Extent the Massilians  Withdraw from the Pelagians.</h2>

<p>For on consideration of your letters, I seem to see that those brethren on whose behalf you exhibit a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> care that they may not hold the poetical opinion in which it is affirmed, <q>Every one is a hope for himself,</q>  and so fall under that condemnation which is, not poetically, but <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a>, declared, <q>Cursed is every man that has hope in man,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153418"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:5</a></span> must be treated in that way wherein the apostle dealt with those to whom he said, <q>And if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153419"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> For as yet they are in darkness on the question concerning the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but they have that whence, <q>if in anything they are otherwise minded, God will reveal even this unto them,</q> if they are walking in that to which they have attained. For which reason the apostle, when he had said, <q>If you are in anything otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you,</q> says, <q>Nevertheless whereunto we have attained, let us walk in the same.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153420"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse16">Philippians&nbsp;3:16</a></span> And those brethren of ours, on whose behalf your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is solicitous, have attained with Christ's Church to the belief that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is born obnoxious to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the first man, and that none can be delivered from that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> save by the righteousness of the Second Man. Moreover, they have attained to the confession that men's wills are anticipated by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and to the agreement that no one can suffice to himself either for beginning or for completing any good work. These things, therefore, unto which they have attained, being held fast, abundantly distinguish them from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>. Further, if they walk in them, and beseech Him who gives understanding, if in anything concerning <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> they are otherwise minded, He will reveal even this unto them. Yet let us also spend upon them the influence of our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and the ministry of our discourse, according to His gift, whom we have asked that in these letters we might say what should be suitable  and profitable to them. For whence do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether by this our service, wherein we are serving them in the free <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, our God may not perchance will to effect that purpose?</p>

<h2>Chapter 3 [II.]&mdash; Even the Beginning of Faith is of God's Gift.</h2>

<p>Therefore I ought first to show that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by which we are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if I can do that more thoroughly than I have already done in so many and so large volumes. But I see that I must now reply to those who say that the divine testimonies which I have adduced concerning this matter are of avail for this purpose, to assure us that we have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself of ourselves, but that its increase is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were not given to us by Him, but were only increased in us by Him, on the ground of the merit of its having begun from us. Thus there is here no departure from that opinion which Pelagius himself was constrained to condemn in the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Palestine, as is testified in the same Proceedings, <q>That the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is given according to our merits,</q>  if it is not of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that we begin to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but rather that on account of this beginning an addition is made to us of a more full and perfect belief; and so we first give the beginning of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that His supplement may also be given to us again, and whatever else we faithfully ask.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; Continuation of the Preceding.</h2>

<p>But why do we not in opposition to this, rather hear the words, <q>Who has first given to Him and it shall be recompensed to him again? Since of Him, and through Him, and in Him, are all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153423"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse35">Romans&nbsp;11:35</a></span> And from whom, then, is that very beginning of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> if not from Him? For this is not excepted when other things are spoken of as of Him; but <q>of Him, and through Him, and in Him, are <em>all</em> things.</q> But who can say that he who has already begun to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> deserves nothing from Him in whom he has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>? Whence it results that, to him who already deserves, other things are said to be added by a divine retribution, and thus that God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given according to our merits. And this assertion when put before him, Pelagius himself condemned, that he might not be condemned. Whoever, then, wishes on every side to avoid this condemnable opinion, let him understand that what the apostle says is said with entire <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfulness</a>, <q>Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ not only to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, but also to suffer for His sake.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153424"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse29">Philippians&nbsp;1:29</a></span> He shows that both are the gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because he said that both were given. And he does not say, <q>to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him more fully and perfectly,</q> but, <q>to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him.</q> Neither does he say that he himself had obtained mercy to be more faithful, but <q>to be faithful,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153425"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:25</a></span> because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he had not first given the beginning of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and had its increase given back to him again by Him; but that he had been made faithful by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who also had made him an apostle. For the beginnings of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are recorded, and they are very well known by being read in the church on an occasion calculated to distinguish them:  how, being turned away from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he was destroying, and being vehemently opposed to it, he was suddenly by a more powerful <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> converted to it, by the conversion of Him, to whom as One who would do this very thing it was said by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>You will turn and quicken us;</q>  so that not only from one who refused to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> he was made a willing believer, but, moreover, from being a persecutor, he suffered <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in defence of that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Because it was given him by Christ <q>not only to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, but also to suffer for His sake.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; To Believe is to Think with Assent.</h2>

<p>And, therefore, commending that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is not given according to any merits, but is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all good merits, he says, <q>Not that we are sufficient to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153428"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> Let them give attention to this, and well weigh these words, who think that the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of ourselves, and the supplement of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For who cannot see that thinking is prior to believing? For no one believes anything unless he has first thought that it is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. For however suddenly, however rapidly, some thoughts fly before the will to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and this presently follows in such wise as to attend them, as it were, in closest conjunction, it is yet necessary that everything which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> after thought has preceded; although even belief itself is nothing else than to think with assent. For it is not every one who thinks that believes, since many think in order that they may not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; but everybody who believes, thinks&mdash;both thinks in believing and believes in thinking. Therefore in what pertains to religion and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> (of which the apostle was speaking), if we are not capable of thinking anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we are certainly not capable of believing anything as of ourselves, since we cannot do this without thinking; but our sufficiency, by which we begin to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore, as no one is sufficient for himself, for the beginning or the completion of any good work whatever&mdash;and this those brethren of yours, as what you have written intimates, already agree to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whence, as well in the beginning as in the carrying out of every good work, our sufficiency is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;so no one is sufficient for himself, either to begin or to perfect <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but our sufficiency is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Because if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not a matter of thought, it is of no account; and we are not sufficient to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; Presumption and Arrogance to Be Avoided.</h2>

<p>Care must be taken, brethren, beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that a man do not lift himself up in opposition to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he says that he does what God has promised. Was not the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the nations promised to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <q>and he, giving <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, most fully <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that what He promised He is able also to perform</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note153429"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;4:20</a></span> He therefore makes the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, who is able to do what He has promised. Further, if God works our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, acting in a wonderful manner in our hearts so that we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, is there any reason to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that He cannot do the whole; and does man on that account arrogate to himself its first elements, that he may merit to receive its last from God? Consider if in such a way any other result be gained than that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is given in some way or other, according to our merit, and so <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is no more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For on this principle it is rendered as debt, it is not given gratuitously; for it is due to the believer that his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself should be increased by the Lord, and that the increased <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should be the wages of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> begun; nor is it observed when this is said, that this wage is assigned to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, not of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but of debt. And I do not at all see why the whole should not be attributed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>&mdash;as he who could originate for himself what he had not previously, can himself increase what he had originated&mdash;except that it is impossible to withstand the most manifest divine testimony by which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whence <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> takes its beginning, is shown also to be the gift of God: such as is that testimony that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has dealt to every man the measure of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153430"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;12:3</a></span> and that one, <q>Peace be to the brethren, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153431"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse23">Ephesians&nbsp;6:23</a></span> and other similar passages. Man, therefore, unwilling to resist such clear testimonies as these, and yet desiring himself to have the merit of believing, compounds as it were with God to claim a portion of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for himself, and to leave a portion for Him; and, what is still more arrogant, he takes the first portion for himself and gives the subsequent to Him; and so in that which he says belongs to both, he makes himself the first, and God the second!</p>

<h2>Chapter 7 [III.]&mdash; Augustine Confesses that He Had Formerly Been in Error Concerning the Grace of God.</h2>

<p>It was not thus that that <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> teacher thought&mdash; I speak of the most blessed Cyprian&mdash; when he said <q>that we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own.</q>  And in order to show this, he appealed to the apostle as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, where he said, <q>For what have you that you have not received? And if you have received it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153433"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> And it was chiefly by this testimony that I myself also was convinced when I was in a similar <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, thinking that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God is not God's gift, but that it is in us from ourselves, and that by it we obtain the gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby we may live temperately and righteously and piously in this world. For I did not think that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was preceded by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so that by its means would be given to us what we might profitably ask, except that we could not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> if the proclamation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> did not precede; but that we should consent when the gospel was preached to us I thought was our own doing, and came to us from ourselves. And this my <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is sufficiently indicated in some small works of mine written before my <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. Among these is that which you have mentioned in your letters  wherein is an exposition of certain propositions from the Epistle to the Romans. Eventually, when I was retracting all my small works, and was committing that retractation to writing, of which task I had already completed two books before I had taken up your more lengthy letters&mdash;when in the first volume I had reached the retractation of this book, I then spoke thus:&mdash; Also discussing, I say, 'what God could have chosen in him who was as yet unborn, whom He said that the elder should serve; and what in the same elder, equally as yet unborn, He could have rejected; concerning whom, on this account, the prophetic testimony is recorded, although declared long subsequently, <q>Jacob have I loved, and <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> have I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>,</q>'  I carried out my reasoning to the point of saying: 'God did not therefore choose the works of any one in foreknowledge of what He Himself would give them, but he chose the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in the foreknowledge that He would choose that very person whom He foreknew would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him&mdash;to whom He would give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, so that by doing good works he might obtain <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life also.' I had not yet very carefully sought, nor had I as yet found, what is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, of which the apostle says, 'A remnant are saved according to the election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note153436"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;11:5</a></span> Which assuredly is not <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> if any merits precede it; lest what is now given, not according to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but according to debt, be rather paid to merits than freely given. And what I next subjoined: 'For the same apostle says, <q>The same God which works all in all;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153437"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:6</a></span> but it was never said, God <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> all in all;' and then added, 'Therefore what we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is our own, but what good thing we do is of Him who gives the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>:' I certainly could not have said, had I already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself also is found among those gifts of God which are given by the same Spirit. Both, therefore, are ours on account of the choice of the will, and yet both are given by the spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not alone but as it is written, 'Love with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note153438"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse23">Ephesians&nbsp;6:23</a></span> And what I said a little after, 'For it is ours to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and to will, but it is His to give to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and will, the power of doing good works through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, by whom <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is shed abroad in our hearts,'&mdash; is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> indeed; but by the same rule both are also God's, because God prepares the will; and both are ours too, because they are only brought about with our good wills. And thus what I subsequently said also: 'Because we are not able to will unless we are called; and when, after our calling, we would will, our willing is not sufficiently nor our running, unless God gives strength to us that run, and leads us whither He calls us;' and thereupon added: 'It is plain, therefore, that it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy, that we do good works'&mdash; this is absolutely most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But I discovered little concerning the calling itself, which is according to God's purpose; for not such is the calling of all that are called, but only of the elect. Therefore what I said a little afterwards: 'For as in those whom God elects it is not works but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that begins the merit so as to do good works by the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so in those whom He condemns, unbelief and impiety begin the merit of punishment, so that even by way of punishment itself they do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works'&mdash; I spoke most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>. But that even the merit itself of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was God's gift, I neither thought of inquiring into, nor did I say. And in another place I say: 'For whom He has mercy upon, He makes to do good works, and whom He hardens He leaves to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works; but that mercy is bestowed upon the preceding merit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that hardening is applied to preceding iniquity.' And this indeed is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but it should further have been asked, whether even the merit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not come from God's mercy&mdash;that is, whether that mercy is manifested in man only because he is a believer, or whether it is also manifested that he may be a believer? For we read in the apostle's words: 'I obtained mercy to be a believer.' <span class="stiki" id="note153439"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:25</a></span> He does not say, 'Because I was a believer.' Therefore although it is given to the believer, yet it has been given also that he may be a believer. Therefore also, in another place in the same book I most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said: 'Because, if it is of God's mercy, and not of works, that we are even called that we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and it is granted to us who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to do good works, that mercy must not be grudged to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>;'&mdash; although I there discoursed less carefully about that calling which is given according to God's purpose. </p>

<h2>Chapter 8 [IV.]&mdash; What Augustine Wrote to Simplicianus, the Successor of Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.</h2>

<p>You see plainly what was at that time my opinion concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and works, although I was labouring in commending God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and in this opinion I see that those brethren of ours now are, because they have not been as careful to make progress with me in my writings as they were in reading them. For if they had been so careful, they would have found that question solved in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> in the first book of the two which I wrote in the very beginning of my <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> to Simplicianus, of blessed memory, Bishop of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Milan, and successor to St. Ambrose. Unless, perchance, they may not have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> these books; in which case, take care that they do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them. Of this first of those two books, I first spoke in the second book of the <em> Retractations</em>; and what I said is as follows: <q>Of the books, I say, on which, as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, I have laboured, the first two are addressed to Simplicianus, president of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Milan, who succeeded the most blessed Ambrose, concerning various questions, two of which I gathered into the first book from the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the Apostle to the Romans. The former of them is about what is written: 'What shall we say, then? Is the law <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? By no means;' <span class="stiki" id="note153441"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;7:7</a></span> as far as the passage where he says, 'Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord.' <span class="stiki" id="note153442"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24</a></span> And therein I have expounded those words of the apostle: 'The law is spiritual; but I am carnal,' <span class="stiki" id="note153443"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;7:14</a></span> and others in which the flesh is declared to be in conflict against the Spirit in such a way as if a man were there described as still under law, and not yet established under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For, long afterwards, I perceived that those words might even be (and probably were) the utterance of a spiritual man. The latter question in this book is gathered from that passage where the apostle says, 'And not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one act of intercourse, even by our father Isaac,' <span class="stiki" id="note153444"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;9:10</a></span> as far as that place where he says, 'Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we should be as Sodoma, and should have been like <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note153445"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;9:29</a></span> In the solution of this question I laboured indeed on behalf of the free choice of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, but God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> overcame, and I could only reach that point where the apostle is perceived to have said with the most evident <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, 'For who makes you to differ? And what have you that you have not received? Now, if you have received it, why do you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as if you received it not?' <span class="stiki" id="note153446"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> And this the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Cyprian was also desirous of setting forth when he compressed the whole of it in that title: 'That we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own.'</q>  This is why I previously said that it was chiefly by this apostolic testimony that I myself had been convinced, when I thought otherwise concerning this matter; and this God revealed to me as I sought to solve this question when I was writing, as I said, to the Bishop Simplicianus. This testimony, therefore, of the apostle, when for the sake of repressing man's conceit he said, <q>For what have you which you have not received?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153448"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> does not allow any believer to say, I have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which I received not. All the arrogance of this answer is absolutely repressed by these apostolic words. Moreover, it cannot even be said, <q>Although I have not a perfected <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, yet I have its beginning, whereby I first of all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> Because here also is answered: <q>But what have you that you have not received? Now, if you have received it, why do you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as if you received it not?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 9 [V.]&mdash; The Purpose of the Apostle in These Words.</h2>

<p>The notion, however, which they entertain, <q>that these words, 'What have you that you have not received?' cannot be said of this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because it has remained in the same nature, although corrupted, which at first was endowed with health and perfection,</q>  is perceived to have no force for the purpose that they desire if it be considered why the apostle said these words. For he was concerned that no one should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in man, because dissensions had sprung up among the Corinthian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, so that every one was saying, <q>I, indeed, am of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and another, I am of Apollos, and another, I am of Cephas;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153450"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:12</a></span> and thence he went on to say: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the strong things; and God has chosen the ignoble things of the world, and contemptible things, and those things which are not, to make of no account things which are; that no flesh should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> before God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153451"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:27</a></span> Here the intention of the apostle is of a certainty sufficiently plain against the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that no one should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in man; and thus, no one should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in himself. Finally, when he had said <q>that no flesh should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> in order to show in what man ought to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, he immediately added, <q>But it is of Him that you are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, who is made unto us wisdom from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: that according as it is written, He that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a>, let him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153452"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse30">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:30</a></span> Thence that intention of his progressed, till afterwards rebuking them he says, <q>For you are yet carnal; for whereas there are among you envying and contention, are you not carnal, and walk according to man? For while one says I am of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and another, I am of Apollos, are you not men? What, then, is Apollos, and what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? Ministers by whom you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; and to every one as the Lord has given. I have planted, and Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. Therefore, neither is he that plants anything, nor he that waters, but God that gives the increase.</q>  Do you not see that the sole purpose of the apostle is that man may be humbled, and God alone exalted? Since in all those things, indeed, which are planted and watered, he says that not even are the planter and the waterer anything, but God who gives the increase: and the very fact, also, that one plants and another waters he attributes not to themselves, but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he says, <q>To every one as the Lord has given; I have planted, Apollos watered.</q> Hence, therefore, persisting in the same intention he comes to the point of saying, <q>Therefore let no man <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in man,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153454"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:21</a></span> for he had already said, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a>, let him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord.</q> After these and some other matters which are associated therewith, that same intention of his is carried on in the words: <q>And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes, that you might learn in us that no one of you should be puffed up for one against another above that which is written. For who makes you to differ? And what have you which you have not received? Now, if you have received it, why do you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as if you received it not?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153455"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:6</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; It is God's Grace Which Specially Distinguishes One Man from Another.</h2>

<p>In this the apostle's most evident intention, in which he speaks against <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, so that none should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in man but in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is too absurd, as I think, to suppose God's natural gifts, whether man's entire and perfected nature itself as it was bestowed on him in his first state, or the remains, whatever they may be, of his degraded nature. For is it by such gifts as these, which are common to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that men are distinguished from men? But here he first said, <q>For who makes you to differ?</q> and then added, <q>And what have you that you have not received?</q> Because a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, puffed up against another, might say, <q>My <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> makes me to differ,</q> or <q>My righteousness,</q> or anything else of the kind. In reply to such notions, the good teacher says, <q>But what have you that you have not received?</q> And from whom but from Him who makes you to differ from another, on whom He bestowed not what He bestowed on you? <q>Now if,</q> says he, <q>you have received it, why do you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as if you received it not?</q> Is he concerned, I ask, about anything else save that he who <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord? But nothing is so opposed to this feeling as for any one to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> concerning his own merits in such a way as if he himself had made them for himself, and not the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, however, which makes the good to differ from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and is not common to the good and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Let the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, therefore, whereby we are living and reasonable creatures, and are distinguished from cattle, be attributed to nature; let that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> also by which, among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> themselves, the handsome are made to differ from the ill-formed, or the intelligent from the stupid, or anything of that kind, be ascribed to nature. But he whom the apostle was rebuking did not puff himself up as contrasted with cattle, nor as contrasted with any other man, in respect of any natural endowment which might be found even in the worst of men. But he ascribed to himself, and not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, some good gift which pertained to a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life, and was puffed up therewith when he deserved to hear the rebuke, <q>Who has made you to differ? And what have you that you received not?</q> For though the capacity to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of nature, is it also of nature to have it? <q>For all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153456"><a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> although all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have the capacity to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But the apostle does not say, <q>And what have you capacity to have, the capacity to have which you received not?</q> but he says, <q>And what have you which you received not?</q> Accordingly, the capacity to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,  as the capacity to have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, belongs to men's nature; but to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, even as to have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. That nature, therefore, in which is given to us the capacity of having <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, does not distinguish man from man, but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself makes the believer to differ from the unbeliever. And thus, when it is said, <q>For who makes you to differ? And what have you that you received not?</q> if any one dare to say, <q>I have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of myself, I did not, therefore, receive it,</q> he directly contradicts this most manifest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash;not because it is not in the choice of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> will to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> or not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but because in the elect the will is prepared by the Lord. Thus, moreover, the passage, <q>For who makes you to differ? And what have you that you received not?</q> refers to that very <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of man.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11 [VI.]&mdash; That Some Men are Elected is of God's Mercy.</h2>

<p><q>Many hear the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but some <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, while others contradict. Therefore, the former will to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; the latter do not will.</q> Who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this? Who can deny this? But since in some the will is prepared by the Lord, in others it is not prepared, we must assuredly be able to distinguish what comes from God's mercy, and what from His judgment. <q>What <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> sought for,</q> says the apostle, <q>he has not obtained, but the election has obtained it; and the rest were blinded, as it is written, God gave to them the spirit of compunction&mdash;eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, even to this day. And David said, Let their table be made a snare, a retribution, and a stumblingblock to them; let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see; and bow down their back always.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153458"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;11:7</a></span> Here is mercy and judgment,&mdash; mercy towards the election which has obtained the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but judgment to the rest which have been blinded. And yet the former, because they willed,  <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; the latter, because they did not will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not. Therefore mercy and judgment were manifested in the very wills themselves. Certainly such an election is of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not at all of merits. For he had before said, <q>So, therefore, even at this present time, the remnant has been saved by the election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And if by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, now it is no more of works; otherwise <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is no more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153460"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;11:5</a></span> Therefore the election obtained what it obtained gratuitously; there preceded none of those things which they might first give, and it should be given to them again. He saved them for nothing. But to the rest who were blinded, as is there plainly declared, it was done in recompense. <q>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>  But His ways are unsearchable. Therefore the mercy by which He freely delivers, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by which He righteously judges, are equally unsearchable.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12 [VII.]&mdash; Why the Apostle Said that We are Justified by Faith and Not by Works.</h2>

<p>But perhaps it may be said: <q>The apostle distinguishes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from works; he says, indeed, that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not of works, but he does not say that it is not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> This, indeed, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But Jesus says that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself also is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and commands us to work it. For the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said to Him, <q>What shall we do that we may work the work of God? Jesus answered, and said unto them, This is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him whom He has sent.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153462"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;6:28</a></span> The apostle, therefore, distinguishes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from works, just as Judah is distinguished from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in the two kingdoms of the Hebrews, although Judah is <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> itself. And he says that a man is justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and not by works, because <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself is first given, from which may be obtained other things which are specially characterized as works, in which a man may live righteously. For he himself also says, <q>By <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> you are saved through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and this not of yourselves; but it is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153463"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> &mdash; that is to say, <q>And in saying 'through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,' even <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself is not of yourselves, but is God's gift.</q> <q>Not of works,</q> he says, <q>lest any man should be lifted up.</q> For it is often said, <q>He deserved to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, because he was a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man even before he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</q> Which may be said of Cornelius <span class="stiki" id="note153464"><a href="../bible/act010.htm">Acts&nbsp;x</a></span> since his <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> were accepted and his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> heard before he had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Christ; and yet without some <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he neither gave <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> nor <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>. For how did he call on him on whom he had not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>? But if he could have been saved without the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Christ the Apostle Peter would not have been sent as an architect to build him up; although, <q>Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain who build it.</q>  And we are told, Faith is of ourselves; other things which pertain to works of righteousness are of the Lord; as if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> did not belong to the building&mdash;as if, I say, the foundation did not belong to the building. But if this primarily and especially belongs to it, he labours in vain who seeks to build up the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by preaching, unless the Lord in His mercy builds it up from within. Whatever, therefore, of good works Cornelius performed, as well before he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Christ as when he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and after he had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, are all to be ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lest, perchance any man be lifted up.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13 [VIII.]&mdash; The Effect of Divine Grace.</h2>

<p>Accordingly, our only Master and Lord Himself, when He had said what I have above mentioned&mdash;<q>This is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him whom He has sent,</q>&mdash; says a little afterwards in that same discourse of His, <q>I said unto you that you also have seen me and have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. All that the Father gives me shall come to me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153466"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;6:36</a></span> What is the meaning of <q>shall come to me,</q> but, <q>shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me</q>? But it is the Father's gift that this may be the case. Moreover, a little after He says, <q>Murmur not among yourselves. No one can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him; and I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, And they shall be all teachable  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Every man that has heard of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and has learned, comes unto me.</q>  What is the meaning of, <q>Every man that has heard from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and has learned, comes unto me,</q> except that there is none who hears from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and learns, who comes not to me? For if every one who has heard from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and has learned, comes, certainly every one who does not come has not heard from the Father; for if he had heard and learned, he would come. For no one has heard and learned, and has not come; but every one, as the Truth declares, who has heard from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and has learned, comes. Far removed from the senses of the flesh is this teaching in which the Father is heard, and teaches to come to the Son. Engaged herein is also the Son Himself, because He is His Word by which He thus teaches; and He does not do this through the ear of the flesh, but of the heart. Herein engaged, also, at the same time, is the Spirit of the Father and of the Son; and He, too, teaches, and does not teach separately, since we have learned that the workings of the Trinity are inseparable. And that is certainly the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of whom the apostle says, <q>We, however, having the same Spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153469"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> But this is especially attributed to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for the reason that of Him is begotten the Only Begotten, and from Him proceeds the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, of which it would be tedious to argue more elaborately; and I think that my work in fifteen books on the Trinity which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is, has already reached you. Very far removed, I say, from the senses of the flesh is this instruction wherein God is heard and teaches. We see that many come to the Son because we see that many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ, but when and how they have heard this from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and have learned, we see not. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is exceedingly secret, but who doubts that it is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>? This <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, therefore, which is hiddenly bestowed in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> hearts by the Divine gift, is rejected by no hard heart, because it is given for the sake of first taking away the hardness of the heart. When, therefore, the Father is heard within, and teaches, so that a man comes to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, He takes away the heart of stone and gives a heart of flesh, as in the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> He has promised. Because He thus makes them children and vessels of mercy which He has prepared for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; Why the Father Does Not Teach All that They May Come to Christ.</h2>

<p>Why, then, does He not teach all that they may come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, except because all whom He teaches, He teaches in mercy, while those whom He teaches not, in judgment He teaches not? Since, <q>On whom He will He has mercy, and whom He will He hardens.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153470"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;9:18</a></span> But He has mercy when He gives <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. He hardens when He recompenses what is deserved. Or if, as some would prefer to distinguish them, those words also are his to whom the apostle says, <q>You say then unto me,</q> so that he may be regarded as having said, <q>Therefore has He mercy on whom He will, and whom He will He hardens,</q> as well as those which follow&mdash;to wit, <q>What is it that is still complained of? For who resists His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>?</q> does the apostle answer, <q>O man, what you have said is false?</q> No; but he says, <q>O man, who are you that repliest against God? Does the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why have you made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump?</q>  and what follows, which you very well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. And yet in a certain sense the Father teaches all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to come to His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. For it was not in vain that it was written in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <q>And they shall all be teachable of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153472"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse45">John&nbsp;6:45</a></span> And when He too had premised this testimony, He added, <q>Every man, therefore, who has heard of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and has learned, comes to me.</q> As, therefore, we speak <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> when we say concerning any teacher of literature who is alone in a city, He teaches literature here to everybody&mdash;not that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> learn, but that there is none who learns literature there who does not learn from him&mdash;so we <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> say, God teaches all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not because all come, but because none comes in any other way. And why He does not teach all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the apostle explained, as far as he judged that it was to be explained, because, <q>willing to show His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and to exhibit His power, He endured with much patience the vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> which were perfected for destruction; and that He might make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the riches of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on the vessels of mercy which He has prepared for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153473"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse22">Romans&nbsp;9:22</a></span> Hence it is that the <q>word of the cross is foolishness to them that perish; but unto them that are saved it is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153474"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:18</a></span> God teaches all such to come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for He wills all such to be saved, and to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And if He had willed to teach even those to whom the word of the cross is foolishness to come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> these also would have come. For He neither deceives nor is deceived when He says, <q>Everyone that has heard of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and has learned, comes to me.</q> Away, then, with the thought that any one comes not, who has heard of the Father and has learned.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; It is Believers that are Taught of God.</h2>

<p><q>Why,</q> say they, <q>does He not teach all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>?</q> If we should say that they whom He does not teach are unwilling to learn, we shall be met with the answer: And what becomes of what is said to Him, <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, You will turn us again, and quicken us</q>?  Or if God does not make men willing who were not willing, on what principle does the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, according to the Lord's commandment, for her persecutors? For thus also the blessed Cyprian  would have it to be understood that we say, <q>Your will be done, as in heaven so in earth,</q>&mdash; that is, as in those who have already <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and who are, as it were, <em>heaven</em>, so also in those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and on this account are still <em>the earth.</em> What, then, do we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for on behalf of those who are unwilling to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, except that God would work in them to will also? Certainly the apostle says, <q>Brethren, my heart's good will, indeed, and my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to God for them, is for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153477"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;10:1</a></span> He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>&mdash;for what, except that they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? For in no other way do they obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. If, then, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the petitioners precede the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of them on whose behalf <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is made that they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> precede the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God?&mdash; since this is the very thing that is besought for them, that on them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not&mdash; that is, who have not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash; <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself may be bestowed? When, therefore, the gospel is preached, some <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, some <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not; but they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> at the voice of the preacher from without, hear of the Father from within, and learn; while they who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, hear outwardly, but inwardly do not hear nor learn&mdash;that is to say, to the former it is given to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; to the latter it is not given. Because <q>no man,</q> says He, <q>comes to me, except the Father which sent me draw him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153478"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;6:44</a></span> And this is more plainly said afterwards. For after a little time, when He was speaking of eating his flesh and drinking His blood, and some even of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> said, <q>This is a hard saying, who can hear it? Jesus, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> in Himself that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> murmured at this, said unto them, Does this offend you?</q>  And a little after He said, <q>The words that I have spoken unto you are spirit and life; but there are some among you which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not.</q>  And immediately the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says, <q>For Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> from the beginning who were the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and who should betray Him; and He said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me except it were given him of my Father.</q> Therefore, to be drawn to Christ by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and to hear and learn of the Father in order to come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is nothing else than to receive from the Father the gift by which to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For it was not the hearers of the gospel that were distinguished from those who did not hear, but the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> from those who did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, by Him who said, <q>No man comes to me except it were given him of my Father.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; Why the Gift of Faith is Not Given to All.</h2>

<p>Faith, then, as well in its beginning as in its completion, is God's gift; and let no one have any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whatever, unless he desires to resist the plainest sacred writings, that this gift is given to some, while to some it is not given. But why it is not given to all ought not to disturb the believer, who believes that from one all have gone into a condemnation, which undoubtedly is most righteous; so that even if none were delivered therefrom, there would be no just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for finding fault with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Whence it is plain that it is a great <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for many to be delivered, and to acknowledge in those that are not delivered what would be due to themselves; so that he that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> not in his own merits, which he sees to be equalled in those that are condemned, but in the Lord. But why He delivers one rather than another&mdash;<q>His judgments are unsearchable, and His ways past finding out.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153481"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse33">Romans&nbsp;11:33</a></span> For it is better in this case for us to hear or to say, <q>O man, who are you that repliest against God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153482"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;9:20</a></span> than to dare to speak as if we could <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what He has chosen to be kept secret. Since, moreover, He could not will anything unrighteous.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17 [IX.]&mdash; His Argument in His Letter Against Porphyry, as to Why the Gospel Came So Late into the World.</h2>

<p>But that which you remember my saying in a certain small treatise of mine against Porphyry, under the title of <em>The Time of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Religion</em>, I so said for the sake of escaping this more careful and elaborate argument about <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; although its meaning, which could be unfolded elsewhere or by others, was not wholly omitted, although I had been unwilling in that place to explain it. For, among other matters, I spoke thus in answer to the question proposed, why it was after so long a time that Christ came: <q>Accordingly, I say, since they do not object to Christ that all do not follow His teaching (for even they themselves feel that this could not be objected at all with any <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, either to the wisdom of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> or even to the deity of their own gods), what will they reply, if&mdash; leaving out of the question that depth of God's wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> where perchance some other divine plan is far more secretly hidden, without prejudging also other causes, which cannot be traced out by the wise&mdash; we say to them only this, for the sake of brevity in the arguing of this question, that Christ willed to appear to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and that His doctrine should be preached among them, at that time when He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, and at that place where He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, that there were some who would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. For at those times, and in those places, at which His gospel was not preached, He foreknew that all would be in His preaching such as, not indeed all, but many were in His bodily presence, who would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, even when the dead were raised by Him; such as we see many now, who, although the declarations of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> concerning Him are fulfilled by such manifestations, are still unwilling to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and prefer to resist by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> astuteness, rather than yield to divine authority so clear and perspicuous, and so lofty, and sublimely made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, so long as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> understanding is small and weak in its approach to divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. What wonder is it, then, if Christ <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the world in former ages to be so full of unbelievers, that He should reasonably refuse to appear, or to be preached to them, who, as He foreknew, would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> neither His words nor His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>? For it is not incredible that all at that time were such as from His coming even to the present time we marvel that so many have been and are. And yet from the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, sometimes more hiddenly, sometimes more evidently, even as to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> the times seemed to be fitting, there has neither been a failure of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, nor were there wanting those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him; as well from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, as in the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> itself which by a certain special <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> was a prophetic people; and in other nations before He had come in the flesh. For as some are mentioned in the sacred Hebrew books, as early as the time of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>&mdash;neither of his fleshly race nor of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> nor of the foreign society among the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>&mdash;who were, nevertheless, sharers in their sacrament, why may we not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there were others elsewhere among other people, here and there, although we do not read any mention of them in the same authorities? Thus the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of this religion, by which only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> promised, never failed him who was worthy of it; and whoever it failed was not worthy of it. And from the very beginning of the propagation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, even to the end, the gospel is preached, to some for a reward, to some for judgment; and thus also those to whom the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was not announced at all were foreknown as those who would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; and those to whom it was announced, although they were not such as would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, are set forth as an example for the former; while those to whom it is announced who should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, are prepared for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and the company of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; The Preceding Argument Applied to the Present Time.</h2>

<p>Do you not see that my desire was, without any prejudgment of the hidden counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of other reasons, to say what might seem sufficient about Christ's foreknowledge, to convince the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> who had brought forward this question? For what is more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> than that Christ foreknew who should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, and at what times and places they should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? But whether by the preaching of Christ to themselves by themselves they were to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or whether they would receive it by God's gift,&mdash; that is, whether God only foreknew them, or also <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> them, I did not at that time think it necessary to inquire or to discuss. Therefore what I said, <q>that Christ willed to appear to men at that time, and that His doctrine should be preached among them when He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, and where He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, that there were those who would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him,</q> may also thus be said, <q>That Christ willed to appear to men at that time, and that His gospel should be preached among those, whom He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, and where He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, that there were those who had been elected in Himself before the foundation of the world.</q> But since, if it were so said, it would make the reader desirous of asking about those things which now by the warning of Pelagian <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> must of necessity be discussed with greater copiousness and care, it seemed to me that what at that time was sufficient should be briefly said, leaving to one side, as I said, the depth of the wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and without prejudging other reasons, concerning which I thought that we might more fittingly argue, not then, but at some other time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19 [X]&mdash; In What Respects Predestination and Grace Differ.</h2>

<p>Moreover, that which I said, <q>That the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of this religion has never been lacking to him who was worthy of it, and that he to whom it was lacking was not worthy,</q>&mdash; if it be discussed and it be asked whence any man can be worthy, there are not wanting those who say&mdash; by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will. But we say, by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. Further, between <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> there is only this difference, that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is the preparation for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, while <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the donation itself. When, therefore the apostle says, <q>Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus in good works,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153484"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse9">Ephesians&nbsp;2:9-10</a></span> it is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; but what follows&mdash; <q>which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has prepared that we should walk in them</q>&mdash; is <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, which cannot exist without foreknowledge, although foreknowledge may exist without <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>; because God foreknew by <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> those things which He was about to do, whence it was said, <q>He made those things that shall be.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153485"><a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;45:11</a></span> Moreover, He is able to foreknow even those things which He does not Himself do&mdash;as all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> whatever. Because, although there are some which are in such wise <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as that they are also the penalties of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, whence it is said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave them over to a reprobate <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to do those things which are not convenient,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153486"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;1:28</a></span> it is not in such a case the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is God's, but the judgment. Therefore God's <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of good is, as I have said, the preparation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the effect of that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. Therefore when God promised to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in his seed the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, saying, <q>I have established you a father of many nations,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153487"><a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse5">Genesis&nbsp;17:5</a></span> whence the apostle says, <q>Therefore it is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that the promise, according to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, might be established to all the seed,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153488"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse16">Romans&nbsp;4:16</a></span> He promised not from the power of our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> but from His own <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. For He promised what He Himself would do, not what men would do. Because, although men do those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which pertain to God's worship, He Himself makes them to do what He has commanded; it is not they that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> Him to do what He has promised. Otherwise the fulfilment of God's promises would not be in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in that of men; and thus what was promised by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> would be given to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> by men themselves. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, however, did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> thus, but <q>he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, giving <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that what He promised He is able also to do.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153489"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;4:21</a></span> He does not say, <q>to foretell</q>&mdash; he does not say, <q>to foreknow;</q> for He can foretell and foreknow the doings of strangers also; but he says, <q>He is able also to do;</q> and thus he is speaking not of the doings of others, but of His own.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; Did God Promise the Good Works of the Nations and Not Their Faith, to Abraham?</h2>

<p>Did <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, perchance, promise to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in his seed the good works of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, so as to promise that which He Himself does, but did not promise the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, which men do for themselves; but so as to promise what He Himself does, did He foreknow that men would effect that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? The apostle, indeed, does not speak thus, because God promised children to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who should follow the footsteps of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as he very plainly says. But if He promised the works, and not the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> certainly since they are not good works unless they are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (for <q>the righteous lives of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153490"><a href="../bible/hab002.htm#verse4">Habakkuk&nbsp;2:4</a></span> and, <q>Whatsoever is not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153491"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;14:23</a></span> and, <q>Without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is impossible to please</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153492"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;11:6</a></span>), it is nevertheless in man's power that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should fulfil what He has promised. For unless man should do what without the gift of God pertains to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he will not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> God to give&mdash;that is, unless man have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of himself. God does not fulfil what He has promised, that works of righteousness should be given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And thus that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be able to fulfil His promises is not in God's power, but man's. And if <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> do not forbid our believing this, let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that what He has promised He is able also to perform. But He promised children to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; and this men cannot be unless they have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, therefore He gives <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> also.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.&mdash; It is to Be Wondered at that Men Should Rather Trust to Their Own Weakness Than to God's Strength.</h2>

<p>Certainly, when the apostle says, <q>Therefore it is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that the promise may be sure according to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153493"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse16">Romans&nbsp;4:16</a></span> I marvel that men would rather entrust themselves to their own weakness, than to the strength of God's promise. But do you say, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> concerning myself is to me uncertain? What then? Is your own will concerning yourself certain to you? And do you not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>&mdash;<q>Let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note153494"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:12</a></span> Since, then, both are uncertain, why does not man commit his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the stronger will rather than to the weaker?</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; God's Promise is Sure.</h2>

<p><q>But,</q> say they, <q>when it is said, 'If you believe, you shall be saved,' one of these things is required; the other is offered. What is required is in man's power; what is offered is in God's.</q>  Why are not both in God's, as well what He commands as what He offers? For He is asked to give what He commands. Believers ask that their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be increased; they ask on behalf of those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be given to them; therefore both in its increase and in its beginnings, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it is said thus: <q>If you believe, you shall be saved,</q> in the same way that it is said, <q>If by the Spirit you shall mortify the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the flesh, you shall live.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153496"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;8:13</a></span> For in this case also, of these two things one is required, the other is offered. It is said, <q>If by the Spirit you shall mortify the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the flesh, you shall live.</q> Therefore, that we mortify the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the flesh is required, but that we may live is offered. Is it, then, fitting for us to say, that to mortify the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the flesh is not a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not to confess it to be a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because we hear it required of us, with the offer of life as a reward if we shall do it? Away with this being approved by the partakers and champions of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>! This is the condemnable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, whose mouths the apostle immediately stopped when he added, <q>For as many as are led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, they are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153497"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;8:14</a></span> lest we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we mortify the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the flesh, not by God's Spirit, but by our own. And of this <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, moreover, he was speaking in that place where he says, <q>But all these works that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing unto every man what is his own, as He will;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153498"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:11</a></span> and among all these things, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, he also named <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. As, therefore, although it is the gift of God to mortify the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the flesh, yet it is required of us, and life is set before us as a reward; so also <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although when it is said, <q>If you believe, you shall be saved,</q> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is required of us, and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is proposed to us as a reward. For these things are both commanded us, and are shown to be God's gifts, in order that we may understand both that we do them, and that God makes us to do them, as He most plainly says by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Ezekiel. For what is plainer than when He says, <q>I will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to do</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note153499"><a href="../bible/eze036.htm#verse27">Ezekiel&nbsp;36:27</a></span> Give heed to that passage of Scripture, and you will see that God promises that He will make them to do those things which He commands to be done. He <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is not silent as to the merits but as to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>, of those to whom He shows that He is returning good for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, by the very fact that He causes them thenceforth to have good works, in causing them to do the divine commands.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23 [XII.]&mdash; Remarkable Illustrations of Grace and Predestination in Infants, and in Christ.</h2>

<p>But all this reasoning, whereby we maintain that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that is, is not given according to our merits, although it is most manifestly asserted by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the divine declarations, yet, among those who think that they are withheld from all <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> unless they can attribute to themselves something, which they first give that it may be recompensed to them again, involves somewhat of a difficulty in respect of the condition of grown-up people, who are already exercising the choice of will. But when we come to the case of infants, and to the Mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> Himself, the man Christ Jesus, there is wanting all assertion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> merits that precede the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because the former are not distinguished from others by any preceding good merits that they should belong to the Deliverer of men; any more than He Himself being Himself a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, was made the Deliverer of men by virtue of any precedent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> merits.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.&mdash; That No One is Judged According to What He Would Have Done If He Had Lived Longer.</h2>

<p>For who can hear that infants, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the condition of mere infancy, are said to depart from this life by reason of their future merits, and that others not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> are said to die in the same age because their future merits are foreknown&mdash;but as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; so that God rewards or condemns in them not their good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> life, but no life at all?  The apostle, indeed, fixed a limit which man's incautious suspicion, to speak gently, ought not to transgress, for he says, <q>We shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ; that every one may receive according to the things which he has done by means of the body, whether it be good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153501"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:10</a></span> <q>Has done,</q> he said; and he did not add, <q>or would have done.</q> But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whence this thought should have entered the minds of such men, that infants' future merits (which shall not be) should be punished or honoured. But why is it said that a man is to be judged according to those things which he has done by means of the body, when many things are done by the mind alone, and not by the body, nor by any member of the body; and for the most part things of such importance, that a most righteous punishment would be due to such thought, such as&mdash;to say nothing of others&mdash;that <q>The fool has said in his heart there is no God</q>?  What, then, is the meaning of, <q>According to those things that he has done by means of the body,</q> except according to those things which he has done during that time in which he was in the body, so that we may understand <q>by means of the body</q> as meaning <q>throughout the season of bodily life</q>? But after the body, no one will be in the body except at the last resurrection,&mdash; not for the purpose of establishing any claims of merit, but for the sake of receiving recompenses for good merits, and enduring punishments for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> merits. But in this intermediate period between the putting off and the taking again of the body, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are either tormented or they are in repose, according to those things which they have done during the period of the bodily life. And to this period of the bodily life moreover pertains, what the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> deny, but Christ's Church confesses, original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and according to whether this is by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> loosed, or by God's judgment not loosed, when infants die, they pass, on the one hand, by the merit of regeneration from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to good, or on the other, by the merit of their origin from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> acknowledges this, and even some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, without any contradiction, agree to this. But in the height of wonder and astonishment I am unable to discover whence men, whose intelligence your letters show to be by no means contemptible, could entertain the opinion that any one should be judged not according to the merits that he had as long as he was in the body, but according to the merits which he would have had if he had lived longer in the body; and I should not dare to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there were such men, if I could venture to disbelieve you. But I hope that God will interpose, so that when they are admonished they may at once perceive, that if those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which, as is said, would have been, can rightly be punished by God's judgment in those who are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, they may alo be rightly remitted by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For whoever says that future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can only be punished by God's judgment, but cannot be pardoned by God's mercy, ought to consider how great a wrong he is doing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; as if future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> could be foreknown, and could not be foregone.  And if this is absurd, it is the greater reason that help should be afforded to those who would be sinners if they lived longer, when they die in early life, by means of that laver wherein <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are washed away.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25 [XIII.]&mdash; Possibly the Baptized Infants Would Have Repented If They Had Lived, and the Unbaptized Not.</h2>

<p>But if, perchance, they say that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are re-remitted to penitents, and that those who die in infancy are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> because they are foreknown as not such as would repent if they should live, while God has foreknown that those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and die in infancy would have repented if they had lived, let them observe and see that if it be so it is not in this case original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are punished in infants that die without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but what would have been the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of each one had he lived; and also in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> infants, that it is not original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that are washed away, but their own future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> if they should live, since they could not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> except in more mature age; but that some were foreseen as such as would repent, and others as such as would not repent, therefore some were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and others departed from this life without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. If the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> should dare to say this, by their denial of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> they would thus be relieved of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of seeking, on behalf of infants outside of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, for some place of I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of their own; especially since they are convinced that they cannot have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life because they have not eaten the flesh nor drank the blood of Christ; and because in them who have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which is given for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is falsified. For they would go on to say that there is no original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but that those who as infants are released are either <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> or not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> according to their future merits if they should live, and that according to their future merits they either receive or do not receive the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, without which they absolutely cannot have life; and are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> although they derived no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from Adam, because the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted unto them concerning which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreknew that they would repent. Thus with the greatest ease they would plead and would win their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in which they deny that there is any original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and contend that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is only given according to our merits. But that the future merits of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which merits will never come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> are beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> no merits at all, it is certainly most easy to see: for this reason even the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> were not able to say this; and much rather these ought not to say it. For it cannot be said with what pain I find that they who with us on catholic authority condemn the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, have not seen this, which the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> themselves have seen to be most false and absurd.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26 [XIV]&mdash; Reference to Cyprian's Treatise <q>On the Mortality.</q></h2>

<p>Cyprian wrote a work <em>On the Mortality</em>,  <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> with approval to many and almost all who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> literature, wherein he says that death is not only not disadvantageous to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, but that it is even found to be advantageous, because it withdraws men from the risks of sinning, and establishes them in a security of not sinning. But wherein is the advantage of this, if even future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which have not been committed are punished? Yet he argues most copiously and well that the risks of sinning are not wanting in this life, and that they do not continue after this life is done; where also he adduces that testimony from the book of Wisdom: <q>He was taken away, lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> should alter his understanding.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153505"><a href="../bible/wis004.htm#verse11">Wisdom&nbsp;4:11</a></span> And this was also adduced by me, though you said that those brethren of yours had rejected it on the ground of its not having been brought forward from a canonical book; as if, even setting aside the attestation of this book, the thing itself were not clear which I wished to be taught therefrom. For what <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> would dare to deny that the righteous man, if he should be prematurely laid hold of by death, will be in repose? Let who will, say this, and what man of sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will think that he can withstand it? Moreover, if he should say that the righteous man, if he should depart from his righteousness in which he has long lived, and should die in that impiety after having lived in it, I say not a year, but one day, will go hence into the punishment due to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, his righteousness having no power in the future to avail him&mdash;will any believer contradict this evident <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Further, if we are asked whether, if he had died then at the time that he was righteous, he would have incurred punishment or repose, shall we hesitate to answer, repose? This is the whole reason why it is said&mdash;whoever says it&mdash;<q>He was taken away lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> should alter his understanding.</q> For it was said in reference to the risks of this life, not with reference to the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who foreknew that which was to be, not that which was not to be&mdash; that is, that He would bestow on him an untimely death in order that he might be withdrawn from the uncertainty of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>; not that he would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since he was not to remain in <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. Because, concerning this life, we read in the book of Job, <q>Is not the life of man upon earth a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153506"><a href="../bible/job007.htm#verse1">Job&nbsp;7:1</a></span> But why it should be granted to some to be taken away from the perils of this life while they are righteous, while others who are righteous until they fall from righteousness are kept in the same risks in a more lengthened life&mdash;who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the mind of the Lord? And yet it is permitted to be understood from this, that even those righteous people who maintain good and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> characters, even to the maturity of old age and to the last day of this life, must not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in their own merits, but in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, since He who took away the righteous man from the shortness of life, lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> should alter his understanding, Himself guards the righteous man in any length of life, that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> may not alter his understanding. But why He should have kept the righteous man here to fall, when He might have withdrawn him before&mdash;His judgments, although absolutely righteous, are yet unsearchable.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27.&mdash; The Book of Wisdom Obtains in the Church the Authority of Canonical Scripture.</h2>

<p>And since these things are so, the judgment of the book of Wisdom ought not to be repudiated, since for so long a course of years that book has deserved to be read in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from the station of the readers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to be heard by all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, from <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> downwards, even to the lowest lay <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, penitents, and <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, with the veneration paid to divine authority. For assuredly, if, from those who have been before me in commenting on the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, I should bring forward a defence of this judgment, which we are now called upon to defend more carefully and copiously than usual against the new <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>&mdash;that is, that God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not given according to our merits, and that it is given freely to whom it is given, because it is neither of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy; but that by righteous judgment it is not given to whom it is not given, because there is no unrighteousness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;if, therefore, I should put forth a defence of this opinion from catholic commentators on the divine oracles who have preceded us, assuredly these brethren for whose sake I am now discoursing would acquiesce, for this you have intimated in your letters. What need is there, then, for us to look into the writings of those who, before this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> sprang up, had no necessity to be conversant in a question so difficult of solution as this, which beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> they would have done if they had been compelled to answer such things? Whence it arose that they touched upon what they thought of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> briefly in some passages of their writings, and cursorily; but on those matters which they argued against the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in exhortations to every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by which to serve the living and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God for the purpose of attaining <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, they dwelt at length. But the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what it could do, shows itself artlessly by its frequent mention in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; for what God commands to be done would not be asked for from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless it could be given by Him that it should be done.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28.&mdash; Cyprian's Treatise <q>On the Mortality.</q></h2>

<p>But if any wish to be instructed in the opinions of those who have handled the subject, it behooves them to prefer to all commentators the book of Wisdom, where it is read, <q>He was taken away, that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> should not alter his understanding;</q> because illustrious commentators, even in the times nearest to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, preferred it to themselves, seeing that when they made use of it for a testimony they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that they were making use of nothing but a divine testimony; and certainly it appears that the most blessed Cyprian, in order to commend the advantage of an earlier death, contended that those who end this life, wherein <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is possible, are taken away from the risks of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. In the same treatise, among other things, he says, <q>Why, when you are about to be with Christ, and are secure of the divine promise, do you not embrace being called to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that you are free from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>?</q>  And in another place he says, <q>Boys escape the peril of their unstable age.</q>  And again, in another place, he says, <q>Why do we not hasten and run, that we may see our country, that we may hail our <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>? A great number of those who are dear to us are expecting us there&mdash;a dense and abundant crowd of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, brethren, sons, are longing for us; already secure of their own safety, but still anxious about our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q>  By these and such like sentiments, that teacher sufficiently and plainly testifies, in the clearest light of the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that perils of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and trials are to be feared even until the putting off of this body, but that afterwards no one shall suffer any such things. And even if he did not testify thus, when could any manner of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> be in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on this matter? How, then, should it not have been of advantage to a man who has lapsed, and who finishes his life wretchedly in that same state of lapse, and passes into the punishment due to such as he&mdash;how, I say, should it not have been of the greatest and highest advantage to such an one to be snatched by death from this sphere of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> before his fall?</p>

<h2>Chapter 29.&mdash; God's Dealing Does Not Depend Upon Any Contingent Merits of Men.</h2>

<p>And thus, unless we indulge in reckless disputation, the entire question is concluded concerning him who is taken away lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> should alter his understanding. And the book of Wisdom, which for such a series of years has deserved to be read in Christ's Church, and in which this is read, ought not to suffer <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> because it withstands those who are mistaken on behalf of men's merit, so as to come in opposition to the most manifest <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God: and this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> chiefly appears in infants, and while some of these <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and some not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, come to the end of this life, they sufficiently point to God's mercy and His judgment,&mdash; His mercy, indeed, gratuitous, His judgment, of debt. For if men should be judged according to the merits of their life, which merits they have been prevented by death from actually having, but would have had if they had lived, it would be of no advantage to him who is taken away lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> should alter his understanding; it would be of no advantage to those who die in a state of lapse if they should die before. And this no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> will venture to say. Wherefore our brethren, who with us on behalf of the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> assail the pest of the Pelagian <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, ought not to such an extent to favour the Pelagian opinion, wherein they conceive that God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given according to our merits, as to endeavour (which they cannot dare) to invalidate a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sentiment, plainly and from ancient times <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>&mdash;<q>He was taken away, lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> should alter his understanding;</q> and to build up that which we should think, I do not say, no one would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but no one would dream,&mdash; to wit, that any deceased person would be judged according to those things which he would have done if he had lived for a more lengthened period. Surely thus what we say manifests itself clearly to be incontestable,&mdash; that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is not given according to our merits; so that ingenious men who contradict this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are constrained to say things which must be rejected from the ears and from the thoughts of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30 [XV.]&mdash; The Most Illustrious Instance of Predestination is Christ Jesus.</h2>

<p>Moreover, the most illustrious Light of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is the Saviour Himself&mdash;the Mediator Himself between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. And, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, by what preceding merits of its own, whether of works or of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, did the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which is in Him procure for itself that it should be this? Let this have an answer, I beg. That man, whence did He deserve this&mdash; to be assumed by the Word co-eternal with the Father into unity of person, and be the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? Was it because any kind of goodness in Him preceded? What did He do before? What did He <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? What did He ask, that He should attain to this unspeakable excellence? Was it not by the act and the assumption of the Word that that man, from the time He began to be, began to be the only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? Did not that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, conceive the only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? Was He not born the only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>&mdash;not of the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, but by God's peculiar gift? Was it to be feared that as age matured this man, He would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>? Or was the will in Him not free on that account? And was it not so much the more free in proportion to the greater impossibility of His becoming the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Certainly, in Him <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>&mdash; that is to say, our nature&mdash; specially received all those specially admirable gifts, and any others that may most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> be said to be peculiar to Him, by virtue of no preceding merits of its own. Let a man here answer to God if he dare, and say, Why was it not I also? And if he should hear, <q>O man, who are you that repliest against God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153510"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;9:10</a></span> let him not at this point restrain himself, but increase his impudence and say, <q>How is it that I hear, Who are you, O man? Since I am what I hear&mdash;that is, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and He of whom I speak is but the same? Why should not I also be what He is? For it is by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that He is such and so great; why is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> different when nature is common? Assuredly, there is no respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> I say, not what <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man, but what madman will say this?</p>

<h2>Chapter 31.&mdash; Christ Predestinated to Be the Son of God.</h2>

<p>Therefore in Him who is our Head let there appear to be the very fountain of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whence, according to the measure of every man, He diffuses Himself through all His members. It is by that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that every man from the beginning of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> becomes a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that one man from His beginning became Christ. Of the same Spirit also the former is born again of which the latter was born. By the same Spirit is effected in us the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, by which Spirit it was effected that He should have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. God certainly foreknew that He would do these things. This, therefore, is that same <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> which most especially shone forth in the Saint of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; and who is there of those who rightly understand the declarations of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that can deny this <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>? For we have learned that the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> Himself was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> in so far as the man was made the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. The teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> exclaims, in the beginning of his epistles, <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, a servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, called to be an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, separated unto the gospel of God (which He had promised afore by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>) concerning His Son, which was made of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh, who was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in power, according to the Spirit of sanctification by the resurrection of the dead.</q>  Therefore Jesus was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, so that He who was to be the Son of David according to the flesh should yet be in power the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, according to the Spirit of sanctification, because He was born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and of the Virgin Mary. This is that ineffably accomplished sole taking up of man by <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, so that He might <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and properly be called at the same time the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>&mdash;<a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> on account of the man taken up, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> on account of the God only-begotten who took Him up, so that a Trinity and not a Quaternity might be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in. Such a transporting of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, so great, so lofty, and so sublime that there was no exalting it more highly&mdash;just as on our behalf that divinity had no possibility of more humbly putting itself off, than by the assumption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> nature with the weakness of the flesh, even to the death of the cross. As, therefore, that one man was <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be our Head, so we being many are <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be His members. Here let <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> merits which have perished through <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> keep silence, and let that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God reign which reigns through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, the only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the one Lord. Let whoever can find in our Head the merits which preceded that peculiar generation, seek in us His members for those merits which preceded our manifold regeneration. For that generation was not recompensed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but given; that He should be born, namely, of the Spirit and the Virgin, separate from all entanglement of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Thus also our being born again of water and the Spirit is not recompensed to us for any merit, but freely given; and if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has brought us to the laver of regeneration, we ought not therefore to suppose that we have first given anything, so that the regeneration of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> should be recompensed to us again; because He made us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who made for us a Christ on whom we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. He makes in men the beginning and the completion of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Jesus who made the man Jesus the beginner and finisher of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note153512"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse2">Hebrews&nbsp;12:2</a></span> for thus, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, He is called in the epistle which is addressed to the Hebrews.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32 [XVI.]&mdash; The Twofold Calling.</h2>

<p>God indeed calls many <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> children of His, to make them members of His only <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> Son,&mdash; not with that calling with which they were called who would not come to the marriage, since with that calling were called also the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, to whom Christ crucified is an offense, and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, to whom Christ crucified is foolishness; but with that calling He calls the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> which the apostle distinguished when he said that he preached Christ, the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to them that were called, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as well as Greeks. For thus he says <q>But unto them which are called,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153513"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> in order to show that there were some who were not called; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that there is a certain sure calling of those who are called according to God's purpose, whom He has foreknown and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> before to be conformed to the image of His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. And it was this calling he meant when he said, <q>Not of works, but of Him that calls; it was said unto her, That the elder shall serve the younger.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153514"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;9:12</a></span> Did he say, <q>Not of works, but of him that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a></q>? Rather, he actually took this away from man, that he might give the whole to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore he said, <q>But of Him that calls,</q>&mdash; not with any sort of calling whatever, but with that calling wherewith a man is made a believer.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33.&mdash; It is in the Power of Evil Men to Sin; But to Do This or That by Means of that Wickedness is in God's Power Alone.</h2>

<p>Moreover, it was this that he had in view when he said, <q>The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153515"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;11:29</a></span> And in that saying also consider for a little what was its purport. For when he had said, <q>For I would not, brethren, that you should be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, that you may not be wise in yourselves, that blindness in part is happened to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, until the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> be come in, and so all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> should be saved; as it is written, There shall come out of Sion one who shall deliver, and turn away impiety from Jacob: and this is the covenant to them from me, when I shall take away their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>;</q>  he immediately added, what is to be very carefully understood, <q>As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sakes: but as concerning the election, they are beloved for their fathers' sakes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153517"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;11:28</a></span> What is the meaning of, <q>as concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sake,</q> but that their enmity wherewith they put Christ to death was, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, as we see, an advantage to the gospel? And he shows that this came about by God's ordering, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to make a good use even of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things; not that the vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> might be of advantage to Him, but that by His own good use of them they might be of advantage to the vessels of mercy. For what could be said more plainly than what is actually said, <q>As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sakes</q>? It is, therefore, in the power of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but that in sinning they should do this or that by that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is not in their power, but in God's, who divides the darkness and regulates it; so that hence even what they do contrary to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is not fulfilled except it be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. We read in the Acts of the Apostles that when the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had been sent away by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and had come to their own friends, and shown them what great things the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and elders said to them, they all with one consent lifted up their voices to the Lord and said, <q>Lord, you are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein; who, by the mouth of our father David, your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> servant, hast said, Why did the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> rage, and the peoples <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes were gathered together against the Lord, and against His Christ. For in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, there have assembled together in this city against Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> child Jesus, whom You have anointed, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to do whatever Your hand and counsel <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be done.</q>  See what is said: <q>As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for your sakes.</q> Because God's hand and counsel <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> such things to be done by the hostile <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as were necessary for the gospel, for our sakes. But what is it that follows? <q>But as concerning the election, they are beloved for their fathers' sakes.</q> For are those enemies who perished in their enmity and those of the same people who still perish in their opposition to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>&mdash;are those chosen and beloved? Away with the thought! Who is so utterly foolish as to say this? But both expressions, although contrary to one another&mdash; that is, <q>enemies</q> and <q>beloved</q>&mdash; are appropriate, though not to the same men, yet to the same Jewish people, and to the same carnal seed of lsrael, of whom some belonged to the falling away, and some to the blessing of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> himself. For the apostle previously explained this meaning more clearly when he said, <q>That which lsrael wrought for, he has not obtained; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153519"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;11:7</a></span> Yet in both cases it was the very same <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Where, therefore, we hear, <q><a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has not obtained,</q> or, <q>The rest were blinded,</q> there are to be understood the enemies for our sakes; but where we hear, <q>that the election has obtained it,</q> there are to be understood the beloved for their father's sakes, to which fathers those things were assuredly promised; because <q>the promises were made to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and his seed,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153520"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse16">Galatians&nbsp;3:16</a></span> whence also in that olive-tree is grafted the wild olive-tree of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Now subsequently we certainly ought to fall in with the election, of which he says that it is according to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not according to debt, because <q>there was made a remnant by the election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note153521"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;11:5</a></span> This election obtained it, the rest being blinded. As concerning this election, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> were beloved for the sake of their fathers. For they were not called with that calling of which it is said, <q>Many are called,</q> but with that whereby the chosen are called. Whence also after he had said, <q>But as concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes,</q> he went on to add those words whence this discussion arose: <q>For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance,</q>&mdash; that is, they are firmly established without change. Those who belong to this calling are all teachable by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor can any of them say, <q>I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in order to being thus called,</q> because the mercy of God anticipated him, because he was so called in order that he might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For all who are teachable of God come to the Son because they have heard and learned from the Father through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who most clearly says, <q>Every one who has heard of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and has learned, comes unto me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153522"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse45">John&nbsp;6:45</a></span> But of such as these none perishes, because <q>of all that the Father has given Him, He will lose none.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153523"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;6:39</a></span> Whoever, therefore, is of these does not perish at all; nor was any who perishes ever of these. For which reason it is said, <q>They went out from among us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would certainly have continued with us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153524"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;2:19</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 34 [XVII.]&mdash; The Special Calling of the Elect is Not Because They Have Believed, But in Order that They May Believe.</h2>

<p>Let us, then, understand the calling whereby they become elected,&mdash; not those who are elected because they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but who are elected that they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For the Lord Himself also sufficiently explains this calling when He says, <q>You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153525"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;15:16</a></span> For if they had been elected because they had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, they themselves would certainly have first chosen Him by believing in Him, so that they should deserve to be elected. But He takes away this supposition altogether when He says, <q>You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.</q> And yet they themselves, beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, chose Him when they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him. Whence it is not for any other reason that He says, <q>You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,</q> than because they did not choose Him that He should choose them, but He chose them that they might choose Him; because His mercy preceded them according to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not according to debt. Therefore He chose them out of the world while He was wearing flesh, but as those who were already chosen in Himself before the foundation of the world. This is the changeless <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For what is it that the apostle says, <q>As He has chosen us in Himself before the foundation of the world</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note153526"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse4">Ephesians&nbsp;1:4</a></span> And assuredly, if this were said because God foreknew that they would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, not because He Himself would make them <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, the Son is speaking against such a foreknowledge as that when He says, <q>You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you;</q> when God should rather have foreknown this very thing, that they themselves would have chosen Him, so that they might deserve to be chosen by Him. Therefore they were elected before the foundation of the world with that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreknew what He Himself would do; but they were elected out of the world with that calling whereby God fulfilled that which He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>. For whom He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, them He also called, with that calling, to wit, which is according to the purpose. Not others, therefore, but those whom He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, them He also called; nor others, but those whom He so called, them He also justified; nor others, but those whom He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, called, and justified, them He also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>; assuredly to that end which has no end. Therefore God elected <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>; but He chose them that they might be so, not because they were already so. The Apostle James says: <q>Has not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and heirs of the kingdom which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has promised to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153527"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse5">James&nbsp;2:5</a></span> By choosing them, therefore; He makes them rich in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as He makes them heirs of the kingdom; because He is rightly said to choose that in them, in order to make which in them He chose them. I ask, who can hear the Lord saying, <q>You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,</q> and can dare to say that men <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in order to be elected, when they are rather elected to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; lest against the judgment of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they be found to have first chosen Christ to whom Christ says, <q>You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note153528"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;16:16</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 35 [XVIII.]&mdash; Election is for the Purpose of Holiness.</h2>

<p>Who can hear the apostle saying, <q>Blessed be the God and Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who has blessed us in all spiritual blessing in the heavens in Christ; as He has chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and without spot in His sight; in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a> us to the adoption of children by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to Himself according to the good pleasure of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, wherein He has shown us favour in His beloved Son; in whom we have redemption through His blood, the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> according to the riches of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which has abounded to us in all wisdom and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; that He might show to us the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> according to His good pleasure, which He has purposed in Himself, in the dispensation of the fullness of times, to restore all things in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which are in heaven, and in the earth, in Him: in whom also we have obtained a share, being <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> according to the purpose; who works all things according to the counsel of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, that we should be to the praise of his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>;</q> &mdash; who, I say, can hear these words with attention and intelligence, and can venture to have any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> so clear as this which we are defending? God chose Christ's members in Him before the foundation of the world; and how should He choose those who as yet did not exist, except by <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a> them? Therefore He chose us by <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a> us. Would he choose the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> and the unclean? Now if the question be proposed, whether He would choose such, or rather the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and unstained, who can ask which of these he may answer, and not give his opinion at once in favour of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and pure?</p>

<h2>Chapter 36.&mdash; God Chose the Righteous; Not Those Whom He Foresaw as Being of Themselves, But Those Whom He Predestinated for the Purpose of Making So.</h2>

<p><q>Therefore,</q> says the Pelagian, <q>He foreknew who would be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and immaculate by the choice of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, and on that account elected them before the foundation of the world in that same foreknowledge of His in which He foreknew that they would be such. Therefore He elected them,</q> says he, <q>before they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a> them to be children whom He foreknew to be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and immaculate. Certainly He did not make them so; nor did He foresee that He would make them so, but that they would be so.</q> Let us, then, look into the words of the apostle and see whether He chose us before the foundation of the world because we were going to be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and immaculate, or in order that we might be so. <q>Blessed,</q> says he, <q>be the God and Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who has blessed us in all spiritual blessing in the heavens in Christ; even as He has chosen us in Himself before the foundation of the world, that we should be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and unspotted.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153530"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;1:3</a></span> Not, then, because we were to be so, but that we might be so. Assuredly it is certain,&mdash; assuredly it is manifest. Certainly we were to be such for the reason that He has chosen us, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a> us to be such by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore He blessed us with spiritual blessing in the heavens in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and immaculate in His sight, in order that we might not in so great a benefit of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> concerning the good pleasure of our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. <q>In which,</q> says he, <q>He has shown us favour in His beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,</q>&mdash; in which, certainly, His own will, He has shown us favour. Thus, it is said, He has shown us <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, even as it is said, He has made us righteous by righteousness. <q>In whom,</q> he says, <q>we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to the riches of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which has abounded to us in all wisdom and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; that he might show to us the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, according to His good pleasure.</q> In this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, He placed the riches of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to His good pleasure, not according to ours, which could not possibly be good unless He Himself, according to His own good pleasure, should aid it to become so. But when he had said, <q>According to His good pleasure,</q> he added, <q>which He purposed in Him,</q> that is, in His beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <q>in the dispensation of the fullness of times to restore all things in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which are in heaven, and which are in earth, in Him: in whom also we too have obtained a lot, being <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> according to His purpose who works all things according to the counsel of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; that we should be to the praise of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 37.&mdash; We Were Elected and Predestinated, Not Because We Were Going to Be Holy, But in Order that We Might Be So.</h2>

<p>It would be too tedious to argue about the several points. But you see without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, you see with what evidence of apostolic declaration this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is defended, in opposition to which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> merits are set up, as if man should first give something for it to be recompensed to him again. Therefore God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a> us to the adoption of children, not because we were going to be of ourselves <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and immaculate, but He chose and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> us that we might be so. Moreover, He did this according to the good pleasure of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, so that nobody might <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> concerning his own will, but about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> towards himself. He did this according to the riches of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to His good-will, which He purposed in His beloved Son; in whom we have obtained a share, being <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> according to the purpose, not ours, but His, who works all things to such an extent as that He works in us to will also. Moreover, He works according to the counsel of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, that we may be to the praise of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note153531"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;2:13</a></span> For this reason it is that we cry that no one should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in man, and, thus, not in himself; but whoever <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> let him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, that he may be for the praise of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Because He Himself works according to His purpose that we may be to the praise of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and, of course, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and immaculate, for which purpose He called us, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a> us before the foundation of the world. Out of this, His purpose, is that special calling of the elect for whom He co-works with all things for good, because they are called according to His purpose, and <q>the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153532"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;11:29</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 38 [XIX.]&mdash; What is the View of the Pelagians, and What of the Semi-<a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, Concerning Predestination.</h2>

<p>But these brethren of ours, about whom and on whose behalf we are now discoursing, say, perhaps, that the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> are refuted by this <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> testimony in which it is said that we are chosen in Christ and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> before the foundation of the world, in order that we should be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and immaculate in His sight in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For they think that <q>having received God's commands we are of ourselves by the choice of our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and immaculate in His sight in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; and since God foresaw that this would be the case,</q> they say, <q>He therefore chose and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> us in Christ before the foundation of the world.</q> Although the apostle says that it was not because He foreknew that we should be such, but in order that we might be such by the same election of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, by which He showed us favour in His beloved Son. When, therefore, He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> us, He foreknew His own work by which He makes us <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and immaculate. Whence the Pelagian <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is rightly refuted by this testimony. <q>But we say,</q> say they, <q>that God did not foreknow anything as ours except that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by which we begin to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and that He chose and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> us before the foundation of the world, in order that we might be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and immaculate by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and by His work.</q> But let them also hear in this testimony the words where he says, <q>We have obtained a lot, being <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> according to His purpose who works all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153533"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse11">Ephesians&nbsp;1:11</a></span> He, therefore, works the beginning of our belief who works all things; because <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself does not precede that calling of which it is said: <q>For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153534"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;11:29</a></span> and of which it is said: <q>Not of works, but of Him that calls</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153535"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;9:12</a></span> (although He might have said, <q>of Him that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a></q>); and the election which the Lord signified when He said: <q>You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153536"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;15:16</a></span> For He chose us, not because we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but that we might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, lest we should be said first to have chosen Him, and so His word be false (which be it far from us to think possible), <q>You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.</q> Neither are we called because we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but that we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; and by that calling which is without repentance it is effected and carried through that we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. But all the many things which we have said concerning this matter need not to be repeated.</p>

<h2>Chapter 39&mdash; The Beginning of Faith is God's Gift.</h2>

<p>Finally, also, in what follows this testimony, the apostle gives thanks to God on behalf of those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>&mdash;not, certainly, because the gospel has been declared to them, but because they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. For he says, <q>In whom also after ye had heard the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the gospel of your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; in whom also, after that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, you were sealed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of promise, which is the pledge of our inheritance, to the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Wherefore I also, after I had heard of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Christ Jesus and with reference to all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, cease not to give thanks for you.</q>  Their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was new and recent on the preaching of the gospel to them, which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> when he hears of, the apostle gives thanks to God on their behalf. If he were to give thanks to man for that which he might either think or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that man had not given, it would be called a flattery or a mockery, rather than a giving of thanks. <q>Do not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, for God is not mocked;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153538"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse7">Galatians&nbsp;6:7</a></span> for His gift is also the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, unless the apostolic giving of thanks be rightly judged to be either mistaken or fallacious. What then? Does that not appear as the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Thessalonians, for which, nevertheless, the same apostle gives thanks to God when he says, <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also we thank God without ceasing, because when you had received from us the word of the hearing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you received it not as the word of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but as it is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which effectually works in you and which you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a></q>? <span class="stiki" id="note153539"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:13</a></span> What is that for which he here gives thanks to God? Assuredly it is a vain and idle thing if He to whom he gives thanks did not Himself do the thing. But, since this is not a vain and idle thing, certainly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom he gave thanks concerning this work, Himself did it; that when they had received the word of the hearing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they received it not as the word of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but as it is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, works in the hearts of men with that calling according to His purpose, of which we have spoken a great deal, that they should not hear the gospel in vain, but when they heard it, should be converted and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, receiving it not as the word of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but as it is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40 [XX.]&mdash; Apostolic Testimony to the Beginning of Faith Being God's Gift.</h2>

<p>Moreover, we are admonished that the beginning of men's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is God's gift, since the apostle signifies this when, in the Epistle to the Colossians, he says, <q>Continue in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and watch in the same in giving of thanks. Withal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> also for us that God would open unto us the door of His word, to speak the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for which also I am in bonds, that I may so make it manifest as I ought to speak.</q>  How is the door of His word opened, except when the sense of the hearer is opened so that he may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and, having made a beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, may admit those things which are declared and reasoned, for the purpose of building up wholesome doctrine, lest, by a heart closed through unbelief, he reject and repel those things which are spoken? Whence, also, he says to the Corinthians: <q>But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. For a great and evident door is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153541"><a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;16:8</a></span> What else can be understood here, save that, when the gospel had been first of all preached there by him, many had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and there had appeared many adversaries of the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in accordance with that saying of the Lord, <q>No one comes unto me, unless it were given him of my Father;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153542"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse66">John&nbsp;6:66</a></span> and, <q>To you it is given to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, but to them it is not given</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note153543"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;8:10</a></span> Therefore, there is an open door in those to whom it is given, but there are many adversaries among those to whom it is not given.</p>

<h2>Chapter 41.&mdash; Further Apostolic Testimonies.</h2>

<p>And again, the same apostle says to the same people, in his second Epistle: <q>When I had come to <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a> for the gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and a door had been opened unto me in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus, my brother: but, making my farewell to them, I went away into Macedonia.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153544"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:12-13</a></span> To whom did he bid farewell but to those who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>&mdash;to wit, in whose hearts the door was opened for his preaching of the gospel? But attend to what he adds, saying, <q>Now thanks be unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who always causes us to triumph in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and makes manifest the savour of His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by us in every place: because we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them who are saved, and in them who perish: to some, indeed, we are the savour of death unto death, but to some the savour of life unto life.</q>  See concerning what this most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> soldier and invincible defender of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> gives thanks. See concerning what he gives thanks&mdash;that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> are a sweet savour of Christ unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both in those who are saved by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and in those who perish by His judgment. But in order that those who little understand these things may be less enraged, he himself gives a warning when he adds the words: <q>And who is sufficient for these things?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153546"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:16</a></span> But let us return to the opening of the door by which the apostle signified the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in his hearers. For what is the meaning of, <q>Withal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> also for us that God would open unto us a door of the word,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153547"><a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse3">Colossians&nbsp;4:3</a></span> unless it is a most manifest demonstration that even the very beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the gift of God? For it would not be sought for from Him in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, unless it were <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be given by Him. This gift of heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> had descended to that seller of purple <span class="stiki" id="note153548"><a href="../bible/act016.htm#verse14">Acts&nbsp;16:14</a></span> for whom, as <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says in the Acts of the Apostles, <q>The Lord opened her heart, and she gave heed unto the things which were said by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>;</q> for she was so called that she might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Because God does what He will in the hearts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, either by assistance or by judgment; so that, even through their means, may be fulfilled what His hand and counsel have <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be done.</p>

<h2>Chapter 42.&mdash; Old Testament Testimonies.</h2>

<p>Therefore also it is in vain that objectors have alleged, that what we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by Scripture testimony from the books of Kings and Chronicles is not pertinent to the subject of which we are discoursing:  such, for instance, as that when God wills that to be done which ought only to be done by the willing men, their hearts are inclined to will this&mdash;inclined, that is to say, by His power, who, in a marvellous and ineffable manner, works in us also to will. What else is this than to say nothing, and yet to contradict? Unless perchance, they have given some reason to you for the view that they have taken, which reason you have preferred to say nothing about in your letters. But what that reason can be I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Whether, possibly, since we have shown that God has so acted on the hearts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and has induced the wills of those whom He pleased to this point, that Saul or David should be established as king&mdash;do they not think that these instances are appropriate to this subject, because to reign in this world temporally is not the same thing as to reign <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> with God? And so do they suppose that God inclines the wills of those whom He pleases to the attainment of earthly kingdoms, but does not incline them to the attainment of a heavenly kingdom? But I think that it was in reference to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and not to an earthly kingdom, that it was said, <q>Incline my heart unto Your testimonies;</q>  or, <q>The steps of a man are ordered by the Lord, and He will will His way;</q>  or, <q>The will is prepared by the Lord;</q>  or, <q>Let our Lord be with us as with our fathers; let Him not forsake us, nor turn Himself away from us; let Him incline our hearts unto Him, that we may walk in all His ways;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153553"><a href="../bible/1ki008.htm#verse57">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;8:57</a></span> or, <q>I will give them a heart to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me, and ears that hear;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153554"><a href="../bible/bar002.htm#verse31">Baruch&nbsp;2:31</a></span> or, <q>I will give them another heart, and a new spirit will I give them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153555"><a href="../bible/eze011.htm#verse19">Ezekiel&nbsp;11:19</a></span> Let them also hear this, <q>I will give my Spirit within you, and I will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to walk in my righteousness; and you shall observe my judgments, and do them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153556"><a href="../bible/eze036.htm#verse27">Ezekiel&nbsp;36:27</a></span> Let them hear, <q>Man's goings are directed by the Lord, and how can a man understand His ways?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153557"><a href="../bible/pro020.htm#verse24">Proverbs&nbsp;20:24</a></span> Let them hear, <q>Every man seems right to himself, but the Lord directs the hearts.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153558"><a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse2">Proverbs&nbsp;21:2</a></span> Let them hear, <q>As many as were ordained to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life believed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153559"><a href="../bible/act013.htm#verse48">Acts&nbsp;13:48</a></span> Let them hear these passages, and whatever others of the kind I have not mentioned in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is declared to prepare and to convert men's wills, even for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> and for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. And consider what sort of a thing it is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God works men's wills for the foundation of earthly kingdoms, but that men work their own wills for the attainment of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 43 [XXI.]&mdash; Conclusion.</h2>

<p>I have said a great deal, and, perchance, I could long ago have persuaded you what I wished, and am still speaking this to such intelligent minds as if they were obtuse, to whom even what is too much is not enough. But let them pardon me, for a new question has compelled me to this. Because, although in my former little treatises I had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by sufficiently appropriate <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> also was the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there was found this ground of contradiction, viz., that those testimonies were good for this purpose, to show that the increase of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was God's gift, but that the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereby a man first of all believes in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is of the man himself, and is not the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;but that God requires this, so that when it has preceded, other gifts may follow, as it were on the ground of this merit, and these are the gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and that none of them is given freely, although in them God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is declared, which is not <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> except as being gratuitous. And you see how absurd all this is. Wherefore I determined, as far as I could, to set forth that this very beginning also is God's gift. And if I have done this at a greater length than perhaps those on whose account I did it might wish, I am prepared to be reproached for it by them, so long as they nevertheless confess that, although at greater length than they wished, although with the disgust and weariness of those that understand, I have done what I have done: that is, I have taught that even the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as continence, patience, righteousness, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and the rest, concerning which there is no dispute with them, is God's gift. Let this, therefore, be the end of this treatise, lest too great length in this one may give offense.</p>
