<h1>On the Predestination of the Saints (Book II)</h1>

<p> <em>In the first part of the book he proves that the perseverance by which a man perseveres in Christ to the end is God's gift; for that it is a mockery to ask of God that which is not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Moreover, that in the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a> scarcely anything is asked for but perseverance, according to the exposition of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Cyprian, by which exposition the enemies to this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> were convicted before they were born. He teaches that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of perseverance is not given according to the merits of the receivers, but to some it is given by God's mercy; to others it is not given, by His righteous judgment. That it is inscrutable why, of adults, one rather than another should be called; just as, moreover, of two infants it is inscrutable why the one should be taken, the other left. But that it is still more inscrutable why, of two <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, to one it should be given to persevere, to the other it should not be given; but that this is most certain, that the former is of the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, the latter is not. He observes that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is set forth in our Lord's words concerning the people of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Sidon, who would have repented if the same <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> had been done among them which had been done in Chorazin. He shows that the case of infants is of force to confirm the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in older people; and he answers the passage of his third book on <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, unsoundly alleged on this point by his adversaries. Subsequently, in the second part of this work, he rebuts what they say&mdash;to wit, that the definition of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is opposed to the usefulness of exhortation and rebuke. He asserts, on the other hand, that it is advantageous to preach <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, so that man may not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in himself, but in the Lord. As to the objections, how</em> <em>ever, which they make against <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, he shows that the same objections may be twisted in no unlike manner either against God's foreknowledge or against that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which they all agree to be necessary for other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things (with the exception of the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the completion of perseverance). For that the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is nothing else than God's foreknowledge and preparation for His benefits, by which whoever are delivered are most certainly delivered. But he bids that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> should be preached in a harmonious manner, and not in such a way as to seem to an unskilful multitude as if it were disproved by its very preaching. Lastly, he commends to us <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, as placed before our eyes, as the most eminent instance of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1 [I.]&mdash; Of the Nature of the Perseverance Here Discoursed of.</h2>

<p>I Have now to consider the subject of perseverance with greater care; for in the former book also I said some things on this subject when I was discussing the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. I assert, therefore, that the perseverance by which we persevere in Christ even to the end is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and I call that the end by which is finished that life wherein alone there is peril of falling. Therefore it is uncertain whether any one has received this gift so long as he is still alive. For if he fall before he dies, he is, of course, said not to have persevered; and most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is it said. How, then, should he be said to have received or to have had perseverance who has not persevered? For if any one have continence, and fall away from that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and become incontinent&mdash;or, in like manner, if he have righteousness, if patience, if even <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and fall away, he is rightly said to have had these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and to have them no longer; for he was continent, or he was righteous, or he was patient, or he was believing, as long as he was so; but when he ceased to be so, he no longer is what he was. But how should he who has not persevered have ever been persevering, since it is only by persevering that any one shows himself persevering&mdash;and this he has not done? But lest any one should object to this, and say, If from the time at which any one became a believer he has lived&mdash; for the sake of argument&mdash; ten years, and in the midst of them has fallen from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, has he not persevered for five years? I am not contending about words. If it be thought that this also should be called perseverance, as it were for so long as it lasts, assuredly he is not to be said to have had in any degree that perseverance of which we are now discoursing, by which one perseveres in Christ even to the end. And the believer of one year, or of a period as much shorter as may be conceived of, if he has lived faithfully until he died, has rather had this perseverance than the believer of many years' standing, if a little time before his death he has fallen away from the steadfastness of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2 [II.]&mdash; Faith is the Beginning of a Christian Man. Martyrdom for Christ's Sake is His Best Ending.</h2>

<p>This matter being settled, let us see whether this perseverance, of which it was said, <q>He that perseveres unto the end, the same shall be saved,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153561"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;10:22</a></span> is a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And if it be not, how is that saying of the apostle <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: <q>Unto you it is given in the behalf of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not only to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, but also to suffer for His sake</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note153562"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse29">Philippians&nbsp;2:29</a></span> Of these things, certainly, one has respect to the beginning, the other to the end. Yet each is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because both are said to be given; as, also, I have already said above. For what is more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the beginning for a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> than to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ? What end is better than to suffer for Christ? But so far as pertains to believing in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whatever kind of contradiction has been discovered, that not the beginning but the increase of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should be called God's gift,&mdash; to this opinion, by God's gift, I have answered enough, and more than enough. But what reason can be given why perseverance to the end should not be given in Christ to him to whom it is given to suffer for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or, to speak more distinctly, to whom it is given to die for Christ? For the Apostle Peter, showing that this is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, says, <q>It is better, if the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be so, to suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153563"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:17</a></span> When he says, <q>If the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be so,</q> he shows that this is divinely given, and yet not to all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, to suffer for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake. For certainly those whom the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not will to attain to the experience and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of suffering, do not fail to attain to the kingdom of God if they persevere in Christ to the end. But who can say that this perseverance is not given to those who die in Christ from any weakness of body, or by any kind of accident, although a far more difficult perseverance is given to those by whom even death itself is undergone for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake? Because perseverance is much more difficult when the persecutor is engaged in preventing a man's perseverance; and therefore he is sustained in his perseverance unto death. Hence it is more difficult to have the former perseverance,&mdash; easier to have the latter; but to Him to whom nothing is difficult it is easy to give both. For God has promised this, saying, <q>I will put my <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153564"><a href="../bible/jer032.htm#verse40">Jeremiah&nbsp;32:40</a></span> And what else is this than, <q>Such and so great shall be my <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that I will put into their hearts that they will perseveringly cleave to me</q>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; God is Besought for It, Because It is His Gift.</h2>

<p>But why is that perseverance asked for from God if it is not given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? Is that, too, a mocking petition, when that is asked from Him which it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that He does not give, but, though He gives it not, is in man's power; just as that giving of thanks is a mockery, if thanks are given to God for that which He did not give nor do? But what I have said there,  I say also here again: <q>Be not deceived,</q> says the apostle, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not mocked.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153566"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;6:6</a></span> O man, God is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> not only of your words, but also of your thoughts. If you ask anything in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of one who is so rich, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you receive from Him from whom you ask, what you ask. Abstain from honouring Him with your lips and extolling yourself over Him in your heart, by believing that you have from yourself what you are pretending to beseech from Him. Is not this perseverance, perchance, asked for from Him? He who says this is not to be rebuked by any arguments, but must be overwhelmed  with the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Is there any of these who does not ask for himself from God that he may persevere in Him, when in that very <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which is called the Lord's&mdash; because the Lord taught it&mdash; when it is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, scarcely anything else is understood to be <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for but perseverance?</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; Three Leading Points of the Pelagian Doctrine.</h2>

<p>Read with a little more attention its exposition in the treatise of the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Cyprian, which he wrote concerning this matter, the title of which is, <em>On the Lord's Prayer</em>; and see how many years ago, and what sort of an antidote was prepared against those poisons which the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> were one day to use. For there are three points, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, which the catholic Church chiefly maintains against them. One of these is, that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is not given according to our merits; because even every one of the merits of the righteous is God's gift, and is conferred by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. The second is, that no one lives in this corruptible body, however righteous he may be, without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of some kind. The third is, that man is born obnoxious to the first man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and bound by the chain of condemnation, unless the guilt which is contracted by generation be loosed by regeneration. Of these three points, that which I have placed last is the only one that is not treated of in the above-named book of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; but of the two others the discourse there is of such perspicuity, that the above-named <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, modern enemies of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are found to have been convicted long before they were born. Among these merits of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, then, which are no merits unless they are the gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he says that perseverance also is God's gift, in these words: <q>We say, 'Hallowed be Your name;' not that we ask for God that He may be hallowed by our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, but that we beseech of Him that His name may be hallowed in us. But by whom is God sanctified, since He Himself sanctifies? Well, because He says, Be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> because I also am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, we ask and entreat that we, who were sanctified in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, may persevere in that which we have begun to be.</q>  And a little after, still arguing about that self-same matter, and teaching that we entreat perseverance from the Lord, which we could in no wise rightly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> do unless it were His gift, he says: <q>We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that this sanctification may abide in us; and because our Lord and Judge warns the man that was healed and quickened by Him to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more, lest a worse thing happen unto him, we make this supplication in our constant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; we ask this, day and night, that the sanctification and quickening which is received from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God may be preserved by His protection.</q>  That teacher, therefore, understands that we are asking from Him for perseverance in sanctification, that is, that we should persevere in sanctification, when we who are sanctified say, <q>Hallowed be Your name.</q> For what else is it to ask for what we have already received, than that it be given to us also not to cease from its possession? As, therefore, the saint, when he asks God that he may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, is certainly asking that he may continue to be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, so certainly the chaste person also, when he asks that he may be chaste, the continent that he may be continent, the righteous that he may be righteous, the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> that he may be <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and the like&mdash;which things, against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, we maintain to be God's gifts,&mdash; are asking, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that they may persevere in those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which they have acknowledged that they have received. And if they receive this, assuredly they also receive perseverance itself, the great gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby His other gifts are preserved.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; The Second Petition in the Lord's Prayer.</h2>

<p>What, when we say, <q>Your kingdom come,</q> do we ask else, but that that should also come to us which we do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> will come to all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>? And therefore here also, what do they who are already <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for, save that they may persevere in that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> which has been given them? For no otherwise will the kingdom of God come to them; which it is certain will come not to others, but to those who persevere to the end.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6 [III.]&mdash; The Third Petition. How Heaven and Earth are Understood in the Lord's Prayer.</h2>

<p>The third petition is, <q>Your will be done in heaven and in earth;</q> or, as it is read in many codices, and is more frequently made use of by petitioners, <q>As in heaven, so also in earth,</q> which many people understand, <q>As the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, so also may we do your will.</q> That teacher and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> will have heaven and earth, however, to be understood as spirit and flesh, and says that we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that we may do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with the full concord of both. He saw in these words also another meaning, congruous to the soundest <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of which meaning I have already spoken above&mdash;to wit, that for unbelievers, who are as yet <em>earth</em>, bearing in their first birth only the earthly man, <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> are understood to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, who, being clothed with the heavenly man, are not unreasonably called by the name of <em> heaven</em>; where he plainly shows that the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> also is God's gift, since the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> not only for <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be increased or may continue in them, but, moreover, for unbelievers, that they may begin to have what they have not had at all, and against which, besides, they were indulging hostile feelings. Now, however, I am arguing not concerning the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of which I have already spoken much in the former book, but of that perseverance which must be had even to the end&mdash;which assuredly even the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, who do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seek when they say in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>Your will be done.</q> For, since it is already done in them, why do they still ask that it may be done, except that they may persevere in that which they have begun to be? Nevertheless, it may here be said that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> do not ask that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may be done in heaven, but that it may be done in earth as in heaven,&mdash; that is to say, that earth may imitate heaven, that is, that man may imitate the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, or that an unbeliever may imitate a believer; and thus that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are asking that that may be which is not yet, not that that which is may continue. For, by whatever <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> men may be distinguished, they are not yet equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not yet, therefore, is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> done in them as it is in heaven. And if this be so, in that portion indeed in which we ask that men from unbelievers may become <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, it is not perseverance, but beginning, that seems to be asked for; but in that in which we ask that men may be made equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in doing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>&mdash;where the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for this, they are found to be <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for perseverance; since no one attains to that highest blessedness which is in the kingdom, unless he shall persevere unto the end in that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> which he has received on earth.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7 [IV.]&mdash; The Fourth Petition.</h2>

<p>The fourth petition is, <q>Give us this day our daily bread,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153570"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;6:11</a></span> where the blessed Cyprian shows how here also perseverance is understood to be asked for. Because he says, among other things, <q>And we ask that this bread should be given to us daily, that we who are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and daily receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> for the food of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, may not by the interposition of some heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be separated from Christ's body by being withheld from communicating and prevented from partaking of the heavenly bread.</q>  These words of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man of God indicate that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> ask for perseverance directly from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when with this intention they say, <q>Give us this day our daily bread,</q> that they may not be separated from Christ's body, but may continue in that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in which they allow no crime by which they may deserve to be separated from it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8 [V.]&mdash; The Fifth Petition. It is an Error of the Pelagians that the Righteous are Free from Sin.</h2>

<p>In the fifth sentence of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> we say, <q>Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153572"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> in which petition alone perseverance is not found to be asked for. For the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which we ask to be forgiven us are past, but perseverance, which saves us for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, is indeed necessary for the time of this life; but not for the time which is past, but for that which remains even to its end. Yet it is worth the labour to consider for a little, how even already in this petition the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who were to arise long after were transfixed by the tongue of Cyprian, as if by the most invincible dart of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> dare to say even this: that the righteous  man in this life has no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all, and that in such men there is even at the present time a Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, <span class="stiki" id="note153573"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse27">Ephesians&nbsp;5:27</a></span> which is the one and only bride of Christ; as if she were not His bride who throughout the whole earth says what she has learned from Him, <q>Forgive us our debts.</q> But observe how the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Cyprian destroys these. For when he was expounding that very clause of the Lord's Prayer, he says among other things: <q>And how necessarily, how providently, and salutarily are we admonished that we are sinners, since we are compelled to entreat for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and while pardon is asked for from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> recalls its own consciousness. Lest any one should flatter himself that he is innocent, and by exalting himself should more deeply perish, he is instructed and taught that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> daily, in that he is bidden daily to entreat for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Thus, moreover, John also in his Epistle warns  us, and says, <span class="stiki" id="note153575"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> 'If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.'</q>  And the rest, which it would be long to insert in this place.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; When Perseverance is Granted to a Person, He Cannot But Persevere.</h2>

<p>Now, moreover, when the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> say, <q>Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, but deliver us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153577"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;6:13</a></span> what do they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for but that they may persevere in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>? For, assuredly, when that gift of God is granted to them&mdash;which is sufficiently plainly shown to be God's gift, since it is asked of Him&mdash;that gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, being granted to them that they may not be led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, none of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> fails to keep his perseverance in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> even to the end. For there is not any one who ceases to persevere in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> purpose unless he is first of all led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. If, therefore, it be granted to him according to his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that he may not be led, certainly by the gift of God he persists in that sanctification which by the gift of God he has received.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10 [VI.]&mdash; The Gift of Perseverance Can Be Obtained by Prayer.</h2>

<p>But you write that <q>these brethren will not have this perseverance so preached as that it cannot be obtained by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> or lost by obstinacy.</q>  In this they are little careful in considering what they say. For we are speaking of that perseverance whereby one perseveres unto the end, and if this is given, one does persevere unto the end; but if one does not persevere unto the end, it is not given, which I have already sufficiently discussed above. Let not men say, then, that perseverance is given to any one to the end, except when the end itself has come, and he to whom it has been given has been found to have persevered unto the end. Certainly, we say that one whom we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be chaste is chaste, whether he should continue or not in the same <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; and if he should have any other divine endowment which may be kept and lost, we say that he has it as long as he has it; and if he should lose it, we say that he had it. But since no one has perseverance to the end except he who does persevere to the end, many people may have it, but none can lose it. For it is not to be feared that perchance when a man has persevered unto the end, some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will may arise in him, so that he does not persevere unto the end. This gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, may be obtained by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, but when it has been given, it cannot be lost by contumacy. For when any one has persevered unto the end, he neither can lose this gift, nor others which he could lose before the end. How, then, can that be lost, whereby it is brought about that even that which could be lost is not lost?</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; Effect of Prayer for Perseverance.</h2>

<p>But, lest perchance it be said that perseverance even to the end is not indeed lost when it has once been given&mdash;that is, when a man has persevered unto the end&mdash;but that it is lost, in some sense, when a man by contumacy so acts that he is not able to attain to it; just as we say that a man who has not persevered unto the end has lost <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life or the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, not because he had already received and actually had it, but because he would have received and had it if he had persevered;&mdash; let us lay aside controversies of words, and say that some things even which are not possessed, but are hoped to be possessed, may be lost. Let any one who dares, tell me whether God cannot give what He has commanded to be asked from Him. Certainly he who affirms this, I say not is a fool, but he is mad. But God commanded that His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> should say to Him in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q> Whoever, therefore, is heard when he asks this, is not led into the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of contumacy, whereby he could or would be worthy to lose perseverance in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; Of His Own Will a Man Forsakes God, So that He is Deservedly Forsaken of Him.</h2>

<p>But, on the other hand, <q>of his own will a man forsakes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so as to be deservedly forsaken by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Who would deny this? But it is for that reason we ask not to be led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, so that this may not happen. And if we are heard, certainly it does not happen, because God does not allow it to happen. For nothing comes to pass except what either He Himself does, or Himself allows to be done. Therefore He is powerful both to turn wills from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to good, and to convert those that are inclined to fall, or to direct them into a way pleasing to Himself. For to Him it is not said in vain, <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, You shall turn again and quicken us;</q>  it is not vainly said, <q>Give not my foot to be moved;</q>  it is not vainly said, <q>Give me not over, O Lord, from my desire to the sinner;</q>  finally, not to mention many passages, since probably more may occur to you, it is not vainly said, <q>Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153582"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;6:13</a></span> For whoever is not led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, certainly is not led into the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will; and he who is not led into the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will, is absolutely led into no <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. For <q>every one is tempted,</q> as it is written, <q>when he is drawn away of his own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and enticed;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153583"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse14">James&nbsp;1:14</a></span> <q>but God tempts no man,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153584"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse13">James&nbsp;1:13</a></span> &mdash; that is to say, with a hurtful <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> is moreover beneficial by which we are not deceived or overwhelmed, but <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, according to that which is said, <q>Prove me, O Lord, and try me.</q>  Therefore, with that hurtful <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> which the apostle signifies when he says, <q>Lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153586"><a href="../bible/1th003.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> tempts no man,</q> as I have said&mdash;that is, He brings or leads no one into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. For to be tempted and not to be led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>&mdash;nay, it is even good; for this it is to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. When, therefore, we say to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>,</q> what do we say but, <q>Permit us not to be led</q>? Whence some <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in this manner, and it is read in many codices, and the most blessed Cyprian thus uses it: <q>Do not suffer us to be led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q> In the Greek gospel, however, I have never found it otherwise than, <q>Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q> We live, therefore, more securely if we give up the whole to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and do not entrust ourselves partly to Him and partly to ourselves, as that venerable <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> saw. For when he would expound the same clause of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, he says among other things, <q>But when we ask that we may not come into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, we are reminded of our infirmity and weakness while we thus ask, lest any should insolently vaunt himself&mdash;lest any should proudly and arrogantly assume anything to himself&mdash;lest any should take to himself the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> either of confession or suffering as his own; since the Lord Himself, teaching humility, said, 'Watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, that you enter not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>; the Spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.' So that when a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and submissive confession comes first and all is attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whatever is sought for suppliantly, with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may be granted by His own loving-kindness.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 13 [VII.]&mdash; Temptation the Condition of Man.</h2>

<p>If, then, there were no other <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, this Lord's Prayer alone would be sufficient for us on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which I am defending; because it leaves us nothing wherein we may, as it were, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as in our own, since it shows that our not departing from God is not given except by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when it shows that it must be asked for from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For he who is not led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> does not depart from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This is absolutely not in the strength of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, such as it now is; but it had been in man before he fell. And yet how much this freedom of will availed in the excellence of that primal state appeared in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; who, when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> fell, stood in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and deserved to attain to that perpetual security of not falling, in which we are most certain that they are now established. But, after the fall of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, God willed it to pertain only to His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that man should approach to Him; nor did He will it to pertain to anything but His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that man should not depart from Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; It is God's Grace Both that Man Comes to Him, and that Man Does Not Depart from Him.</h2>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> He placed <q>in Him in whom we have obtained a lot, being <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> according to the purpose of Him who works all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153588"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse11">Ephesians&nbsp;1:11</a></span> And thus as He works that we come to Him, so He works that we do not depart. Wherefore it was said to Him by the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand, and upon the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> whom You made strong for Yourself, and we will not depart from You.</q>  This certainly is not the first Adam, in whom we departed from Him, but the second Adam, upon whom His hand is placed, so that we do not depart from Him. For Christ altogether with His members is&mdash; for the Church's sake, which is His body&mdash; the fullness of Him. When, therefore, God's hand is upon Him, that we depart not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, assuredly God's work reaches to us (for this is God's hand); by which work of God we are caused to be abiding in Christ with God&mdash; not, as in Adam, departing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <q>in Christ we have obtained a lot, being <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> according to His purpose who works all things.</q> This, therefore, is God's hand, not ours, that we depart not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. That, I say, is His hand who said, <q>I will put my <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in their hearts, that they depart not from me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153590"><a href="../bible/jer032.htm#verse40">Jeremiah&nbsp;32:40</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; Why God Willed that He Should Be Asked for that Which He Might Give Without Prayer.</h2>

<p>Wherefore, also He willed that He should be asked that we may not be led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, because if we are not led, we by no means depart from Him. And this might have been given to us even without our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for it, but by our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> He willed us to be admonished from whom we receive these benefits. For from whom do we receive but from Him from whom it is right for us to ask? Truly in this matter let not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> look for laborious disputations, but consider its own daily <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. It <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that the unbelieving may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; therefore God converts to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> may persevere; therefore God gives perseverance to the end. God foreknew that He would do this. This is the very <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <q>whom He has chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world, that they should be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and unspotted before Him in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a> them unto the adoption of children by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, to the praise of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in which He has shown them favour in His beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom they have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> according to the riches of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which has abounded towards them in all wisdom and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; that He might show them the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> according to His good pleasure which He has purposed in Him, in the dispensation of the fullness of times to restore all things in Christ which are in heaven and which are in earth; in Him, in whom also we have obtained a lot, being <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> according to His purpose who works all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153591"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse4">Ephesians&nbsp;1:4-11</a></span> Against a trumpet of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> so clear as this, what man of sober and watchful <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can receive any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> arguments?</p>

<h2>Chapter 16 [VIII.]&mdash; Why is Not Grace Given According to Merit?</h2>

<p>But <q>why,</q> says one, <q>is not the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God given according to men's merits?</q> I answer, Because God is merciful. <q>Why, then,</q> it is asked, <q>is it not given to all?</q> And here I reply, Because God is a Judge. <span class="stiki" id="note153592"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;9:20</a></span> And thus <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given by Him freely; and by His righteous judgment it is shown in some what <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> confers on those to whom it is given. Let us not then be ungrateful, that according to the good pleasure of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> a merciful God delivers so many to the praise of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from such deserved perdition; as, if He should deliver no one therefrom, He would not be unrighteous. Let him, therefore, who is delivered <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Let him who is not delivered acknowledge his due. If, in remitting a debt, goodness is perceived, in requiring it, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>&mdash; unrighteousness is never found to be with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.&mdash; The Difficulty of the Distinction Made in the Choice of One and the Rejection of Another.</h2>

<p><q>But why,</q> it is said, <q>in one and the same case, not only of infants, but even of twin children, is the judgment so diverse?</q> Is it not a similar question, <q>Why in a different case is the judgment the same?</q> Let us recall, then, those labourers in the vineyard who worked the whole day, and those who toiled one hour. Certainly the case was different as to the labour expended, and yet there was the same judgment in paying the wages. Did the murmurers in this case hear anything from the householder except, Such is my will? Certainly such was his liberality towards some, that there could be no <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> towards others. And both these classes, indeed, are among the good. Nevertheless, so far as it concerns <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said to the guilty who is condemned, also concerning the guilty who is delivered, <q>Take what is yours, and go your way;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153593"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;20:14</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> <q>I will give unto this one that which is not due;</q> <q>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will? Is your eye <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> because I am good?</q> And how if he should say, <q>Why not to me also?</q> He will hear, and with reason, <q>Who are you, O man, that repliest against God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153594"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;9:20</a></span> And although assuredly in the one case you see a most benignant benefactor, and in your own case a most righteous exactor, in neither case do you behold an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> God. For although He would be righteous even if He were to punish both, he who is delivered has good ground for thankfulness, he who is condemned has no ground for finding fault.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; But Why Should One Be Punished More Than Another?</h2>

<p><q>But if,</q> it is said, <q>it was necessary that, although all were not condemned, He should still show what was due to all, and so He should commend His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> more freely to the vessels of mercy; why in the same case will He punish me more than another, or deliver him more than me?</q> I say not this. If you ask wherefore; because I confess that I can find no answer to make. And if you further ask why is this, it is because in this matter, even as His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is righteous and as His mercy is great, so His judgments are unsearchable.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; Why Does God Mingle Those Who Will Persevere with Those Who Will Not?</h2>

<p>Let the inquirer still go on, and say, <q>Why is it that to some who have in good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> worshipped Him He has not given to persevere to the end?</q> Why except because he does not speak <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> who says, <q>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, doubtless they would have continued with us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153595"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:19</a></span> Are there, then, two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> of men? By no means. If there were two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> there would not be any <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for there would be given a gratuitous deliverance to none if it were paid as a debt to nature. But it seems to men that all who appear good <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> ought to receive perseverance to the end. But God has judged it to be better to mingle some who would not persevere with a certain number of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, so that those for whom security from <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> in this life is not desirable may not be secure. For that which the apostle says, checks many from mischievous elation: <q>Wherefore let him who seems to stand take heed lest he fall.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153596"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:12</a></span> But he who falls, falls by his own will, and he who stands, stands by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. <q>For God is able to make him stand;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153597"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;14:4</a></span> therefore he is not able to make himself stand, but God. Nevertheless, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not to be high-minded, but to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Moreover, it is in his own thought that every one either falls or stands. Now, as the apostle says, and as I have mentioned in my former treatise, <q>We are not sufficient to think anything of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153598"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> Following whom also the blessed Ambrose ventures to say, <q>For our heart is not in our own power, nor are our thoughts.</q> And this everybody who is humbly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> feels to be most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; Ambrose on God's Control Over Men's Thoughts.</h2>

<p>And when Ambrose said this, he was speaking in that treatise which he wrote concerning Flight from the World, wherein he taught that this world was to be fled not by the body, but by the heart, which he argued could not be done except by God's help. For he says: <q>We hear frequent discourse concerning fleeing from this world, and I would that the mind was as careful and solicitous as the discourse is easy; but what is worse, the enticement of earthly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> constantly creeps in, and the pouring out of vanities takes possession of the mind; so that what you desire to avoid, this you think of and consider in your mind. And this is difficult for a man to beware of, but impossible to get rid of. Finally, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that it is a matter of wish rather than of accomplishment, when he says, 'Incline my heart to Your testimonies, and not to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.'  For our heart and our thoughts are not in our own power, and these, poured forth unexpectedly, confuse our mind and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and draw them in a different direction from that which you have proposed to yourself; they recall you to worldly things, they interpose things of time, they suggest voluptuous things, they inweave enticing things, and in the very moment when we are seeking to elevate our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, we are for the most part filled with vain thoughts and cast down to earthly things.</q>  Therefore it is not in the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but in that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that men have power to become sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note153601"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;1:12</a></span> Because they receive it from Him who gives <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> thoughts to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart, by which it has <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note153602"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> for the receiving and keeping of which benefit, and for carrying it on perseveringly unto the end, we are not sufficient to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note153603"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> in whose power is our heart and our thoughts.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21 [IX.]&mdash; Instances of the Unsearchable Judgments of God.</h2>

<p>Therefore, of two infants, equally bound by original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, why the one is taken and the other left; and of two <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men of already mature years, why this one should be so called as to follow Him that calls, while that one is either not called at all, or is not called in such a manner&mdash;the judgments of God are unsearchable. But of two <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men, why to the one should be given perseverance unto the end, and to the other it should not be given, God's judgments are even more unsearchable. Yet to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> it ought to be a most certain fact that the former is of the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, the latter is not. <q>For if they had been of us,</q> says one of the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, who had drunk this secret from the breast of the Lord, <q>certainly they would have continued with us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153604"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:19</a></span> What, I ask, is the meaning of, <q>They were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would certainly have continued with us</q>? Were not both created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash; both born of Adam&mdash; both made from the earth, and given from Him who said, <q>I have created all breath,</q>  <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of one and the same nature? Lastly, had not both been called, and followed Him that called them? And had not both become, from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, justified men, and both been renewed by the laver of regeneration? But if he were to hear this who beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what he was saying, he might answer and say: These things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. In respect of all these things, they were of us. Nevertheless, in respect of a certain other distinction, they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they certainly would have continued with us. What then is this distinction? God's books lie open, let us not turn away our view; the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> cries aloud, let us give it a hearing. They were not of them, because they had not been <q>called according to the purpose;</q> they had not been chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world; they had not gained a lot in Him; they had not been <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> according to His purpose who works all things. For if they had been this, they would have been of them, and without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> they would have continued with them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; It is an Absurdity to Say that the Dead Will Be Judged for Sins Which They Would Have Committed If They Had Lived.</h2>

<p>For not to say how possible it may be for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to convert the wills of men averse and opposed to His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to operate on their hearts so that they yield to no adversities, and are overcome by no <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> so as to depart from Him&mdash;since He also can do what the apostle says, namely, not allow them to be tempted above that which they are able&mdash;not, then, to say this, God foreknowing that they would fall, was certainly able to take them away from this life before that fall should occur. Are we to return to that point of still arguing how absurdly it is said that dead men are judged even for those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreknew that they would have committed if they had lived? Which is so abhorrent to the feelings of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, or even of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, that one is even ashamed to rebut it. Why should it not be said that even the gospel itself has been preached, with so much labour and sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in vain, or is even still preached in vain, if men could be judged, even without hearing the gospel, according to the contumacy or <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreknew that they would have had if they had heard it? <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Sidon would not have been condemned, although more slightly than those cities in which, although they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> were done by Christ the Lord; because if they had been done in them, they would have repented in dust and ashes, as the utterances of the Truth declare, in which words of His the Lord Jesus shows to us the loftier <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.&mdash; Why for the People of Tyre and Sidon, Who Would Have Believed, the Miracles Were Not Done Which Were Done in Other Places Which Did Not Believe.</h2>

<p>For if we are asked why such <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were done among those who, when they saw them, would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, and were not done among those who would have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> them if they had seen them, what shall we answer? Shall we say what I have said in that book  wherein I answered some six questions of the Pagans, yet without prejudice of other matters which the wise can inquire into? This indeed I said, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, when it was asked why Christ came after so long a time: <q>that at those times and in those places in which His gospel was not preached, He foreknew that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> would, in regard of His preaching, be such as many were in His bodily presence&mdash;people, namely, who would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, even though the dead were raised by Him.</q> Moreover, a little after in the same book, and on the same question, I say, <q>What wonder, if Christ <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> in former ages that the world was so filled with unbelievers, that He was, with reason, unwilling for His gospel to be preached to them whom He foreknew to be such as would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> either His words or His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a></q>? Certainly we cannot say this of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Sidon; and in their case we recognise that those divine judgments had reference to those causes of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, without prejudice to which hidden causes I said that I was then answering such questions as those. Certainly it is easy to accuse the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, arising as it did from their <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, since they refused to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in such great wonders done among themselves. And this the Lord, reproaching them, declares when He says, <q>Woe unto you, Chorazin and <a href="../cathen/02536a.htm">Bethsaida</a>, because if the mighty works had been done in <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Sidon which have been done in you, they would long ago have repented in dust and ashes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153607"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;10:13</a></span> But can we say that even the Tyrians and Sidonians would have refused to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> such mighty works done among them, or would not have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> them if they had been done, when the Lord Himself bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to them that they would have repented with great humility if those signs of divine power had been done among them? And yet in the day of judgment they will be punished; although with a less punishment than those cities which would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the mighty works done in them. For the Lord goes on to say, <q>Nevertheless, I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153608"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;11:22</a></span> Therefore the former shall be punished with greater severity, the latter with less; but yet they shall be punished. Again, if the dead are judged even in respect of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which they would have done if they had lived, assuredly since these would have been <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> if the gospel had been preached to them with so great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, they certainly ought not to be punished; but they will be punished. It is therefore false that the dead are judged in respect also of those things which they would have done if the gospel had reached them when they were alive. And if this is false, there is no ground for saying, concerning infants who perish because they die without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, that this happens in their case deservedly, because God foreknew that if they should live and the gospel should be preached to them, they would hear it with unbelief. It remains, therefore, that they are kept bound by original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone, and for this alone they go into condemnation; and we see that in others in the same case this is not remitted, except by the gratuitous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in regeneration; and that, by His secret yet righteous judgment&mdash; because there is no unrighteousness with God&mdash; that some, who even after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> will perish by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> living, are yet kept in this life until they perish, who would not have perished if bodily death had forestalled their lapse into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and so come to their help. Because no dead man is judged by the good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things which he would have done if he had not died, otherwise the Tyrians and Sidonians would not have suffered the penalties according to what they did; but rather according to those things that they would have done, if those evangelical mighty works had been done in them, they would have obtained <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by great repentance, and by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24 [X.]&mdash; It May Be Objected that The People of Tyre and Sidon Might, If They Had Heard, Have Believed, and Have Subsequently Lapsed from Their Faith.</h2>

<p>A certain catholic disputant of no mean <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> so expounded this passage of the gospel as to say, that the Lord foreknew that the Tyrians and Sidonians would have afterwards departed from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, although they had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> done among them; and that in mercy He did not work those <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> there, because they would have been liable to severer punishment if they had forsaken the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which they had once held, than if they had at no time held it. In which opinion of a learned and exceedingly acute man, why am I now concerned to say what is still reasonably to be asked, when even this opinion serves me for the purpose at which I aim? For if the Lord in His mercy did not do mighty works among them, since by these works they might possibly become <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, so that they might not be more severely punished when they should subsequently become unbelievers, as He foreknew that they would&mdash;it is sufficiently and plainly shown that no dead person is judged for those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which He foreknew that he would have done, if in some manner he were not helped not to do them; just as Christ is said to have come to the aid of the Tyrians and Sidonians, if that opinion be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, who He would rather should not come to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at all, than that by a much greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> they should depart from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as, if they had come to it, He foresaw they would have done. Although if it be said, <q>Why was it not provided that they should rather <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and this gift should be bestowed on them, that before they forsook the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they should depart from this life</q>? I am <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> what reply can be made. For he who says that to those who would forsake their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it would have been granted, as a kindness, that they should not begin to have what, by a more serious impiety, they would subsequently forsake, sufficiently indicates that a man is not judged by that which it is foreknown he would have done ill, if by any act of kindness he may be prevented from doing it. Therefore it is an advantage also to him who is taken away, lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> should alter his understanding. But why this advantage should not have been given to the Tyrians and Sidonians, that they might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and be taken away, lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> should alter their understanding, he perhaps might answer who was pleased in such a way to solve the above question; but, as far as concerns what I am discussing, I see it to be enough that, even according to that very opinion, men are shown not to be judged in respect of those things which they have not done, even although they may have been foreseen as certain to have done them. However, as I have said, let us think shame even to refute this opinion, whereby <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are supposed to be punished in people who die or have died because they have been foreknown as certain to do them if they had lived; lest we also may seem to have thought it to be of some importance, although we would rather repress it by argument than pass it over in silence.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25 [XI.]&mdash; God's Ways, Both in Mercy and Judgment, Past Finding Out.</h2>

<p>Accordingly, as says the apostle, <q>It is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153609"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse16">Romans&nbsp;9:16</a></span> who both comes to the help of such infants as He will, although they neither will nor run, since He chose them in Christ before the foundation of the world as those to whom He intended to give His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> freely&mdash;that is, with no merits of theirs, either of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or of works, preceding; and does not come to the help of those who are more mature, although He foresaw that they would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> if they should be done among them, because He wills not to come to their help, since in His <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> He, secretly indeed, but yet righteously, has otherwise determined concerning them. For <q>there is no unrighteousness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153610"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;9:14</a></span> but <q>His judgments are unsearchable, and His ways are past finding out; all the ways of the Lord are mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>  Therefore the mercy is past finding out by which He has mercy on whom He will, no merits of his own preceding; and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is unsearchable by which He hardens whom He will, even although his merits may have preceded, but merits for the most part common to him with the man on whom He has mercy. As of two twins, of which one is taken and the other left, the end is unequal, while the deserts are common, yet in these the one is in such wise delivered by God's great goodness, that the other is condemned by no <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of God's. For is there unrighteousness with God? Away with the thought! But His ways are past finding out. Therefore let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His mercy in the case of those who are delivered, and in His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the case of those who are punished, without any hesitation; and let us not endeavour to look into that which is inscrutable, nor to trace that which cannot be found out. Because out of the mouth of babes and sucklings He perfects His praise,  so that what we see in those whose deliverance is preceded by no good deservings of theirs, and in those whose condemnation is only preceded by original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, common alike to both&mdash;this we by no means shrink from as occurring in the case of grown-up people, that is, because we do not think either that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given to any one according to his own merits, or that any one is punished except for his own merits, whether they are alike who are delivered and who are punished, or have unequal degrees of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; so that he who thinks he stands may take heed lest he fall, and he who <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> not in himself, but in the Lord.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.&mdash; The Manicheans Do Not Receive All the Books of the Old Testament, and of the New Only Those that They Choose.</h2>

<p>But wherefore is <q>the case of infants not allowed,</q> as you write, <q>to be alleged as an example for their elders,</q> by men who do not hesitate to affirm against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> that there is original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which entered by one man into the world, and that from one all have gone into condemnation?  This, the Manicheans, too, do not receive, who not only reject all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> as of authority, but even receive those which belong to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> in such a manner as that each man, by his own prerogative as it were, or rather by his own sacrilege, takes what he likes, and rejects what he does not like&mdash;in opposition to whom I treated in my writings on Free Will, whence they think that they have a ground of objection against me. I have been unwilling to deal plainly with the very laborious questions that occurred, lest my work should become too long, in a case which, as opposed to such perverse men, I could not have the assistance of the authority of the sacred Scriptures. And I was able&mdash;as I actually did, whether anything of the divine testimonies might be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or not, seeing that I did not definitely introduce them into the argument&mdash;nevertheless, by certain reasoning, to conclude that God in all things is to be praised, without any necessity of believing, as they would have us, that there are two co-eternal, confounded substances of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27.&mdash; Reference to the <q>Retractations.</q></h2>

<p>Finally, in the first book of the <em> Retractations</em>, which work of mine you have not yet read, when I had come to the reconsidering of those same books, that is, on the subject of Free Will, I thus spoke: <q>In these books,</q> I say, <q>many things were so discussed that on the occurring of some questions which either I was not able to elucidate, or which required a long discussion at once, they were so deferred as that from either side, or from all sides, of those questions in which what was most in harmony with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> did not appear, yet my reasoning might be conclusive for this, namely, that whichever of them might be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, God might be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, or even be shown, to be worthy of praise. Because that discussion was undertaken for the sake of those who deny that the origin of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is derived from the free choice of the will, and contend that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;if He be so&mdash;as the Creator of all natures, is worthy of blame; desiring in that manner, according to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of their impiety (for they are Manicheans), to introduce a certain immutable nature of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> co-eternal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Also, after a little time, in another place I say: <q>Then it was said, From this misery, most righteously inflicted on sinners, God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> delivers, because man of his own accord, that is, by <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, could fall, but could not also rise. To this misery of just condemnation belong the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and the difficulty which every man suffers from the beginning of his birth, and no one is delivered from that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> except by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this misery the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> will not have to descend from a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> condemnation, because they deny original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; although even if the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and difficulty were the natural beginnings of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, God would not even thus deserve to be reproached, but to be praised, as I have argued in the same third book.  Which argument must be regarded as against the Manicheans, who do not receive the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, in which original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is narrated; and whatever thence is read in the apostolic epistles, they contend was introduced with a detestable impudence by the corrupters of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, assuming that it was not said by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. But against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> that must be maintained which both Scriptures commend, as they profess to receive them.</q> These things I said in my first book of <em>Retractations</em>, when I was reconsidering the books on Free Will. Nor, indeed, were these things all that were said by me there about these books, but there were many others also, which I thought it would be tedious to insert in this work for you, and not necessary; and this I think you also will judge when you have read all. Although, therefore, in the third book on Free Will I have in such wise argued concerning infants, that even if what the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> say were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>&mdash;that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and difficulty, without which no man is born, are elements, not punishments, of our nature,&mdash; still the Manicheans would be overcome, who will have it that the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, to wit, of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, are co-eternal. Is, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to be called in question or forsaken, which the catholic Church maintains against those very <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, asserting as she does that it is original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the guilt of which, contracted by generation, must be remitted by regeneration? And if they confess this with us, so that we may at once, in this matter of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, destroy <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, why do they think that it must be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that God can deliver even infants, to whom He gives His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, from the power of darkness, and translate them into the kingdom of the Son of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note153616"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse13">Colossians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> In the fact, therefore, that He gives that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to some, and does not give it to others, why will they not sing to the Lord His mercy and judgment?  Why, however, is it given to these, rather than to those&mdash;who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the mind of the Lord? Who is able to look into unsearchable things? Who to trace out that which is past finding out?</p>

<h2>Chapter 28 [XII.]&mdash; God's Goodness and Righteousness Shown in All.</h2>

<p>It is therefore settled that God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not given according to the deserts of the recipients, but according to the good pleasure of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, to the praise and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His own <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; so that he who <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> may by no means <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in himself, but in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, who gives to those men to whom He will, because He is merciful, what if, however, He does not give, He is righteous: and He does not give to whom He will not, that He may make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the riches of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the vessels of mercy. <span class="stiki" id="note153618"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;9:23</a></span> For by giving to some what they do not deserve, He has certainly willed that His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> should be gratuitous, and thus genuine <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; by not giving to all, He has shown what all deserve. Good in His goodness to some, righteous in the punishment of others; both good in respect of all, because it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> when that which is due is rendered, and righteous in respect of all, since that which is not due is given without wrong to any one.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29.&mdash; God's True Grace Could Be Defended Even If There Were No Original Sin, as Pelagius Maintains.</h2>

<p>But God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that is, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> without merits, is maintained, even if infants, when <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, according to the view of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, are not plucked out of the power of darkness, because they are held guilty of no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> think, but are only transferred into the Lord's kingdom: for even thus, without any good merits, the kingdom is given to those to whom it is given; and without any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> merits it is not given to them to whom it is not given. And this we are in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of saying in opposition to the same <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, when they object to us that we attribute God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, when we say that it is given not in respect to our merits. For they themselves rather attribute God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> in the case of infants, if they say that when there is no merit it is <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>.  Certainly, even according to the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> themselves, no merits can be found in infants to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that some of them should be admitted into the kingdom, and others should be alienated from the kingdom. But now, just as in order to show that God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not given according to our merits, I preferred to maintain this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in accordance with both opinions&mdash;both in accordance with our own, to wit, who say that infants are bound by original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and according to that of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, who deny that there is original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and yet I cannot on that account <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that infants have what He can pardon them who saves His people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: so in the third book on Free Will, according to both views, I have withstood the Manicheans, whether <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and difficulty be punishments or elements of nature without which no man is born; and yet I hold one of these views. There, moreover, it is sufficiently evidently declared by me, that that is not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of man as he was ordained, but his punishment as condemned.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30.&mdash; Augustine Claims the Right to Grow in Knowledge.</h2>

<p>Therefore it is in vain that it is prescribed to me from that old book of mine, that I may not argue the case as I ought to argue it in respect of infants; and that thence I may not persuade my opponents by the light of a manifest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not given according to men's merits. For if, when I began my books concerning  Free Will as a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, and finished them as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, I still <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> of the condemnation of infants not born again, and of the deliverance of infants that were born again, no one, as I think, would be so unfair and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> as to hinder my progress, and judge that I must continue in that uncertainty. But it can more correctly be understood that it ought to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that I did not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in that matter, for the reason that they against whom my purpose was directed seemed to me in such wise to be rebutted, as that whether there was a punishment of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in infants, according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or whether there was not, as some mistaken people think, yet in no degree should such a confusion of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in, to wit, of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the Manicheans introduces. Be it therefore far from us so to forsake the case of infants as to say to ourselves that it is uncertain whether, being regenerated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, if they die in infancy they pass into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; but that, not being regenerated, they pass into the second death. Because that which is written, <q>By one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153620"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> cannot be rightly understood in any other manner; nor from that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death which is most righteously repaid to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does any deliver any one, small or great, save He who, for the sake of remitting our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, both original and personal, died without any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of His own, either original or personal. But why some rather than others? Again and again we say, and do not shrink from it, <q>O man, who are you that repliest against God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153621"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;9:20</a></span> <q>His judgments are unsearchable, and His ways past finding out.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153622"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse33">Romans&nbsp;11:33</a></span> And let us add this, <q>Seek not out the things that are too high for you, and search not the things that are above your strength.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153623"><a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse21">Sirach&nbsp;3:21</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 31.&mdash; Infants are Not Judged According to that Which They are Foreknown as Likely to Do If They Should Live.</h2>

<p>For you see, beloved, how absurd it is, and how foreign from soundness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and sincerity of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for us to say that infants, when they die, should be judged according to those things which they are foreknown to be going to do if they should live. For to this opinion, from which certainly every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feeling, on however little reason it may be founded, and especially every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> feeling, revolts, they are compelled to advance who have chosen in such wise to be withdrawn from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> as still to think that they must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and, moreover, must profess in argument, that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, by which alone after the fall of the first man, in whom we all fell, help is afforded to us, is given according to our merits. And this belief Pelagius himself, before the Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as judges, condemned in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of his own condemnation. And if this be not said of the good or bad works of those who have died, which they would have done if they had lived&mdash;and thus of no works, and works that would never exist, even in the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;if this, therefore, be not said, and you see under how great a mistake it is said, what will remain but that we confess, when the darkness of contention is removed, that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is not given according to our merits, which position the catholic Church defends against the Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; and that we see this in more evident <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> especially in infants? For God is not compelled by <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> to come to the help of these infants, and not to come to the help of those&mdash;since the case is alike to both. Or shall we think that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs in the case of infants are not managed by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, but by fortuitous chances, when rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are either to be condemned or delivered, although, indeed, not a sparrow falls to the ground without the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of our Father which is in heaven? <span class="stiki" id="note153624"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;10:29</a></span> Or must we so attribute it to the negligence of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> that infants die without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as that heavenly judgments have nothing to do with it; as if they themselves who in this way die badly had of their own will chosen the negligent <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> for themselves of whom they were born? What shall I say when an infant expires some time before he can possibly be advantaged by the ministry of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>? For often when the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> are eager and the ministers prepared for giving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to the infants, it still is not given, because God does not choose; since He has not kept it in this life for a little while in order that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> might be given it. What, moreover, when sometimes aid could be afforded by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to the children of unbelievers, that they should not go into perdition, and could not be afforded to the children of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>? In which case it is certainly shown that there is no acceptance of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; otherwise He would rather deliver the children of His worshippers than the children of His enemies.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32 [XIII.]&mdash; The Inscrutability of God's Free Purposes.</h2>

<p>But now, since we are now treating of the gift of perseverance, why is it that aid is afforded to the person about to die who is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, while to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> person about to fall, aid is not afforded, so as to die before? Unless, perchance, we shall still listen to that absurdity by which it is said that it is of no advantage to any one to die before his fall, because he will be judged according to those actions which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreknew that he would have done if he had lived. Who can hear with patience this perversity, so violently opposed to the soundness of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Who can bear it? And yet they are driven to say this who do not confess that God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not bestowed in respect of our deservings. They, however, who will not say that any one who has died is judged according to those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreknew that he would have done if he had lived, considering with how manifest a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> and how great an absurdity this would be said, have no further reason to say, what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> condemned in the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, and caused to be condemned by Pelagius himself&mdash;that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely, is given according to our merits,&mdash; when they see some infants not regenerated taken from this life to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death, and others regenerated, to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; and those themselves that are regenerated, some going hence, persevering even to the end, and others kept in this life even until they fall, who certainly would not have fallen if they had departed hence before their lapse; and again some falling, but not departing from this life until they return, who certainly would have perished if they had departed before their return.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33.&mdash; God Gives Both Initiatory and Persevering Grace According to His Own Will.</h2>

<p>From all which it is shown with sufficient clearness that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which both begins a man's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and which enables it to persevere unto the end, is not given according to our merits, but is given according to His own most secret and at the same time most righteous, wise, and beneficent will; since those whom He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, them He also called, <span class="stiki" id="note153625"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse30">Romans&nbsp;8:30</a></span> with that calling of which it is said, <q>The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153626"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;11:29</a></span> To which calling there is no man that can be said by men with any certainty of affirmation to belong, until he has departed from this world; but in this life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which is a state of trial upon the earth, <span class="stiki" id="note153627"><a href="../bible/job007.htm#verse1">Job&nbsp;7:1</a></span> he who seems to stand must take heed lest he fall. <span class="stiki" id="note153628"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:12</a></span> Since (as I have already said before)  those who will not persevere are, by the most foreseeing <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, mingled with those who will persevere, for the reason that we may learn not to mind high things, but to consent to the lowly, and may <q>work out our own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling; for it is God that works in us both to will and to do for His good pleasure.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153630"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse12">Philippians&nbsp;2:12-13</a></span> We therefore will, but God works in us to will also. We therefore work, but God works in us to work also for His good pleasure. This is profitable for us both to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and to say&mdash;this is <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that our confession be lowly and submissive, and that all should be given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

For <q>our heart and our thoughts are not in our own power;</q> whence the same Ambrose who says this says also: <q>But who is so blessed as in his heart always to rise upwards? And how can this be done without divine help? Assuredly, by no means. Finally,</q> he says, <q>the same Scripture affirms above, 'Blessed is the man whose help is of You; O Lord,  ascent is in his heart.'</q>  Assuredly, Ambrose was not only enabled to say this by reading in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writings, but as of such a man is to be without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, he felt it also in his own heart. Therefore, as is said in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, that we should lift up our hearts to the Lord, is God's gift; for which gift they to whom this is said are admonished by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> after this word to give thanks to our Lord God Himself; and they answer that it is <q>meet and right so to do.</q>  For, since our heart is not in our own power, but is lifted up by the divine help, so that it ascends and takes cognizance of those things which are above, <span class="stiki" id="note153636"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse1">Colossians&nbsp;3:1</a></span> where Christ is sitting at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, not those things that are upon the earth, to whom are thanks to be given for so great a gift as this unless to our Lord God who does this&mdash;who in so great kindness has chosen us by delivering us from the abyss of this world, and has <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> us before the foundation of the world?</p>

<h2>Chapter 34 [XIV.]&mdash; The Doctrine of Predestination Not Opposed to the Advantage of Preaching.</h2>

<p>But they say that the <q>definition of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is opposed to the advantage of preaching,</q> &mdash; as if, indeed, it were opposed to the preaching of the apostle! Did not that teacher of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> so often, in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, both commend <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, and not cease to preach the word of God? Because he said, <q>It is God that works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153638"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;2:13</a></span> did he not also exhort that we should both will and do what is pleasing to God? Or because he said, <q>He who has begun a good work in you shall carry it on even unto the day of Christ Jesus,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153639"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;1:6</a></span> did he on that account cease to persuade men to begin and to persevere unto the end? Doubtless, our Lord Himself commanded men to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and said, <q>Believe in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also in me:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153640"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;14:1</a></span> and yet His opinion is not therefore false, nor is His definition idle when He says, <q>No man comes unto me</q>&mdash; that is, no man <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in me&mdash; <q>except it has been given him of my Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153641"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse66">John&nbsp;6:66</a></span> Nor, again, because this definition is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, is the former precept vain. Why, therefore, do we think the definition of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> useless to preaching, to precept, to exhortation, to rebuke&mdash;all which things the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> repeats frequently&mdash;seeing that the same Scripture commends this doctrine?</p>

<h2>Chapter 35.&mdash; What Predestination is.</h2>

<p>Will any man dare to say that God did not foreknow those to whom He would give to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, or whom He would give to His Son, that of them He should lose none? <span class="stiki" id="note153642"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;18:9</a></span> And certainly, if He foreknew these things, He as certainly foreknew His own kindnesses, wherewith He condescends to deliver us. This is the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>&mdash;nothing else; to wit, the foreknowledge and the preparation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'s kindnesses, whereby they are most certainly delivered, whoever they are that are delivered. But where are the rest left by the righteous divine judgment except in the mass of ruin, where the Tyrians and the Sidonians were left? Who, moreover, might have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> if they had seen Christ's wonderful <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. But since it was not given to them to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, the means of believing also were denied them. From which fact it appears that some have in their understanding itself a naturally divine gift of intelligence, by which they may be moved to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if they either hear the words or behold the signs congruous to their minds; and yet if, in the higher judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they are not by the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> separated from the mass of perdition, neither those very divine words nor <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are applied to them by which they might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> if they only heard or saw such things. Moreover, in the same mass of ruin the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were left, because they could not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> such great and eminent mighty works as were done in their sight. For the gospel has not been silent about the reason why they could not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, since it says: <q>But though He had done such great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> before them, yet they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not on Him; that the saying of Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> might be fulfilled which he spoke, <span class="stiki" id="note153643"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;53:1</a></span> Lord, who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? And, therefore, they could not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, because that Isaiah said again, <span class="stiki" id="note153644"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;6:10</a></span> He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</q>  Therefore the eyes of the Tyrians and Sidonians were not so blinded nor was their heart so hardened, since they would have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> if they had seen such mighty works, as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> saw. But it did not profit them that they were able to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, because they were not <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> by Him whose judgments are inscrutable and His ways past finding out. Neither would inability to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> have been a hindrance to them, if they had been so <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> as that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should illuminate those blind eyes, and should will to take away the stony heart from those hardened ones. But what the Lord said of the Tyrians and Sidonians may perchance be understood in another way: that no one nevertheless comes to Christ unless it were given him, and that it is given to those who are chosen in Him before the foundation of the world, he confesses beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> who hears the divine utterance, not with the deaf ears of the flesh, but with the ears of the heart; and yet this <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, which is plainly enough unfolded even by the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a>, did not prevent the Lord's saying as well in respect of the commencement, what I have a little before mentioned, <q>Believe in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also in me,</q> as in respect of perseverance, <q>A man ought always to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and not to faint.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153646"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;18:1</a></span> For they hear these things and do them to whom it is given; but they do them not, whether they hear or do not hear, to whom it is not given. Because, <q>To you,</q> said He, <q>it is given to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, but to them it is not given.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153647"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;13:11</a></span> Of these, the one refers to the mercy, the other to the judgment of Him to whom our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cries, <q>I will sing of mercy and judgment unto You, O Lord.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 36.&mdash; The Preaching of the Gospel and the Preaching of Predestination the Two Parts of One Message.</h2>

<p>Therefore, by the preaching of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, the preaching of a persevering and progressive <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not to be hindered; and thus they may hear what is necessary to whom it is given that they should <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>. For how shall they hear without a preacher? Neither, again, is the preaching of a progressive <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which continues even to the end to hinder the preaching of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, so that he who is living faithfully and obediently may not be lifted up by that very <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, as if by a benefit of his own, not received; but that he that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord. For <q>we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own.</q> And this, Cyprian most faithfully saw and most fearlessly explained, and thus he pronounced <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> to be most assured.  For if we must boast in nothing, seeing that nothing is our own, certainly we must not boast of the most persevering <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. Nor is it so to be called our own, as if it were not given to us from above. And, therefore, it is God's gift, which, by the confession of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, God foreknew that He would give to His people, who were called by that calling whereof it was said, <q>The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153650"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;11:29</a></span> This, then, is the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> which we faithfully and humbly preach. Nor yet did the same teacher and doer, who both <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Christ and most perseveringly lived in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, even to suffering for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, cease on that account to preach the gospel, to exhort to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> manners, and to that very perseverance to the end, because he said, <q>We must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own;</q> and here he declared without ambiguity the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, that which is not given in respect of our merits; and since God foreknew that He would give it, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> was announced beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> by these words of Cyprian; and if this did not prevent Cyprian from preaching <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, it certainly ought not to prevent us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 37.&mdash; Ears to Hear are a Willingness to Obey.</h2>

<p>Although, therefore, we say that <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we still exhort men to it. But to those who obediently hear the exhortation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is given the gift of God itself&mdash; that is, to hear obediently; while to those who do not thus hear it is not given. For it was not some one only, but Christ who said, <q>No man comes unto me, except it were given him of my Father;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153651"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse66">John&nbsp;6:66</a></span> and, <q>To you it is given to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, but to them it is not given.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153652"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;13:11</a></span> And concerning continence He says, <q>Not all receive this saying, but they to whom it is given.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153653"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;19:11</a></span> And when the apostle would exhort married people to conjugal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, he says, <q>I would that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were even as I myself; but every man has his proper gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one after this manner, another after that;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153654"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:7</a></span> where he plainly shows not only that continence is a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but even the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of those who are married. And although these things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, we still exhort to them as much as is given to any one of us to be able to exhort, because this also is His gift in whose hand are both ourselves and our discourses. Whence also says the apostle, <q>According to this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God which is given unto me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153655"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:10</a></span> And in another place he says, <q>Even as the Lord has given to every man: I have planted, Apollos has watered, but God has given the increase. Therefore neither is he that plants anything, nor he that waters, but God that gives the increase.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153656"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> And thus as only he preaches and exhorts rightly who has received this gift, so assuredly he who obediently hears him who rightly exhorts and preaches is he who has received this gift. Hence is what the Lord said, when, speaking to those who had their fleshly ears open, He nevertheless told them, <q>He that has ears to hear let him hear;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153657"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;8:8</a></span> which beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that not all had. And from whom they have, whosoever they be that have them, the Lord Himself shows when He says, <q>I will give them a heart to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me, and ears to hear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153658"><a href="../bible/bar002.htm#verse31">Baruch&nbsp;2:31</a></span> Therefore, having ears is itself the gift of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a>, so that they who had that came to Him, to whom <q>no one comes unless it were given to him of His Father.</q> Therefore we exhort and preach, but they who have ears to hear obediently hear us, while in them who have them not, it comes to pass what is written, that hearing they do not hear&mdash;hearing, to wit, with the bodily sense, they do not hear with the assent of the heart. But why these should have ears to hear, and those have them not&mdash;that is, why to these it should be given by the Father to come to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, while to those it should not be given&mdash;who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the mind of the Lord, or who has been His counsellor? Or who are you, O man, that repliest against God? Must that which is manifest be denied, because that which is hidden cannot be comprehended? Shall we, I say, declare that what we see to be so is not so, because we cannot find out why it is so?</p>

<h2>Chapter 38 [XV.]&mdash; Against the Preaching of Predestination the Same Objections May Be Alleged as Against Predestination.</h2>

<p>But they say, as you write: <q>That no one can be aroused by the incentives of rebuke if it be said in the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the multitude of hearers: The definite meaning of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> stands in such wise, that some of you will receive the will to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> and will come out of unbelief unto <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or will receive perseverance and abide in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but others who are lingering in the delight of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have not yet arisen, for the reason that the aid of pitying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has not yet indeed raised you up. But yet, if there are any whom by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> He has <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be chosen, who are not yet called, you shall receive that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by which you may will and be chosen; and if any <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, if you are <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be rejected, the strength to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> shall be withdrawn from you, so that you may cease to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>.</q> Although these things may be said, they ought not so to deter us from confessing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;that is, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is not given to us in respect of our merits,&mdash; and from confessing the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in accordance therewith, even as we are not deterred from confessing God's foreknowledge, although one should thus speak to the people concerning it, and say: <q>Whether you are now living righteously or unrighteously, you shall be such by and by as the Lord has foreknown that you will be&mdash;either good, if He has foreknown you as good, or bad, if He has foreknown you as bad.</q> For if on the hearing of this some should be turned to torpor and slothfulness, and from striving should go headlong to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after their own desires, is it therefore to be counted that what has been said about the foreknowledge of God is false? If God has foreknown that they will be good, will they not be good, whatever be the depth of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in which they are now engaged? And if He has foreknown them <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, will they not be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whatever goodness may now be discerned in them? There was a man in our <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, who, when the brethren rebuked him for doing some things that ought not to be done, and for not doing some things that ought to be done, replied, <q>Whatever I may now be, I shall be such as God has foreknown that I shall be.</q> And this man certainly both said what was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and was not profited by this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> for good, but so far made way in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as to desert the society of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and become a dog returned to his vomit; and, nevertheless, it is uncertain what he is yet to become. For the sake of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of this kind, then, is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is spoken about God's foreknowledge either to be denied or to be kept back&mdash;at such times, for instance, when, if it is not spoken, other <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> are incurred?</p>

<h2>Chapter 39 [XVI]&mdash; Prayer and Exhortation.</h2>

<p>There are some, moreover, who either do not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> at all, or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> coldly, because, from the Lord's words, they have learned that God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what is necessary for us before we ask it of Him. Must the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this declaration be given up, or shall we think that it should be erased from the gospel because of such people? Nay, since it is manifest that God has prepared some things to be given even to those who do not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them, such as the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and other things not to be given except to those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them, such as perseverance even unto the end, certainly he who thinks that he has this latter from himself does not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to have it. Therefore we must take care lest, while we are afraid of exhortation growing lukewarm, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should be stifled and arrogance stimulated.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40.&mdash; When the Truth Must Be Spoken, When Kept Back.</h2>

<p>Therefore let the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be spoken, especially when any question impels us to declare it; and let them receive it who are able, lest, perchance, while we are silent on account of those who cannot receive it, they be not only defrauded of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> but be taken captive by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, who are able to receive the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whereby <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> may be avoided. For it is easy, nay, and it is useful, that some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should be kept back because of those who are incapable of apprehending it. For whence is that word of our Lord: <q>I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note153659"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;16:12</a></span> And that of the apostle: <q>I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal: as if unto babes in Christ I have given you to drink milk, and not meat, for hitherto you were not able, neither yet indeed now are you able</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note153660"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:1</a></span> Although, in a certain manner of speaking, it might happen that what is said should be both milk to infants and meat for grown-up <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. As <q>in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153661"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> what <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> can keep it back? Who can receive it? Or what in sound doctrine can be found more comprehensive? And yet this is not kept back either from infants or from grown-up people, nor is it hidden from infants by those who are mature. But the reason of keeping back the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is one, the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of speaking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is another. It would be a tedious business to inquire into or to put down all the reasons for keeping back the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; of which, nevertheless, there is this one&mdash;lest we should make those who do not understand worse, while wishing to make those who do understand more learned; although these latter do not become more learned when we withhold any such thing on the one hand, but also do not become worse. When, however, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is of such a nature that he who cannot receive it is made worse by our speaking it, and he who can receive it is made worse by our silence concerning it, what do we think is to be done? Must we not speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that he who can receive it may receive it, rather than keep silence, so that not only neither may receive it, but that even he who is more intelligent should himself be made worse? For if he should hear and receive it, by his means also many might learn. For in proportion as he is more capable of learning, he is the more fitted for teaching others. The enemy of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> presses on and urges in all ways to make us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given according to our deservings, and thus <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is no more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and are we unwilling to say what we can say by the testimony of Scripture? Do we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, forsooth, to offend by our speaking him who is not able to receive the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? And are we not afraid lest by our silence he who can receive the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may be involved in <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 41.&mdash; Predestination Defined as Only God's Disposing of Events in His Foreknowledge.</h2>

<p>For either <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> must be preached, in the way and degree in which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> plainly declares it, so that in the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> the gifts and calling of God may be without repentance; or it must be avowed that God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given according to our merits,&mdash; which is the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>; although that opinion of theirs, as I have often said already, may be read in the Proceedings of the Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to have been condemned by the lips of Pelagius himself.  Further, those on whose account I am discoursing are only removed from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> perversity of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, inasmuch as, although they will not confess that they who by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are made <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> and so abide, are <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, they still confess, nevertheless, that this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> precedes their will to whom it is given; in such a way certainly as that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may not be thought to be given freely, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> declares, but rather according to the merits of a preceding will, as the Pelagian <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> says, in contradiction to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore, also, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; otherwise, if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> will also precedes it, because there cannot be <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without will. But if <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> precedes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> because it precedes will, certainly it precedes all <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>; it also precedes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, by which alone God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and pleasantly <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>. And all these things <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> works in him to whom it is given, and in whom it precedes all these things. [XVII.] Among these benefits there remains perseverance unto the end, which is daily asked for in vain from the Lord, if the Lord by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does not effect it in him whose <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> He hears. See now how foreign it is from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to deny that perseverance even to the end of this life is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since He Himself puts an end to this life when He wills, and if He puts an end before a fall that is threatening, He makes the man to persevere even unto the end. But more marvellous and more manifest to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> is the largess of God's goodness, that this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given even to infants, although there is no <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> at that age to which it may be given. To whomsoever, therefore, God gives His gifts, beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> He has foreknown that He will bestow them on them, and in His foreknowledge He has prepared them for them. Therefore, those whom He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, them He also called with that calling which I am not reluctant often to make mention of, of which it is said, <q>The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153663"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;11:24</a></span> For the ordering of His future works in His foreknowledge, which cannot be deceived and changed, is absolute, and is nothing but, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. But, as he whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has foreknown to be chaste, although he may regard it as uncertain, so acts as to be chaste, so he whom He has <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be chaste, although he may regard that as uncertain, does not, therefore, fail to act so as to be chaste because he hears that he is to be what he will be by the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nay, rather, his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> rejoices, and he is not puffed up as if he had not received it. Not only, therefore, is he not hindered from this work by the preaching of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, but he is even assisted to it, so that although he glories he may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord.</p>

<h2>Chapter 42.&mdash; The Adversaries Cannot Deny Predestination to Those Gifts of Grace Which They Themselves Acknowledge, and Their Exhortations are Not Hindered by This Predestination Nevertheless.</h2>

<p>And what I said of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, can be said also of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, of perseverance, and, not to enumerate single <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, it may be said with the utmost <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfulness</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>. But those who place only the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and perseverance to the end in such wise in our power as not to regard them as God's gifts, nor to think that God works on our thoughts and wills so as that we may have and retain them, grant, nevertheless, that He gives other things&mdash;since they are obtained from Him by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the believer. Why are they not afraid that exhortation to these other things, and the preaching of these other things, should be hindered by the definition of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>? Or, perchance, do they say that such things are not <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>? Then they are not given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or He has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that He would give them. Because, if they are both given, and He foreknew that He would give them, certainly He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> them. As, therefore, they themselves also exhort to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, charity, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and other things which they confess to be God's gifts, and cannot deny that they are also foreknown by Him, and therefore <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>; nor do they say that their exhortations are hindered by the preaching of God's <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, that is, by the preaching of God's foreknowledge of those future gifts of His: so they may see that neither are their exhortations to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or to perseverance hindered, even although those very things may be said, as is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to be gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that those things are foreknown, that is, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be given; but let them rather see that by this preaching of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> only that most pernicious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is hindered and overthrown, whereby it is said that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is given according to our deservings, so that he who glories may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> not in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, but in himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 43.&mdash; Further Development of the Foregoing Argument.</h2>

<p>And in order that I may more openly unfold this for the sake of those who are somewhat slow of apprehension, let those who are endowed with an intelligence that flies in advance bear with my delay. The Apostle James says, <q>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gives to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> liberally and upbraids not, and it shall be given him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153664"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse5">James&nbsp;1:5</a></span> It is written also in the Proverbs of Solomon, <q>Because theLord gives wisdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153665"><a href="../bible/pro002.htm#verse6">Proverbs&nbsp;2:6</a></span> And of continency it is read in the book of Wisdom, whose authority has been used by great and learned men who have commented upon the divine utterances long before us; there, therefore, it is read, <q>When I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that no one can be continent unless God gives it, and that this was of wisdom, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whose gift this was.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153666"><a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse21">Wisdom&nbsp;8:21</a></span> Therefore these are God's gifts,&mdash; that is, to say nothing of others, wisdom and continency. Let those also acquiesce: for they are not <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, to contend against such a manifest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as this with hard and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> perversity. <q>But,</q> say they, <q>that these things are given to us of God is obtained by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which has its beginning from us;</q> and both to begin to have this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to abide in it even to the end, they contend is our own doing, as if we received it not from the Lord. This, beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, is in contradiction to the apostle when he says, <q>For what have you that you have not received?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153667"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> It is in contradiction also to the saying of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Cyprian, <q>That we must boast in nothing, since nothing is our own.</q>  When we have said this, and many other things which it is wearisome to repeat, and have shown that both the commencement of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and perseverance to the end are gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and that it is impossible that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should not foreknow any of His future gifts, as well what should be given as to whom they should be given; and that thus those whom He delivers and crowns are <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> by Him; they think it well to reply, <q>that the assertion of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is opposed to the advantage of preaching, for the reason that when this is heard no one can be stirred up by the incentives of rebuke.</q> When they say this, <q>they are unwilling that it should be declared to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that coming to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and abiding in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are God's gifts, lest despair rather than encouragement should appear to be suggested, inasmuch as they who hear think that it is uncertain to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> on whom God bestows, or on whom He does not bestow, these gifts.</q> Why, then, do they themselves also preach with us that wisdom and continency are God's gifts? But if, when these things are declared to be God's gifts, there is no hindrance of the exhortation with which we exhort men to be wise and continent; what is after all the reason for their thinking that the exhortation is hindered wherewith we exhort men to come to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to abide in it to the end, if these also are said to be God's gifts, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, which are His witnesses?</p>

<h2>Chapter 44.&mdash; Exhortation to Wisdom, Though Wisdom is God's Gift.</h2>

<p>Now, to say nothing more of continency, and to argue in this place of wisdom alone, certainly the Apostle James above mentioned says, <q>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, modest, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, inestimable, without simulation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153669"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse17">James&nbsp;3:17</a></span> Do you not see, I beseech you, how this wisdom descends from the Father of Lights, laden with many and great benefits? Because, as the same apostle says, <q>Every excellent gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of Lights.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153670"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse17">James&nbsp;3:17</a></span> Why, then&mdash; to set aside other matters&mdash; do we rebuke the impure and contentious, to whom we nevertheless preach that the gift of God is wisdom, pure and peaceable; and are not afraid that they should be influenced, by the uncertainty of the divine will, to find in this preaching more of despair than of exhortation; and that they should not be stirred up by the incentives of rebuke rather against us than against themselves, because we rebuke them for not having those things which we ourselves say are not produced by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, but are given by the divine liberality? Finally, why did the preaching of this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> not deter the Apostle James from rebuking restless <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and saying, <q>If you have bitter envying, and contentions are in your hearts, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> not, and be not liars against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, animal, devilish; for where envying and contention are, there are inconstancy and every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> work</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note153671"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse14">James&nbsp;3:14</a></span> As, therefore, the restless are to be rebuked, both by the testimony of the divine declarations, and by those very impulses of ours which they have in common with ourselves; and is it no argument against this rebuke that we declare the peaceful wisdom, whereby the contentions are corrected and healed, to be the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; unbelievers are in such wise to be rebuked, as those who do not abide in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, without any hindrance to that rebuke from the preaching of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, although that preaching commends that very <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and the continuance in it as the gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Because, although wisdom is obtained from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, even as James himself, when he had said, <q>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gives to all liberally and upbraids not, and it shall be given,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153672"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse5">James&nbsp;1:5</a></span> immediately added, <q>But let him ask in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nothing wavering:</q> it is not, nevertheless, because <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is given before it is asked for by him to whom it is given, that it must therefore be said not to be the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to be of ourselves, because it is given to us without our asking for it! For the apostle very plainly says, <q>Peace be to the brethren, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153673"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse23">Ephesians&nbsp;6:23</a></span> From whom, therefore, are peace and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, from Him also is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; wherefore, from Him we ask not only that it may be increased to those that possess it, but also that it may be given to those that possess it not.</p>

<h2>Chapter 45.&mdash; Exhortation to Other Gifts of God in Like Manner.</h2>

<p>Nor do those on whose account I am saying these things, who cry out that exhortation is checked by the preaching of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, exhort to those gifts alone which they contend are not given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but are from ourselves, such as are the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and perseverance in it even to the end. This certainly they ought to do, in such a way as only to exhort unbelievers to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> to continue to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. But those things which with us they do not deny to be God's gifts, so as that with us they demolish the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, such as modesty, continence, patience, and other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> that pertain to a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life, and are obtained by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from the Lord, they ought to show as needing to be <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for, and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for only, either for themselves or others; but they ought not to exhort any one to strive after them and retain them. But when they exhort to these things, according to their ability, and confess that men ought to be exhorted&mdash;certainly they show plainly enough that exhortations are not hindered by that preaching, whether they are exhortations to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or to perseverance to the end, because we also preach that such things are God's gifts, and are not given by any man to himself, but are given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 46.&mdash; A Man Who Does Not Persevere Fails by His Own Fault.</h2>

<p>But it is said, <q>It is by his own fault that any one deserts the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when he yields and consents to the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his desertion of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> Who denies it? But because of this, perseverance in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not to be said not to be a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is this that a man daily asks for when he says, <q>Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153674"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;6:13</a></span> and if he is heard, it is this that he receives. And thus as he daily asks for perseverance, he assuredly places the hope of his perseverance not in himself, but in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I, however, am loth to exaggerate the case with my words, but I rather leave it to them to consider, and see what it is of which they have persuaded themselves&mdash; to wit, <q>that by the preaching of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, more of despair than of exhortation is impressed upon the hearers.</q> For this is to say that a man then despairs of his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> when he has learned to place his hope not in himself, but in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> cries, <q>Cursed is he who has his hope in man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153675"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:5</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 47.&mdash; Predestination is Sometimes Signified Under the Name of Foreknowledge.</h2>

<p>These gifts, therefore, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which are given to the elect who are called according to God's purpose, among which gifts is both the beginning of belief and perseverance in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the termination of this life, as I have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by such a concurrent testimony of reasons and authorities,&mdash; these gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I say, if there is no such <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> as I am maintaining, are not foreknown by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But they are foreknown. This, therefore, is the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> which I maintain. [XVIII.] Consequently sometimes the same <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is signified also under the name of foreknowledge; as says the apostle, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not rejected His people whom He foreknew.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153676"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;11:2</a></span> Here, when he says, <q>He foreknew,</q> the sense is not rightly understood except as <q>He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>,</q> as is shown by the context of the passage itself. For he was speaking of the remnant of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> which were saved, while the rest perished. For above he had said that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had declared to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <q>All day long I have stretched forth my hands to an unbelieving and a gainsaying people.</q>  And as if it were answered, What, then, has become of the promises of God to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? He added in continuation, <q>I say, then, has God cast away His people? God forbid! For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, of the tribe of Benjamin.</q> Then he added the words which I am now treating: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not cast away His people whom He foreknew.</q> And in order to show that the remnant had been left by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not by any merits of their works, he went on to add, <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says in Elias, in what way he makes intercession with God against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</q>  and the rest. <q>But what,</q> says he, <q>says the answer of God unto him? 'I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee before <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>.'</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153679"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;11:5</a></span> For He says not, <q>There are left to me,</q> or <q>They have reserved themselves to me,</q> but, <q>I have reserved to myself.</q> <q>Even so, then, at this present time also there is made a remnant by the election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And if of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, then it is no more by works; otherwise <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is no more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> And connecting this with what I have above quoted, <q>What then?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153680"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;11:7</a></span> and in answer to this inquiry, he says, <q><a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has not obtained that which he was seeking for, but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded.</q> Therefore, in the election, and in this remnant which were made so by the election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he wished to be understood the people which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not reject, because He foreknew them. This is that election by which He elected those, whom He willed, in Christ before the foundation of the world, that they should be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and without spot in His sight, in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinating</a> them unto the adoption of sons. No one, therefore, who understands these things is permitted to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that, when the apostle says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not cast away His people whom He foreknew,</q> He intended to signify <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. For He foreknew the remnant which He should make so according to the election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. That is, therefore, He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> them; for without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> He foreknew if He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>; but to have <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> is to have foreknown that which He should do.</p>

<h2>Chapter 48 [XIX.]&mdash; Practice of Cyprian and Ambrose.</h2>

<p>What, then, hinders us, when we read of God's foreknowledge in some commentators on God's word, and they are treating of the calling of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, from understanding the same <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>? For they would perchance have rather used in this matter this word which, moreover, is better understood, and which is not inconsistent with, nay, is in accordance with, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is declared concerning the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. This I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that no one has been able to dispute, except erroneously, against that <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> which I am maintaining in accordance with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>. Yet I think that they who ask for the opinions of commentators on this matter ought to be satisfied with men so <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and so laudably celebrated everywhere in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine as Cyprian and Ambrose, of whom I have given such clear testimonies; and that for both doctrines&mdash; that is, that they should both <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> absolutely and preach everywhere that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is gratuitous, as we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and declare it to be; and that they should not think that preaching opposed to the preaching whereby we exhort the indolent or rebuke the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; because these celebrated men also, although they were preaching God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in such a manner as that one of them said, <q>That we must boast in nothing, because nothing is our own;</q>  and the other, <q>Our heart and our thoughts are not in our own power;</q>  yet ceased not to exhort and rebuke, in order that the divine commands might be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>. Neither were they afraid of its being said to them, <q>Why do you exhort us, and why do you rebuke us, if no good thing that we have is from us, and if our hearts are not in our own power?</q> These <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men could by no means <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that such things should be said to them, since they were of the mind to understand that it is given to very few to receive the teaching of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through God Himself, or through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of heaven, without any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> preaching to them; but that it is given to many to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> agency. Yet, in whatever manner the word of God is spoken to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> for man to hear it in such a way as to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> it, is God's gift.</p>

<h2>Chapter 49.&mdash; Further References to Cyprian and Ambrose.</h2>

<p>Wherefore, the above-mentioned most excellent commentators on the divine declarations both preached the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God as it ought to be preached&mdash;that is, as a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> preceded by no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> deservings,&mdash; and urgently exhorted to the doing of the divine commandments, that they who might have the gift of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> should hear what commands they ought to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>. For if any merits of ours precede <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, certainly it is the merit of some deed, or word, or thought, wherein also is understood a good will itself. But he very briefly summed up the kinds of all deservings who said, <q>We must <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in nothing, because nothing is our own.</q> And he who says, <q>Our heart and our thoughts are not in our own power,</q> did not pass over acts and words also, for there is no act or word of man which does not proceed from the heart and the thought. But what more could that most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and most luminous doctor Cyprian say concerning this matter, than when he impressed upon us that it behooves us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, in the Lord's Prayer, even for the adversaries of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, showing what he thought of the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that it also is God's gift, and pointing out that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> daily for perseverance unto the end, because none but God gives that perseverance to those who have persevered? Moreover, the blessed Ambrose, when he was expounding the passage where the Evangelist Luke says, <q>It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to me also,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153683"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;1:3</a></span> says, <q>What he declares to have seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to himself cannot have seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to him alone. For not alone by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will did it seem good, but as it pleased Him who speaks in me, Christ, who effects that that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may also seem good to us: for whom He has mercy on He also calls. And therefore he who follows Christ may answer, when he is asked why he wished to become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, 'It seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to me also.' And when he says this, he does not deny that it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of men is prepared by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be honoured by the saint.</q>  Moreover, in the same work&mdash;that is, in the exposition of the same <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, when he had come to that place where the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> would not receive the Lord when His face was as going to Jerusalem,&mdash; he says, <q>Learn at the same time that He would not be received by those who were not converted in simpleness of mind. For if He had been willing, He would have made them devout who were undevout. And why they would not receive Him, the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> himself mentioned, saying, 'Because His face was as of one going towards Jerusalem.' <span class="stiki" id="note153685"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse53">Luke&nbsp;9:53</a></span> But the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> earnestly desired to be received into <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. But God calls those whom He makes worthy, and makes religious whom He will.</q>  What more evident, what more manifest do we ask from commentators on God's word, if we are pleased to hear from them what is clear in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>? But to these two, who ought to be enough, let us add also a third, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Gregory, who testifies that it is the gift of God both to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God and to confess what we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, saying, <q>I beg of you confess the Trinity of one godhead; but if you wish otherwise, say that it is of one nature, and God will be besought that a voice shall be given to you by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>;</q> that is, God will be besought to allow a voice to be given to you by which you may confess what you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. <q>For He will give, I am certain. He who gave what is first, will give also what is second.</q>  He who gave belief, will also give confession.</p>

<h2>Chapter 50.&mdash; Obedience Not Discouraged by Preaching God's Gifts.</h2>

<p>Such doctors, and so great as these, when they say that there is nothing of which we may boast as if of our own which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not given us, and that our very heart and our thoughts are not in our own power; and when they give the whole to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and confess that from Him we receive that we are converted to Him in such wise as to continue&mdash;that that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> appears also to us to be good, and we wish for it&mdash;that we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> God and receive Christ,&mdash; that from undevout people we are made devout and religious,&mdash; that we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Trinity itself, and also confess with our voice what we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>:&mdash; certainly attribute all these things to God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, acknowledge them as God's gifts, and testify that they come to us from Him, and are not from ourselves. But will any one say that they in such wise confessed that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God as to venture to deny His foreknowledge,which not only learned but unlearned men also confess? Again, if they had so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that God gives these things that they were not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that He foreknew that He would give them, and could not have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> to whom He would give them: beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> which, as preached by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, we laboriously and diligently maintain against the modern <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Nor would it be with any manner of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> said, nevertheless, to them because they preach <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, and fervently exhort, to the extent of the ability of each one, to its practice, <q>If you do not wish that the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to which you are stirring us up should grow cold in our heart, forbear to preach to us that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God by which you confess that God gives what you are exhorting us to do.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 51 [XX.]&mdash; Predestination Must Be Preached.</h2>

<p>Wherefore, if both the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">teachers of the Church</a> who succeeded them and imitated them did both these things&mdash;that is, both <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> preached the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God which is not given according to our merits, and inculcated by wholesome precepts a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>&mdash;what is it which these people of our time think themselves rightly bound by the invincible force of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to say, <q>Even if what is said of the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of God's benefits be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, yet it must not be preached to the people</q>?  It must absolutely be preached, so that he who has ears to hear, may hear. And who has them if he has not received them from Him who says, <q>I will give them a heart to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me, and ears to hear?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153689"><a href="../bible/bar002.htm#verse31">Baruch&nbsp;2:31</a></span> Assuredly, he who has not received may reject; while, yet, he who receives may take and drink, may drink and live. For as <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> must be preached, that, by him who has ears to hear, God may be rightly worshipped; modesty must be preached, that, by him who has ears to hear, no illicit act may be perpetrated by his fleshly nature; charity must be preached, that, by him who has ears to hear, God and his neighbours may be loved;&mdash; so also must be preached such a <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of God's benefits that he who has ears to hear may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, not in himself, but in the Lord.</p>

<h2>Chapter 52.&mdash; Previous Writings Anticipatively Refuted the Pelagian Heresy.</h2>

<p>But in respect of their saying <q>that it was not necessary that the hearts of so many people of little intelligence should be disquieted by the uncertainty of this kind of disputation, since the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has been defended for so many years, with no less advantage, without this definition of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, as well against others as especially against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, in so many books that have gone before, as well of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and others as our own;</q> &mdash; I much wonder that they should say this, and not observe&mdash; to say nothing of other writings in this place&mdash; that those very treatises of mine were both composed and published before the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> had begun to appear; and that they do not see in how many passages of those treatises I was unawares cutting down a future Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, by preaching the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> delivers us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and from our habits, without any preceding merits of ours&mdash;doing this according to His gratuitous mercy. And this I began more fully to apprehend in that disputation which I wrote to Simplicianus, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Milan, of blessed memory, in the beginning of my <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, when, moreover, I both perceived and asserted that the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is God's gift.</p>

<h2>Chapter 53.&mdash; Augustine's <q>Confessions.</q></h2>

<p>And which of my smaller works has been able to be more generally and more agreeably <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> than the books of my <em> Confessions?</em> And although I published them before the Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> had come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, certainly in them I said to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said it frequently, <q>Give what You command, and command what You will.</q>  Which words of mine, Pelagius at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, when they were mentioned in his presence by a certain brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of mine, could not bear; and contradicting somewhat too excitedly, nearly came to a quarrel with him who had mentioned them. But what, indeed, does God primarily and chiefly command, but that we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him? And this, therefore, He Himself gives, if it is well said to Him, <q>Give what You command.</q> And, moreover, in those same books, in respect of what I have related concerning my conversion, when God converted me to that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which, with a most miserable and raging talkativeness, I was destroying, do you not remember that it was so narrated how I showed that I was granted to the faithful and daily tears of my mother, that I should not perish?  Where certainly I declared that God by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> converted to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the wills of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which were not only averse to it, but even adverse to it. Further, in what manner I besought God concerning my growth in perseverance, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and you are able to review if you wish it. Therefore, that all the gifts of God which in that work I either asked for or praised, were foreknown by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that He would give, and that He could never be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom He would give them, who can dare, I will not say to deny, but even to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>? This is the manifest and assured <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, which subsequently necessity compelled me more carefully and laboriously to defend when I was already disputing against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>. For I learned that each special <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> introduced its own peculiar questions into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>&mdash; against which the sacred Scripture might be more carefully defended than if no such necessity compelled their defence. And what compelled those passages of Scripture in which <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is commended to be defended more abundantly and clearly by that labour of mine, than the fact that the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> say that God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given according to our merits; for what else is this than an absolute denial of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 54 [XXI.]&mdash; Beginning and End of Faith is of God.</h2>

<p>Therefore that this opinion, which is unpleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and hostile to those gratuitous benefits of God whereby we are delivered, may be destroyed, I maintain that both the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the perseverance therein, even to the end, are, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>&mdash; of which I have already quoted many&mdash; God's gifts. Because if we say that the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is of ourselves, so that by it we deserve to receive other gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> conclude that God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is given according to our merits. And this the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> held in such dread, that Pelagius himself, in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of condemnation, condemned it. And, moreover, if we say that our perseverance is of ourselves, not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they answer that we have the beginning of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of ourselves in such wise as the end, thus arguing that we have that beginning of ourselves much more, if of ourselves we have the continuance unto the end, since to perfect is much greater than to begin; and thus repeatedly they conclude that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is given according to our merits. But if both are God's gifts, and God foreknew that He would give these His gifts (and who can deny this?), <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> must be preached&mdash;that God's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that is, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is not given according to our merits, may be maintained with insuperable defence.</p>

<h2>Chapter 55.&mdash; Testimony of His Previous Writings and Letters.</h2>

<p>And, indeed, in that treatise of which the title is, <em>Of Rebuke and Grace</em>,  which could not suffice for all my lovers, I think that I have so established that it is the gift of God also to persevere to the end, as I have either never before or almost never so expressly and evidently maintained this in writing, unless my memory deceives me. But I have now said this in a way in which no one before me has said it. Certainly the blessed Cyprian, in the Lord's Prayer, as I have already shown, so explained our petitions as to say that in its very first petition we were asking for perseverance, asserting that we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for it when we say, <q>Hallowed be Your name,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153694"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;6:9</a></span> although we have been already hallowed in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>&mdash;so that we may persevere in that which we have begun to be. Let those, however, to whom, in their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for me, I ought not to be ungrateful, who profess that they embrace, over and above that which comes into the argument, all my views, as you write&mdash;let those, I say, see whether, in the latter portions of the first book of those two which I wrote in the beginning of my <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, before the appearance of the Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, to Simplicianus, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Milan,  there remained anything whereby it might be called in question that God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not given according to our merits; and whether I have not there sufficiently argued that even the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is God's gift; and whether from what is there said it does not by consequence result, although it is not expressed, that even perseverance to the end is not given, except by Him who has <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> us to His kingdom and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Then, did not I many years ago publish that letter which I had already written to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">Paulinus</a>,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Nola, against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, which they have lately begun to contradict? Let them also look into that letter which I sent to Sixtus, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the Roman Church  when we contended in a very sharp conflict against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, and they will find it such as is that one to <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">Paulinus</a>. Whence they may gather that the same sort of things were already said and written several years ago against the Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and that it is to be wondered at that these should now displease them; although I should wish that no one would so embrace all my views as to follow me, except in those things in which he should see me not to have erred. For I am now writing treatises in which I have undertaken to retract my smaller works, for the purpose of demonstrating that even I myself have not in all things followed myself; but I think that, with God's mercy, I have written progressively, and not begun from perfection; since, indeed, I speak more arrogantly than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, if even now I say that I have at length in this age of mine arrived at perfection, without any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in what I write. But the difference is in the extent and the subject of an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and in the facility with which any one corrects it, or the pertinacity with which one endeavours to defend his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Certainly there is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> hope of that man whom the last day of this life shall find so progressing that whatever was wanting to his progress may be added to him, and that he should be adjudged rather to need perfecting than punishment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 56.&mdash; God Gives Means as Well as End.</h2>

<p>Wherefore if I am unwilling to appear ungrateful to men who have loved me, because some advantage of my labour has attained to them before they loved me, how much rather am I unwilling to be ungrateful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom we should not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> unless He had first loved us and made us to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him! since <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is of Him, <span class="stiki" id="note153698"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:7</a></span> as they have said whom He made not only His great lovers, but also His great preachers. And what is more ungrateful than to deny the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God itself, by saying that it is given to us according to our merits? And this the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shuddered at in the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, and this it objected to Pelagius himself as a capital crime; and this Pelagius himself condemned, not indeed from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but yet for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of his own condemnation. But whoever as a faithful catholic is horrified to say that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is given according to our merits, let him not withdraw <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself from God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereby he obtained mercy that he should be faithful; and thus let him attribute also perseverance to the end to God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereby he obtains the mercy which he daily asks for, not to be led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. But between the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the perfection of perseverance there are those means whereby we live righteously, which they themselves are agreed in regarding as given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to us at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And all these things&mdash; the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to wit, and His other gifts even to the end&mdash; God foreknew that He would bestow on His called. It is a matter therefore, of too excessive contentiousness to contradict <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 57 [XXII.]&mdash; How Predestination Must Be Preached So as Not to Give Offence.</h2>

<p>And yet this doctrine must not be preached to congregations in such a way as to seem to an unskilled multitude, or a people of slower understanding, to be in some measure confuted by that very preaching of it. Just as even the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which certainly men cannot deny, seems to be refuted if it be said to them, <q>Whether you run or sleep, you shall be that which He who cannot be deceived has foreknown you to be.</q> And it is the part of a deceitful or an unskilled physician so to compound even a useful medicament, that it either does no good or does harm. But it must be said, <q>So run that you may lay hold; <span class="stiki" id="note153699"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:24</a></span> and thus by your very running you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> yourselves to be foreknown as those who should run lawfully:</q> and in whatever other manner the foreknowledge of God may be so preached, that the slothfulness of man may be repulsed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 58.&mdash; The Doctrine to Be Applied with Discrimination.</h2>

<p>Now, therefore, the definite determination of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is of such a kind that some from unbelief receive the will to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, and are <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or persevere in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, while others who abide in the delight of damnable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, even if they have been <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, have not yet arisen, because the aid of pitying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has not yet lifted them up. For if any are not yet called whom by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> He has <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be elected, they will receive that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby they may will to be elected, and may be so; and if any <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, but have not been <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to His kingdom and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, they are for a season, and will not abide in the same <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the end. Although, then, these things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, yet they must not be so said to the multitude of hearers as that the address may be applied to themselves also, and those words of those people may be said to them which you have set down in your letter, and which I have above introduced: <q>The definite determination of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is of such a kind that some of you from unbelief shall receive the will to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, and come to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> What need is there for saying, <q>Some of you</q>? For if we speak to God's Church, if we speak to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, why do we say that <q>some of them</q> had come to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and seem to do a wrong to the rest, when we may more fittingly say the definite determination of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> is of such a kind that from unbelief you shall receive the will to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, and come to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and shall receive perseverance, and abide to the end?</p>

<h2>Chapter 59.&mdash; Offence to Be Avoided.</h2>

<p>Neither is what follows by any means to be said&mdash;that is, <q>But others of you who abide in the delight of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have not yet arisen, because the aid of pitying <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has not yet lifted you up;</q> when it may be and ought to be well and conveniently said, <q>But if any of you are still delaying in the delightfulness of damnable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, lay hold of the most wholesome discipline; and yet when you have done this be not lifted up, as if by your own works, nor boast as if you had not received this. For it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good will, <span class="stiki" id="note153700"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> and your steps are directed by the Lord, so that you choose His way.  But of your own good and righteous course, learn carefully that it is attributable to the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 60.&mdash; The Application to the Church in General.</h2>

<p>Moreover, what follows where it is said, <q>But yet if any of you are not yet called, whom by his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> He has <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be called, you shall receive that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby you shall will to be, and be, elected,</q> is said more hardly than it could be said if we consider that we are speaking not to men in general, but to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For why is it not rather said thus: <q>And if any of you are not yet called, let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them that they may be called. For perchance they are so <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> as to be granted to our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and to receive that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereby they may will, and be made elected</q>? For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who fulfilled all that He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, has willed us also to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that we might hence understand that He Himself also gives to the unbelievers the gift of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and makes willing men out of those that were unwilling.</p>

<h2>Chapter 61.&mdash; Use of the Third Person Rather Than the Second.</h2>

<p>But now I marvel if any weak brother among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> congregation can hear in any way with patience what is connected with these words, when it is said to them, <q>And if any of you <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, if you are <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be rejected, the power of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> will be withdrawn from you, that you may cease to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>.</q> For what does saying this seem, except to curse, or in a certain way to predict <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>? But if, however, it is desirable or necessary to say anything concerning those who do not persevere, why is it not rather at least said in such a way as was a little while ago said by me&mdash;first of all, so that this should be said, not of them who hear in the congregation, but about others to them; that is, that it should not be said, <q>If any of you <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, if you are <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be rejected,</q> but, <q>If any <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>,</q> and the rest, using the third person of the verb, not the second? For it is not to be said to be desirable, but abominable, and it is excessively harsh and hateful to fly as it were into the face of an audience with abuse, when he who speaks to them says, <q>And if there are any of you who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, and are <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be rejected, the power of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> shall be withdrawn from you, that you may cease to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>.</q> For what is wanting to the doctrine if it is thus expressed: <q>But if any <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, and are not <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to His kingdom and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, they are only for a season, and shall not continue in that <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> unto the end</q>? Is not the same thing said both more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and more fittingly, so that we may seem not as it were to be desiring so much for them, as to relate of others the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, and think does not belong to them, by hoping and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for better things? But in that manner in which they think that it must be said, the same judgment may be pronounced almost in the same words also of God's foreknowledge, which certainly they cannot deny, so as to say, <q>And if any of you <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, if you are foreknown to be rejected you shall cease to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>.</q> Doubtless this is very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, assuredly it is; but it is very monstrous, very inconsiderate, and very unsuitable, not by its false declaration, but by its declaration not wholesomely applied to the health of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 62.&mdash; Prayer to Be Inculcated, Nevertheless.</h2>

<p>But I do not think that manner which I have said should be adopted in the preaching of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> ought to be sufficient for him who speaks to the congregation, except he adds this, or something of this kind, saying, <q>You, therefore, ought also to hope for that perseverance in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> from the Father of Lights, from whom comes down every excellent gift and every perfect gift, <span class="stiki" id="note153702"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse17">James&nbsp;1:17</a></span> and to ask for it in your daily <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; and in doing this ought to trust that you are not aliens from the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of His people, because it is He Himself who bestows even the power of doing this. And far be it from you to despair of yourselves, because you are bidden to have your hope in Him, not in yourselves. For cursed is every one who has hope in man; <span class="stiki" id="note153703"><!--k28--<a href="../bible/jam017.htm#verse5">James&nbsp;17:5</a></span> and it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> rather to trust in the Lord than to trust in man, because blessed are all they that put their trust in Him.  Holding this hope, serve the Lord in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> unto Him with trembling.  Because no one can be certain of the life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who does not lie has promised to the children of promise before the times of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>&mdash;no one, unless that life of his, which is a state of trial upon the earth, is completed. <span class="stiki" id="note153706"><a href="../bible/job007.htm#verse1">Job&nbsp;7:1</a></span> But He will make us to persevere in Himself unto the end of that life, since we daily say to Him, 'Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.'</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153707"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;6:13</a></span> When these things and things of this kind are said, whether to few <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> or to the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, why do we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to preach the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;that is, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is not given according to our merits,&mdash; as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> declares it? Or, indeed, must it be feared that a man should then despair of himself when his hope is shown to be placed in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and should not rather despair of himself if he should, in his excess of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and unhappiness, place it in himself?</p>

<h2>Chapter 63 [XXIII.]&mdash; The Testimony of the Whole Church in Her Prayers.</h2>

<p>And I wish that those who are slow and weak of heart, who cannot, or cannot as yet, understand the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> or the explanations of them, would so hear or not hear our arguments in this question as to consider more carefully their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always used and will use, even from its beginnings until this age shall be completed. For of this matter, which I am now compelled not only to mention, but even to protect and defend against these new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has never been silent in its <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, although in its discourses it has not thought that it need be put forth, as there was no adversary compelling it. For when was not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> made in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for unbelievers and its opponents that they should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? When has any believer had a friend, a neighbour, a wife, who did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and has not asked on their behalf from the Lord for a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? And who has there ever been who has not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for himself that he might abide in the Lord? And who has dared, not only with his voice, but even in thought, to blame the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who invokes the Lord on behalf of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, if at any time he has said, <q>Give to them, O Lord, perseverance in You to the end!</q> and has not rather responded, over such a benediction of his, as well with confessing lips as believing heart, <q><a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a></q>? Since in the Lord's Prayer itself the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> do not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for anything else, especially when they say that petition, <q>Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>,</q> save that they may persevere in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. As, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has both been born and grows and has grown in these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, so it has been born and grows and has grown in this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not given according to the merits of the receivers. For, certainly, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should be given to unbelievers, unless it <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that God converts to Himself both the averse and adverse wills of men. Nor would the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that it might persevere in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not deceived nor overcome by the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of the world, unless it <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the Lord has our heart in His power, in such wise as that the good which we do not hold save by our own will, we nevertheless do not hold except He works in us to will also. For if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> indeed asks these things from Him, but thinks that the same things are given to itself by itself, it makes use of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but perfunctory,&mdash; which be far from us! For who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> groans, desiring to receive what he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for from the Lord, if he thinks that he receives it from himself, and not from the Lord?</p>

<h2>Chapter 64.&mdash; In What Sense the Holy Spirit Solicits for Us, Crying, Abba, Father.</h2>

<p>And this especially since <q>we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as we ought,</q> says the apostle, <q>but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered; and He that searches the hearts <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what is the mind of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, because He makes intercession for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153708"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse26">Romans&nbsp;3:26</a></span> What is <q>the Spirit Himself makes intercession,</q> but, <q>causes to make intercession,</q> <q>with groanings that cannot be uttered,</q> but <q>truthful,</q> since the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? For He it is of whom the apostle says in another place, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, <q>crying, Abba, Father!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153709"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;4:6</a></span> And here what is the meaning of <q>crying,</q> but <q>making to cry,</q> by that figure of speech whereby we call a day that makes people glad, a glad day? And this he makes plain elsewhere when he says, <q>For you have not received the Spirit of bondage again in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but you have received the Spirit of the adoption of sons, in whom we cry, Abba, Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153710"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;8:15</a></span> He there said, <q>crying,</q> but here, <q>in whom we cry;</q> opening up, that is to say, the meaning with which he said <q>crying,</q>&mdash; that is, as I have already explained, <q>causing to cry,</q> when we understand that this is also itself the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heart and spiritually we cry to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Let them, therefore, observe how they are mistaken who think that our seeking, asking, knocking is of ourselves, and is not given to us; and say that this is the case because <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is preceded by our merits; that it follows them when we ask and receive, and seek and find, and it is opened to us when we knock. And they will not understand that this is also of the divine gift, that we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; that is, that we ask, seek, and knock. For we have received the spirit of adoption of sons, in which we cry, Abba, Father. And this the blessed Ambrose also said.  For he says, <q>To <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to God also is the work of spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as it is written, No one says, Jesus is the Lord, but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 65.&mdash; The Church's Prayers Imply the Church's Faith.</h2>

<p>These things, therefore, which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> asks from the Lord, and always has asked from the time she began to exist, God so foreknew that He would give to His called, that He has already given them in <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> itself; as the apostle declares without any ambiguity. For, writing to Timothy, he says, <q>Labour along with the gospel according to the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who saves us, and calls us with His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the times of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, but is now made manifest by the coming of our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153712"><a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:8</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> Let him, therefore, say that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at any time has not had in its belief the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is now maintained with a more careful heed against the late <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; let him say this who dares to say that at any time it has not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, or not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfully</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, as well that unbelievers might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, as that <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> might persevere. And if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for these benefits, it has always <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> them to be certainly God's gifts; nor was it ever right for it to deny that they were foreknown by Him. And thus Christ's Church has never failed to hold the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of this <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, which is now being defended with new solicitude against these modern <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 66 [XXIV.]&mdash; Recapitulation and Exhortation.</h2>

<p>But what more shall I say? I think that I have taught sufficiently, or rather more than sufficiently, that both the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and continuance in the Lord unto the end, are God's gifts. And other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which pertain to a good life, whereby God is rightly worshipped, even they themselves on whose behalf I am writing this treatise concede to be God's gifts. Further, they cannot deny that God has foreknown all His gifts, and the people on whom He was going to bestow them. As, therefore, other things must be preached so that he who preaches them may be heard with <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, so <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> must be preached so that he who hears these things with <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> not in man, and therefore not in himself, but in the Lord; for this also is God's precept, and to hear this precept with <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>&mdash; to wit, that he who glories should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord <span class="stiki" id="note153713"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:31</a></span> &mdash; in like manner as the rest, is God's gift. And he who has not this gift,&mdash; I shrink not from saying it&mdash;whatever others he has, has them in vain. That the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> may have this we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and that our own brethren may have it more abundantly. Let us not, therefore, be prompt in arguments and indolent in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, dearly beloved, let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may give even to our enemies, and especially to our brethren and lovers, to understand and confess that after that great and unspeakable ruin wherein we have all fallen in one, no one is delivered save by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not repaid according to the merits of the receivers as if it were due, but is given freely as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, with no merits preceding.</p>

<h2>Chapter 67.&mdash; The Most Eminent Instance of Predestination is Christ Jesus.</h2>

<p>But there is no more illustrious instance of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> than Jesus Himself, concerning which also I have already argued in the former treatise;  and in the end of this I have chosen to insist upon it. There is no more eminent instance, I say, of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> than the Mediator Himself. If any believer wishes thoroughly to understand this doctrine, let him consider Him, and in Him he will find himself also. The believer, I say; who in Him believes and confesses the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that is our own, however singularly elevated by assumption by <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> into the only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, so that He who assumed, and what He assumed, should be one person in Trinity. For it was not a Quaternity that resulted from the assumption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but it remained a Trinity, inasmuch as that assumption ineffably made the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of one person in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Because we say that Christ was not only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the Manichean <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> contend; nor only man, as the Photinian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> assert; nor in such wise man as to have less of anything which of a certainty pertains to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>&mdash;whether a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself a rational <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or flesh not taken of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but made from the Word converted and changed into flesh&mdash;all which three false and empty notions have made the three various and diverse parties of the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; but we say that Christ was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father without any beginning of time; and that He was also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or very man, born of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mother in the certain fullness of time; and that His humanity, whereby He is less than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, does not diminish anything from His divinity, whereby He is equal to the Father. For both of them are One Christ&mdash; who, moreover, most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said in respect of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>I and the Father are one;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153715"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span> and most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said in respect of the man, <q>My Father is greater than I.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note153716"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;14:28</a></span> He, therefore, who made of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> this righteous man, who never should be unrighteous, without any merit of His preceding will, is the same who also makes righteous men of unrighteous, without any merit of their will preceding; that He might be the head, and they His members. He, therefore, who made that man with no precedent merits of His, neither to deduce from His origin nor to commit by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which should be remitted to Him, the same makes <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> on Him with no preceding merits of theirs, to whom He forgives all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. He who made Him such that He never had or should have an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will, the same makes in His members a good will out of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one. Therefore He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> both Him and us, because both in Him that He might be our head, and in us that we should be His body, He foreknew that our merits would not precede, but that His doings should.</p>

<h2>Chapter 68.&mdash; Conclusion.</h2>

<p>Let those who read this, if they understand, give God thanks, and let those who do not understand, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that they may have the inward Teacher, from whose presence comes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and understanding. <span class="stiki" id="note153717"><a href="../bible/pro002.htm#verse6">Proverbs&nbsp;2:6</a></span> But let those who think that I am in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, consider again and again carefully what is here said, lest perchance they themselves may be mistaken. And when, by means of those who read my writings, I become not only wiser, but even more perfect, I acknowledge God's favour to me; and this I especially look for at the hands of the teachers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if what I write comes into their hands, and they condescend to acknowledge it.</p>
