<h1>On the Priesthood (Book III)</h1>

<p>1. Chrysostom: As regards the insult to those who have done me <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, what I have already said might be sufficient to prove that in avoiding this office I had no desire to put them to shame; but I will now endeavor to make it evident, to the best of my ability, that I was not puffed up by arrogance of any kind. For if the choice of a generalship or a kingdom had been submitted to me, and I had then formed this resolution, any one might naturally have suspected me of this fault, or rather I should have been found guilty by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not of arrogance, but of senseless folly. But when the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is offered to me, which exceeds a kingdom as much as the spirit differs from the flesh, will any one dare to accuse me of disdain? And is it not preposterous to charge with folly those who reject small things, but when any do this in matters of pre-eminent importance, to exempt such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> from accusations of mental derangement, and yet subject them to the charge of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>? It is just as if one were to accuse, not of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, but of insanity, a man who looked with contempt on a herd of oxen and refused to be a herdsman, and yet were to say that a man who declined the empire of the world, and the command of all the armies of the earth, was not mad, but inflated with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. But this assuredly is not the case; and they who say such things do not injure me more than they injure themselves. For merely to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> it possible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to despise this dignity is an evidence against those who bring this charge of the estimate which they have formed of the office. For if they did not consider it to be an ordinary thing of no great account, such a suspicion as this would never have entered their heads. For why is it that no one has ever dared to entertain such a suspicion with reference to the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and to say that arrogance is the reason why <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> would not aspire to the rank of the angelic nature? It is because we <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> great things concerning those powers, and this does not suffer us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that a man can conceive anything greater than that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Wherefore one might with more <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> indite those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of arrogance who accuse me of it. For they would never have suspected this of others if they had not previously depreciated the matter as being of no account. But if they say that I have done this with a view to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, they will be convicted of fighting openly against themselves and falling into their own snare; for I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what kind of arguments they could have sought in preference to these if they had wished to release me from the charge of vainglory.</p>

<p>2. For if this desire had ever entered my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, I ought to have accepted the office rather than avoided it. Why? Because it would have brought me much <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For the fact that one of my age, who had so recently abandoned secular pursuits, should suddenly be deemed by all worthy of such admiration as to be advanced to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> before those who have spent all their life in labors of this kind, and to obtain more votes than all of them, might have persuaded all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to anticipate great and marvellous things of me. But, as it is, the greater part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me even by name: so that even my refusal of the office will not be manifest to all, but only to a few, and I am not sure that all even of these <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it for certain; but probably many of them either <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that I was not elected at all, or that I was rejected after the election, being considered unsuitable, not that I avoided the office of my own accord.</p>

<p>3. Basil: But those who do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will be surprised.</p>

<p>Chrysostom: And lo! These are they who, according to you, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accuse me of vainglory and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Whence then am I to hope for praise? From the many? They do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the actual fact. From the few? Here again the matter is perverted to my disadvantage. For the only reason why you have come here now is to learn what answer ought to be given to them. And what shall I now certainly say on account of these things? For wait a little, and you will clearly perceive that even if all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they ought not to condemn me for <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And in addition to this there is another consideration: that not only those who make this venture, if there be any such (which for my part I do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>), but also those who suspect it of others, will be involved in no small danger.</p>

<p>4. For the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office is indeed discharged on earth, but it ranks among heavenly ordinances; and very naturally so: for neither man, nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, nor archangel, nor any other created power, but the Paraclete Himself, instituted this vocation, and persuaded men while still abiding in the flesh to represent the ministry of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> ought to be as pure as if he were standing in the heavens themselves in the midst of those powers. Fearful, indeed, and of most awful import, were the things which were used before the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as the bells, the pomegranates, the stones on the breastplate and on the ephod, the girdle, the mitre, the long robe, the plate of gold, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies, the deep silence within.  But if any one should examine the things which belong to the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he will find that, small as they are, yet are they fearful and full of awe, and that what was spoken concerning the law is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in this case also, that <q>what has been made <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> has no <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in this respect by reason of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which excels.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190087"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:10</a></span> For when you see the Lord <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, and laid upon the altar,  and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> standing and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> over the victim, and all the worshippers empurpled with that precious blood,  can you then think that you are still among men, and standing upon the earth? Are you not, on the contrary, straightway translated to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and casting out every carnal thought from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, do you not with disembodied spirit and pure reason contemplate the things which are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>? Oh! What a marvel! What <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God to man! He who sits on high with the Father is at that hour held in the hands of all,  and gives Himself to those who are willing to embrace and grasp Him. And this all do through the eyes of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>!  Do these things seem to you fit to be despised, or such as to make it possible for any one to be uplifted against them?</p>

<p>Would you also learn from another <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> the exceeding <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of this office? Picture Elijah and the vast multitude standing around him, and the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> laid upon the altar of stones, and all the rest of the people hushed into a deep silence while the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> alone offers up <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: then the sudden rush of fire from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>:&mdash; these are marvellous things, charged with terror. Now then pass from this scene to the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> which are celebrated in the present day; they are not only marvellous to behold, but transcendent in terror. There stands the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, not bringing down fire from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>: and he makes prolonged supplication,  not that some flame sent down from on high may consume the offerings, but that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> descending on the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> may thereby enlighten the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all, and render them more refulgent than silver purified by fire. Who can despise this most awful <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, unless he is stark mad and senseless? Or do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could have endured that fire in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, but all would have been utterly consumed, had not the assistance of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> been great.</p>

<p>5. For if any one will consider how great a thing it is for one, being a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and compassed with flesh and blood, to be enabled to draw near to that blessed and pure nature, he will then clearly see what great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit has vouchsafed to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; since by their agency these <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> are celebrated, and others nowise inferior to these both in respect of our dignity and our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For they who inhabit the earth and make their abode there are entrusted with the administration of things which are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and have received an authority which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not given to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or archangels. For it has not been said to them, <q>Whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190093"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;18:18</a></span> They who rule on earth have indeed authority to bind, but only the body: whereas this binding lays hold of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and penetrates the heavens; and what <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> do here below God ratifies above, and the Master confirms the sentence of his servants. For indeed what is it but all manner of heavenly authority which He has given them when He says, <q>Whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye remit they are remitted, and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye retain they are retained?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190094"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;20:23</a></span> What authority could be greater than this? <q>The Father has committed all judgment to the Son?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190095"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;5:22</a></span> But I see it all put into the hands of these men by the Son. For they have been conducted to this dignity as if they were already translated to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and had transcended <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and were released from the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> to which we are liable. Moreover, if a king should bestow this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> upon any of his subjects, authorizing him to cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> whom he pleased and to release them again, he becomes an object of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and respect to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; but he who has received from God an authority as much greater as heaven is more precious than earth, and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> more precious than bodies, seems to some to have received so small an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> that they are actually able to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that one of those who have been entrusted with these things will despise the gift. Away with such <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>! For transparent <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> it is to despise so great a dignity, without which it is not possible to obtain either our own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which have been promised to us. For if no one can enter into the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> except he be regenerate through water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and he who does not eat the flesh of the Lord and drink His blood is excluded from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and if all these things are accomplished only by means of those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hands, I mean the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, how will any one, without these, be able to escape the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, or to win those crowns which are reserved for the victorious?</p>

<p>6. These verily are they who are entrusted with the pangs of spiritual travail and the birth which comes through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: by their means we put on Christ, and are buried with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and become members of that blessed Head. Wherefore they might not only be more <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> feared by us than rulers and kings, but also be more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> than <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; since these begot us of blood and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, but the others are the authors of our birth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even that blessed regeneration which is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> freedom and the sonship according to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. The Jewish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had authority to release the body from <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, or, rather, not to release it but only to examine those who were already released, and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how much the office of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was contended for at that time. But our <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have received authority to deal, not with bodily <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, but spiritual uncleanness&mdash; not to pronounce it removed after examination, but actually and absolutely to take it away. Wherefore they who despise these <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> would be far more accursed than Dathan and his company, and deserve more severe punishment. For the latter, although they laid claim to the dignity which did not belong to them, nevertheless had an excellent opinion concerning it, and this they evinced by the great eagerness with which they pursued it; but these men, when the office has been better regulated, and has received so great a development, have displayed an audacity which exceeds that of the others, although manifested in a contrary way. For there is not an equal amount of contempt involved in aiming at an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which does not pertain to one, and in despising such great advantages, but the latter exceeds the former as much as scorn differs from admiration. What <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> then is so sordid as to despise such great advantages? None whatever, I should say, unless it were one subject to some <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demoniacal</a> impulse. For I return once more to the point from which I started: not in the way of chastising only, but also in the way of benefiting, God has bestowed a power on <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> greater than that of our natural <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. The two indeed differ as much as the present and the future life. For our natural <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> generate us unto this life only, but the others unto that which is to come. And the former would not be able to avert death from their offspring, or to repel the assaults of disease; but these others have often saved a sick <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or one which was on the point of perishing, procuring for some a milder chastisement, and preventing others from falling altogether, not only by instruction and admonition, but also by the assistance wrought through <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. For not only at the time of regeneration, but afterwards also, they have authority to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. <q>Is any sick among you?</q> it is said, <q>let him call for the elders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and let them <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up: and if he have committed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they shall be forgiven him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190096"><a href="../bible/jam005.htm#verse14">James&nbsp;5:14-15</a></span> Again: our natural <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, should their children come into conflict with any men of high rank and great power in the world, are unable to profit them: but <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have reconciled, not rulers and kings, but God Himself when His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> has often been provoked against them.</p>

<p>Well! After this will any one venture to condemn me for arrogance? For my part, after what has been said, I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> such religious <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> will possess the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the hearers that they will no longer condemn those who avoid the office for arrogance and temerity, but rather those who voluntarily come forward and are eager to obtain this dignity for themselves. For if they who have been entrusted with the command of cities, should they chance to be wanting in discretion and vigilance, have sometimes destroyed the cities and ruined themselves in addition, how much power think you both in himself and from above must he need, to avoid sinning, whose business it is to beautify the Bride of Christ?</p>

<p>7. No man loved Christ more than <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: no man exhibited greater <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, no man was counted worthy of more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: nevertheless, after all these great advantages, he still has fears and tremblings concerning this government and those who were governed by him. <q>I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>,</q> he says, <q>lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190097"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3</a></span> And again, <q>I was with you in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and in much trembling;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190098"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:3</a></span> and this was a man who had been caught up to the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and made partaker of the unspeakable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note190099"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:4</a></span> and had endured as many deaths as he had lived days after he became a believer&mdash; a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, moreover, who would not use the authority given him from Christ lest any of his converts should be offended.  If, then, he who went beyond the ordinances of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and nowhere sought his own advantage, but that of those whom he governed, was always so full of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> when he considered the greatness of his government, what shall our condition be who in many ways seek our own, who not only fail to go beyond the commandments of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but for the most part transgress them? <q>Who is weak,</q> he says, <q>and I am not weak? Who is offended and I burn not?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190101"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse29">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:29</a></span> Such an one ought the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to be, or, rather, not such only: for these are small things, and as nothing compared with what I am about to say. And what is this? <q>I could wish,</q> he says, <q>that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190102"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;9:3</a></span> If any one can utter such a speech, if any one has the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which attains to such a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, he might <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> be blamed if he took to flight: but if any one should lack such excellence as much as I do, he would deserve to be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, not if he avoided the office, but if he accepted it. For if an election to a military dignity was the business in hand, and they who had the right of conferring the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> were to drag forward a brazier, or a shoemaker, or some such artisan, and entrust the army to his hands, I should not praise the wretched man if he did not take to flight, and do all in his power to avoid plunging into such manifest trouble. If, indeed, it be sufficient to bear the name of pastor, and to take the work in hand hap-hazard, and there be no danger in this, then let whoso pleases accuse me of vainglory; but if it behooves one who undertakes this care to have much understanding, and, before understanding, great <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and uprightness of conduct, and purity of life and superhuman <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, do not deprive me of forgiveness if I am unwilling to perish in vain without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, if any one in charge of a full-sized merchant ship, full of rowers, and laden with a costly freight, were to station me at the helm and bid me cross the &AElig;gean or the Tyrrhene sea, I should recoil from the proposal at once: and if any one asked me why? I should say, <q>Lest I should sink the ship.</q> Well, where the loss concerns material <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and the danger extends only to bodily death, no one will blame those who exercise great <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>; but where the shipwrecked are destined to fall, not into the ocean, but into the abyss of fire, and the death which awaits them is not that which severs the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body, but one which together with this dismisses it to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, shall I incur your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> because I did not plunge headlong into so great an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>?</p>

<p>8. Do not thus, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and beseech you. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, how feeble and puny it is: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the magnitude of this ministry, and the great difficulty of the work; for more stormy billows vex the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> than the gales which disturb the sea.</p>

<p>9. And first of all is that most terrible rock of vainglory, more dangerous than that of the Sirens, of which the fable-mongers tell such marvellous tales: for many were able to sail past that and escape unscathed; but this is to me so dangerous that even now, when no necessity of any kind impels me into that abyss, I am unable to keep clear of the snare: but if any one were to commit this charge to me, it would be all the same as if he tied my hands behind my back, and delivered me to the wild beasts dwelling on that rock to rend me in pieces day by day. Do you ask what those wild beasts are? They are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, despondency, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, strife, <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a>, accusations, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, hypocrisy, intrigues, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against those who have done no harm, pleasure at the indecorous acts of fellow ministers, sorrow at their prosperity, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of praise, desire of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> (which indeed most of all drives the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> headlong to perdition), doctrines devised to please, servile flatteries, ignoble fawning, contempt of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, paying court to the rich, senseless and mischievous <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, favors attended with danger both to those who offer and those who accept them, sordid <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> suited only to the basest of slaves, the abolition of plain speaking, a great affectation of humility, but banishment of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the suppression of convictions and reproofs, or rather the excessive use of them against the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, while against those who are invested with power no one dare open his lips.</p>

<p>For all these wild beasts, and more than these, are bred upon that rock of which I have spoken, and those whom they have once captured are inevitably dragged down into such a depth of servitude that even to please <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> they often do many things which it is well not to mention. The divine law indeed has excluded <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> from the ministry, but they endeavor to thrust themselves into it; and since they can effect nothing of themselves, they do all through the agency of others; and they have become invested with so much power that they can appoint or eject <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at their will:  things in fact are turned upside down, and the proverbial saying may be seen realized&mdash; <q>The ruled lead the rulers:</q> and would that it were men who do this instead of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who have not received a commission to teach. Why do I say teach? For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> did not suffer them even to speak in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  But I have heard some one say that they have obtained such a large privilege of free speech, as even to rebuke the prelates of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, and censure them more severely than masters do their own domestics.</p>

<p>10. And let not any one suppose that I subject all to the aforesaid charges: for there are some, yea many, who are superior to these entanglements, and exceed in number those who have been caught by them. Nor would I indeed make the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> responsible for these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>: far be such <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> from me. For men of understanding do not say that the sword is to blame for <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, nor wine for <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, nor strength for outrage, nor <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> for foolhardiness, but they lay the blame on those who make an improper use of the gifts which have been bestowed upon them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and punish them accordingly. Certainly, at least, the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> may <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> accuse us if we do not rightly handle it. For it is not itself a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> already mentioned, but we, who as far as lies in our power have defiled it with so many pollutions, by entrusting it to commonplace men who readily accept what is offered them, without having first acquired a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, or considered the gravity of the office, and when they have entered on the work, being blinded by inexperience, overwhelm with innumerable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> the people who have been committed to their care. This is the very thing which was very nearly happening in my case, had not God speedily delivered me from those dangers, mercifully sparing his Church and my own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For, tell me, whence do you think such great troubles are generated in the Churches? I, for my part, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the only source of them to be the inconsiderate and random way in which prelates are chosen and appointed. For the head ought to be the strongest part, that it may be able to regulate and control the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> exhalations which arise from the rest of the body below; but when it happens to be weak in itself, and unable to repel those pestiferous attacks, it becomes feebler itself than it really is, and ruins the rest of the body as well. And to prevent this now coming to pass, God kept me in the position of the feet, which was the rank originally assigned to me. For there are very many other qualities, Basil, besides those already mentioned, which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> ought to have, but which I do not possess; and, above all, this one:&mdash; his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> ought to be thoroughly purged from any <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after the office: for if he happens to have a natural inclination for this dignity, as soon as he attains it a stronger flame is kindled, and the man being taken completely captive will endure innumerable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> in order to keep a secure hold upon it, even to the extent of using flattery, or submitting to something base and ignoble, or expending large sums of money. For I will not now speak of the murders with which some have filled the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>,  or the desolation which they have brought upon cities in contending for the dignity, lest some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should think what I say incredible. But I am of opinion one ought to exercise so much caution in the matter, as to shun the burden of the office,  and when one has entered upon it, not to wait for the judgment of others should any fault be committed which warrants deposition, but to anticipate it by ejecting oneself from the dignity; for thus one might probably win mercy for himself from God: but to cling to it in defiance of propriety is to deprive oneself of all forgiveness, or rather to kindle the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by adding a second <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> more offensive than the first.</p>

<p>11. But no one will always endure the strain; for fearful, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> fearful is the eager desire after this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. And in saying this I am not in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, but in complete harmony with his words. For what says he? <q>If any man desires the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he desires a good work.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190107"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:1</a></span> Now I have not said that it is a terrible thing to desire the <em>work</em>, but only the authority and power. And this desire I think one ought to expel from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with all possible earnestness, not permitting it at the outset to be possessed by such a feeling, so that one may be able to do everything with freedom. For he who does not desire to be exhibited in possession of this authority, does not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> from it, and not fearing this will be able to do everything with the freedom which becomes <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> men: whereas they who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and tremble lest they should be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> undergo a bitter servitude, filled with all kinds of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and are often compelled to offend against both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> ought not to be affected in this way; but as in warfare we see those soldiers who are noble-spirited fight willingly and fall bravely, so they who have attained to this stewardship should be contented to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the dignity or removed from it, as becomes <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> men, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that deposition of this kind brings its reward no less than the discharge of the office. For when any one suffers anything of this kind, in order to avoid submitting to something which is unbecoming or unworthy of this dignity, he procures punishment for those who wrongfully depose him, and a greater reward for himself. <q>Blessed,</q> says our Lord, <q>are you when men shall revile you and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you, and shall say all manner of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against you <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> for my sake; <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190108"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;5:1</a></span> And this, indeed, is the case when any one is expelled by those of his own rank either on account of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, with a view to the favor of others, or through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, or from any other wrong motive: but when it is the lot of any one to experience this treatment at the hand of opponents, I do not think a word is needed to prove what great gain they confer upon him by their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</p>

<p>It behooves us, then, to be on the watch on all sides, and to make a careful search lest any spark of this desire should be secretly smouldering somewhere. For it is much to be wished that those who are originally free from this passion, should also be able to avoid it when they have lighted upon this office. But if any one, before he obtains the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, cherishes in himself this terrible and savage monster, it is impossible to say into what a furnace he will fling himself after he has attained it. Now I possessed this desire in a high degree (and do not suppose that I would ever tell you what was untrue in self-disparagement): and this, combined with other reasons, alarmed me not a little, and induced me to take flight. For just as lovers of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> person, as long as they are permitted to be near the objects of their affection, suffer more severe torment from their passion, but when they remove as far as possible from these objects of desire, they drive away the frenzy: even so when those who desire this dignity are near it, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> becomes intolerable: but when they cease to hope for it, the desire is extinguished together with the expectation.</p>

<p>12. This single motive then is no slight one: and even taken by itself it would have sufficed to deter me from this dignity: but, as it is, another must be added not less than the former. And what is this? A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> ought to be sober minded, and penetrating in discernment, and possessed of innumerable eyes in every direction, as one who lives not for himself alone but for so great a multitude. But that I am sluggish and slack, and scarcely able to bring about my own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, even you yourself would admit, who out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to me art especially eager to conceal my faults. Talk not to me in this connection of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and watching, or sleeping on the ground, and other hard discipline of the body: for you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how defective I am in these matters: and even if they had been carefully practised by me they could not with my present sluggishness have been of any service to me with a view to this post of authority. Such things might be of great service to a man who was shut up in a cell, and caring only for his own concerns: but when a man is divided among so great a multitude, and enters separately into the private cares of those who are under his direction, what appreciable help can be given to their improvement unless he possesses a robust and exceedingly vigorous character?</p>

<p>13. And do not be surprised if, in connection with such endurance, I seek another test of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For to be indifferent to food and drink and a soft bed, we see is to many no hard task, especially at least to such as are of a rough habit of life and have been brought up in this way from early youth, and to many others also; bodily discipline and custom softening the severity of these laborious practices: but insult, and abuse, and coarse language, and gibes from inferiors, whether wantonly or <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> uttered, and rebukes vainly and idly spoken both by rulers and the ruled&mdash; this is what few can bear, in fact only one or two here and there; and one may see men, who are strong in the former exercises, so completely upset by these things, as to become more <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> than the most savage beasts. Now such men especially we should exclude from the precincts of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. For if a prelate did not loathe food, or go barefoot, no harm would be done to the common interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but a <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> temper causes great disasters both to him who possesses it, and to his neighbours. And there is no divine threat against those who fail to do the things referred to, but <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell-fire</a> are threatened against those who are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note190109"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;5:22</a></span> As then the lover of vainglory, when he takes upon him the government of numbers, supplies additional fuel to the fire, so he who by himself, or in the company of a few, is unable to control his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but readily carried away by it, should he be entrusted with the direction of a whole multitude, like some wild beast goaded on all sides by countless tormentors, would never be able to live in tranquillity himself, and would <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> incalculable mischief to those who have been committed to his charge.</p>

<p>14. For nothing clouds the purity of the reason, and the perspicuity of the mental vision so much as undisciplined <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, rushing along with violent impetuosity. <q>For <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>,</q> says one, <q>destroys even the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>.</q>  For the eye of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being darkened as in some nocturnal battle is not able to distinguish friends from foes, nor the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> from the unworthy, but handles them all in turn in the same way; even if some harm must be suffered, readily enduring everything, in order to satisfy the pleasure of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the fire of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> is a kind of pleasure, and tyrannizes over the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> more harshly than pleasure, completely upsetting its healthy organization. For it easily impels men to arrogance, and unseasonable enmities, and unreasonable <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, and it continually makes them ready to commit wanton and vain offenses; and forces them to say and do many other things of that kind, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being swept along by the rush of passion, and having nothing on which to fasten its strength and resist so great an impulse.</p>

<p>Basil: I will not endure this irony of yours any longer: for who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not how far removed you are from this infirmity?</p>

<p>Chrysostom: Why then, my good friend, do you wish to bring me near the pyre, and to provoke the wild beast when he is tranquil? Are you not aware that I have achieved this condition, not by any innate <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but by my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of retirement? And that when one who is so constituted remains contented by himself, or only associates with one or two friends, he is able to escape the fire which arises from this passion, but not if he has plunged into the abyss of all these cares? For then he drags not only himself but many others with him to the brink of destruction, and renders them more indifferent to all consideration for mildness. For the mass of people under government are generally inclined to regard the manners of those who govern as a kind of model type, and to assimilate themselves to them. How then could any one put a stop to their fury when he is swelling himself with rage? And who among the multitude would straightway desire to become moderate when he sees the ruler irritable? For it is quite impossible for the defects of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to be concealed, but even trifling ones speedily become manifest. So an athlete, as long as he remains at home, and contends with no one, can dissemble his weakness even if it be very great, but when he strips for the contest he is easily detected. And thus for some who live this private and inactive life, their isolation serves as a veil to hide their defects; but when they have been brought into public they are compelled to divest themselves of this mantle of seclusion, and to lay bare their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to all through their visible movements. As therefore their right <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> profit many, by provoking them to equal <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, so their shortcomings make men more indifferent to the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and encourage them to indolence in their endeavours after what is excellent. Wherefore his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> ought to gleam with beauty on every side, that it may be able to gladden and to enlighten the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of those who behold it. For the faults of ordinary men, being committed as it were in the dark, ruin only those who practise them: but the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of a man in a conspicuous position, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to many, inflicts a common injury upon all, rendering those who have fallen more supine in their efforts for good, and driving to desperation those who wish to take heed to themselves. And apart from these things, the faults of insignificant men, even if they are exposed, inflict no injury worth speaking of upon any one: but they who occupy the highest seat of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> are in the first place plainly visible to all, and if they <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in the smallest matters these trifles seem great to others: for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> measure the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not by the magnitude of the offense, but by the rank of the offender. Thus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> ought to be protected on all sides by a kind of adamantine armour, by intense earnestness, and perpetual watchfulness concerning his manner of life, lest some one discovering an exposed and neglected spot should inflict a deadly wound: for all who surround him are ready to smite and overthrow him: not enemies only and adversaries, but many even of those who profess friendship.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> therefore of men elected to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> ought to be endued with such power as the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God bestowed on the bodies of those <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who were cast into the Babylonian furnace. <span class="stiki" id="note190111"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm">Daniel&nbsp;3</a></span> Faggot and pitch and tow are not the fuel of this fire, but things far more dreadful: for it is no material fire to which they are subjected, but the all-devouring flame of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> encompasses them, rising up on every side, and assailing them, and putting their life to a more searching test than the fire then was to the bodies of those young men. When then it finds a little trace of stubble, it speedily fastens upon it; and this unsound part it entirely consumes, but all the rest of the fabric, even if it be brighter than the sunbeams, is scorched and blackened by the smoke. For as long as the life of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is well regulated in every direction, it is invulnerable to plots; but if he happens to overlook some trifle, as is natural in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, traversing the treacherous ocean of this life, none of his other good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are of any avail in enabling him to escape the mouths of his accusers; but that little blunder overshadows all the rest. And all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are ready to pass judgment on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> as if he was not a being clothed with flesh, or one who inherited a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but like an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and emancipated from every species of infirmity. And just as all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and flatter a tyrant as long as he is strong, because they cannot put him down, but when they see his affairs going adversely, those who were his friends a short time before abandon their <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocritical</a> respect, and suddenly become his enemies and antagonists, and having discovered all his weak points, make an attack upon him, and depose him from the government; so is it also in the case of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Those who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> him and paid court to him a short time before, while he was strong, as soon as they have found some little handle eagerly prepare to depose him, not as a tyrant only, but something far more dreadful than that. And as the tyrant fears his body guards, so also does the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> dread most of all his neighbours and fellow-ministers. For no others <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> his dignity so much, or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his affairs so well as these; and if anything occurs, being near at hand, they perceive it before others, and even if they <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> him, can easily command belief, and, by magnifying trifles, take their victim captive. For the apostolic saying is reversed, <q>whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, all the members <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with it;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190112"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:26</a></span> unless indeed a man should be able by his great discretion to stand his ground against everything.</p>

<p>Are you then for sending me forth into so great a warfare? And did you think that my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> would be equal to a contest so various in character and shape? Whence did you learn this, and from whom? If God certified this to you, show me the oracle, and I <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>; but if you cannot, and form your judgment from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> opinion only, please to set yourself free from this delusion. For in what concerns my own affairs it is fairer to trust me than others; inasmuch as <q>no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, save the spirit of man which is in him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190113"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> That I should have made myself and my electors ridiculous, had I accepted this office, and should with great loss have returned to this condition of life in which I now am, I trust I have now convinced you by these remarks, if not before. For not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> only, but something much stronger&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after this dignity&mdash; is wont to arm many against one who possesses it. And just as avaricious children are oppressed by the old age of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, so some of these, when they see the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office held by any one for a protracted time&mdash; since it would be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> to destroy him&mdash; hasten to depose him from it, being all desirous to take his place, and each expecting that the dignity will be transferred to himself.</p>

<p>15. Would you like me to show you yet another phase of this strife, charged with innumerable dangers? Come, then, and take a peep at the public festivals when it is generally the custom for elections to be made to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> dignities, and you will then see the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> assailed with accusations as numerous as the people whom he rules. For all who have the privilege of conferring the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> are then split into many parties; and one can never find the council of elders  of one mind with each other, or about the man who has won the prelacy; but each stands apart from the others, one preferring this man, another that. Now the reason is that they do not all look to one thing, which ought to be the only object kept in view, the excellence of the character; but other qualifications are alleged as recommending to this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; for instance, of one it is said, <q>let him be elected because he belongs to an illustrious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>,</q> of another <q>because he is possessed of great <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and would not need to be supported out of the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,</q> of a third <q>because he has come over from the camp of the adversary;</q> one is eager to give the preference to a man who is on terms of intimacy with himself, another to the man who is related to him by birth, a third to the flatterer, but no one will look to the man who is really qualified, or make some test of his character. Now I am so far from thinking these things trustworthy criteria of a man's fitness for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, that even if any one manifested great <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, which is no small help in the discharge of that office, I should not venture to approve him on that account alone, unless he happened to combine good abilities with his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> many men who have exercised perpetual restraint upon themselves, and consumed themselves with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, who, as long as they were suffered to be alone, and attend to their own concerns, have been acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and day by day have made no small addition to this kind of learning; but as soon as they entered public life, and were compelled to correct the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the multitude, have, some of them, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the outset incompetent for so great a task, and others when forced to persevere in it, have abandoned their former strict way of living, and thus inflicted great injury on themselves without profiting others at all. And if any one spent his whole time in the lowest rank of the ministry, and reached extreme old age, I would not, merely out of reverence for his years, promote him to the higher dignity; for what if, after arriving at that time of life, he should still remain unfit for the office? And I say this now, not as wishing to dishonor the grey head, nor as laying down a law absolutely to exclude from this authority those who come from the monastic circle (for there are instances of many who issued from that body, having shone conspicuously in this dignity); but the point which I am anxious to prove is, that if neither <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of itself, nor advanced age, would suffice to show that a man who had obtained the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> really deserved it, the reasons formerly alleged would scarcely effect this. There are also men who bring forward other pretexts yet more absurd; for some are enrolled in the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, that they may not range themselves among opponents, and others on account of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> disposition, lest they should do great mischief if they are overlooked. Could anything be more contrary to right rule than this? That bad men, laden with iniquity, should be courted on account of those things for which they ought to be punished, and ascend to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dignity on account of things for which they ought to be debarred from the very threshold of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Tell me, then, shall we seek any further the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of God's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, when we expose things so <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and awful to be defiled by men who are either <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> or worthless? For when some men are entrusted with the administration of things which are not at all suitable to them, and others of things which exceed their natural power, they make the condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> like that of Euripus. </p>

<p>Now formerly I used to deride secular rulers, because in the distribution of their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> they are not guided by considerations of moral excellence, but of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and seniority, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> distinction; but when I heard that this kind of folly had forced its way into our affairs also, I no longer regarded their conduct as so atrocious. For what wonder is it that worldly men, who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the praise of the multitude, and do everything for the sake of gain, should commit these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, when those who affect at least to be free from all these influences are in no wise better disposed than they, but although engaged in a contest for heavenly things, act as if the question submitted for decision was one which concerned acres of land, or something else of that kind? For they take commonplace men off-hand, and set them to preside over those things, for the sake of which the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not refuse to empty Himself of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and become man, and take the form of a servant, and be spat upon, and buffeted, and die a death of reproach in the flesh. Nor do they stop even here, but add to these offenses others still more monstrous; for not only do they elect unworthy men, but actually expel those who are well qualified. As if it were necessary to ruin the safety of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on both sides, or as if the former provocation were not sufficient to kindle the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they have contrived yet another not less pernicious. For I consider it as atrocious to expel the useful men as to force in the useless. And this in fact takes place, so that the flock of Christ is unable to find consolation in any direction, or draw its breath freely. Now do not such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> deserve to be punished by ten thousand thunder-bolts, and a <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell-fire</a> hotter than that with which we are threatened [in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>]? Yet these monstrous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are borne with by Him who wills not the death of a sinner, that he may be converted and live. And how can one sufficiently marvel at His lovingkindness, and be amazed at His mercy? They who belong to Christ destroy the property of Christ more than enemies and adversaries, yet the good Lord still deals gently with them, and calls them to repentance. Glory be to You, O Lord! Glory to You! How vast is the depth of Your lovingkindness! How great the riches of Your forbearance! Men who on account of Your name have risen from insignificance and obscurity to positions of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and distinction, use the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> they enjoy against Him who has bestowed it, do <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of outrageous audacity, and insult <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, rejecting and expelling men of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in order that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> may ruin everything at their pleasure in much security, and with the utmost fearlessness. And if you would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the causes of this dreadful <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, you will find that they are similar to those which were mentioned before; for they have one root and mother, so to say&mdash; namely, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>; but this is manifested in several different forms. For one we are told is to be struck out of the list of candidates, because he is young; another because he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to flatter; a third because he has offended such and such a person; a fourth lest such and such a man should be pained at seeing one whom he has presented rejected, and this man elected; a fifth because he is kind and gentle; a sixth because he is formidable to the sinful; a seventh for some other like reason; for they are at no loss to find as many pretexts as they want, and can even make the abundance of a man's <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> an objection when they have no other. Indeed they would be capable of discovering other reasons, as many as they wish, why a man ought not to be brought suddenly to this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, but gently and gradually. And here I should like to ask the question, <q>What, then, is the prelate to do, who has to contend with such blasts? How shall he hold his ground against such billows? How shall he repel all these assaults?</q></p>

<p>For if he manages the business  upon upright principles, all those who are enemies and adversaries both to him and to the candidates do everything with a view to contention, provoking daily strife, and heaping <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> scorn upon the candidates, until they have got them struck off the list, or have introduced their own favorites. In fact it is just as if some pilot had pirates sailing with him in his ship, perpetually plotting every hour against him, and the sailors, and marines. And if he should prefer favor with such men to his own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, accepting unworthy candidates, he will have God for his enemy in their stead; and what could be more dreadful than that? And yet his relations with them will be more embarrassing than formerly, as they will all combine with each other, and thereby become more powerful than before. For as when fierce winds coming from opposite directions clash with one another, the ocean, hitherto calm, becomes suddenly <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> and raises its crested waves, destroying those who are sailing over it, so also when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has admitted corrupt men, its once tranquil surface is covered with rough surf and strewn with shipwrecks.</p>

<p>16. Consider, then, what kind of man he ought to be who is to hold out against such a tempest, and to manage skillfully such great hindrances to the common welfare; for he ought to be dignified yet free from arrogance, formidable yet kind, apt to command yet sociable, impartial yet courteous, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> yet not servile, strong yet gentle, in order that he may contend successfully against all these difficulties. And he ought to bring forward with great authority the man who is properly qualified for the office, even if all should oppose him, and with the same authority to reject the man who is not so qualified, even if all should conspire in his favor, and to keep one aim only in view, the building up of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in nothing actuated either by enmity or favor. Well, do you now think that I acted reasonably in declining the ministry of this office? But I have not even yet gone through all my reasons with you; for I have some others still to mention. And do not grow impatient of listening to a friendly and sincere man, who wishes to clear himself from your accusations; for these statements are not only serviceable for the defence which you have to make on my behalf, but they will also prove of no small help for the due administration of the office. For it is necessary for one who is going to enter upon this path of life to investigate all matters thoroughly well, before he sets his hand to the ministry. Do you ask why? Because one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things clearly will have this advantage, if no other, that he will not feel strange when these things befall him. Would you like me then to approach the question of superintending <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, first of all, or of the care of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, or the difficulty of the judicial function. For in each of these cases there is a different kind of anxiety, and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is greater than the anxiety.</p>

<p>Now in the first place, to start from that subject which seems to be simpler than the others, the charge of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> appears to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> anxiety to those who take care of them only so far as the expenditure of money is concerned; but the case is otherwise, and here also a careful scrutiny is needed, when they have to be enrolled,  for <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> mischief has been caused by putting them on the list without due discrimination. For they have ruined households, and severed marriages, and have often been detected in thieving and pilfering and unseemly <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of that kind. Now that such <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> should be supported out of the Church's revenues provokes punishment from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and extreme condemnation among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and abates the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of those who wish to do good. For who would ever choose to expend the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> which he was commanded to give to Christ upon those who defame the name of Christ? For these reasons a strict and accurate scrutiny ought to be made so as to prevent the supply of the indigent being wasted, not only by the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> already mentioned, but also by those who are able to provide for themselves. And this scrutiny is succeeded by no small anxiety of another kind, to ensure an abundant and unfailing stream of supply as from a fountain; for compulsory poverty is an insatiable kind of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, querulous and ungrateful. And great discretion and great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> is required so as to stop the mouths of complainers, depriving them of every excuse. Now most men, when they see any one superior to the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>, immediately represent him as well qualified for this stewardship. But I do not think that this greatness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is ever sufficient of itself, although it ought to be possessed prior to all other qualities; for without this a man would be a destroyer rather than a protector, a wolf instead of a shepherd; nevertheless, combined with this, the possession of another quality also should be demanded. And this quality is forbearance, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in men, impelling as it were and conducting the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into a serene haven. For <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> are a class who, both on account of their poverty, their age and natural disposition,  indulge in unlimited freedom of speech (so I had best call it); and they make an unseasonable clamor and idle complaints and lamentations about matters for which they ought to be grateful, and bring accusations concerning things which they ought contentedly to accept. Now the superintendent should endure all these things in a generous spirit, and not be provoked either by their unreasonable annoyance or their unreasonable complaints. For this class of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> deserve to be pitied for their misfortunes, not to be insulted; and to trample upon their calamities, and add the pain of insult to that which poverty brings, would be an act of extreme brutality. On this account one of the wisest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, having regard to the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and considering the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of poverty and its terrible power to depress even the noblest character, and induce it often to act in these same respects without shame, in order that a man should not be irritated when accused, nor be provoked by continual importunity to become an enemy where he ought to bring aid, he instructs him to be affable and accessible to the suppliant, saying, <q>Incline your ear to a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man and give him a friendly answer with meekness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190118"><a href="../bible/sir004.htm#verse8">Sirach&nbsp;4:8</a></span> And passing by the case of one who succeeds in exasperating (for what can one say to him who is overcome?), he addresses the man who is able to bear the other's infirmity, exhorting him before he bestows his gift to correct the suppliant by the gentleness of his countenance and the mildness of his words. But if any one, although he does not take the property (of these <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>), nevertheless loads them with innumerable reproaches, and insults them, and is exasperated against them, he not only fails through his gift to alleviate the despondency produced by poverty, but aggravates the distress by his abuse. For although they may be compelled to act very shamelessly through the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of hunger, they are nevertheless distressed at this compulsion. When, then, owing to the dread of famine, they are constrained to beg, and owing to their begging are constrained to put off shame, and then again on account of their shamelessness are insulted, the power of despondency becoming of a complex kind, and accompanied by much gloom, settles down upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And one who has the charge of these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> ought to be so long-suffering, as not only not to increase their despondency by his fits of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but also to remove the greater part of it by his exhortation. For as the man who has been insulted, although he is in the enjoyment of great abundance, does not feel the advantage of his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, on account of the blow which he has received from the insult; so on the other hand, the man who has been addressed with kindly words, and for whom the gift has been accompanied with encouragement, exults and rejoices all the more, and the thing given becomes doubled in value through the manner in which it is offered. And this I say not of myself, but borrow from him whose precept I quoted just now: <q>My son, blemish not your good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, neither use uncomfortable words when you give anything. Shall not the dew assuage the heat? So is a word better than a gift. Lo! Is not a word better than a gift? But both are with a gracious man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190119"><a href="../bible/sir018.htm#verse15">Sirach&nbsp;18:15-17</a></span> </p>

<p>But the superintendent of these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> ought not only to be gentle and forbearing, but also skillful in the management of property; for if this qualification is wanting, the affairs of the poor are again involved in the same distress. One who was entrusted not long ago with this ministry, and got together a large hoard of money, neither consumed it himself, nor expended it with a few exceptions upon those who needed it, but kept the greater part of it buried in the earth until a season of distress occurred, when it was all surrendered into the hands of the enemy. Much forethought, therefore, is needed, that the resources of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be neither over abundant, nor deficient, but that all the supplies which are provided should be quickly distributed among those who require them, and the treasures of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> stored up in the hearts of those who are under her rule.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the reception of strangers, and the care of the sick, consider how great an expenditure of money is needed, and how much exactness and discernment on the part of those who preside over these matters. For it is often necessary that this expenditure should be even larger than that of which I spoke just now, and that he who presides over it should combine <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and wisdom with skill in the art of supply, so as to dispose the affluent to be emulous and ungrudging in their gifts, lest while providing for the relief of the sick, he should vex the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of those who supply their wants. But earnestness and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> need to be displayed here in a far higher degree; for the sick are difficult creatures to please, and prone to languor; and unless great accuracy and care are used, even a slight oversight is enough to do the patient great mischief.</p>

<p>17. But in the care of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is greater in proportion as the possession is more precious, and this flock is of a nobler character than the others. Already, indeed, even into the band of these <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ones, an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> have rushed full of innumerable bad qualities; and in this case our grief is greater than in the other; for there is just the same difference between a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> going astray, as between a free-born damsel and her handmaid. With <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, indeed, it has become a common practice to trifle, and to rail at one another, to flatter or to be impudent, to appear everywhere in public, and to perambulate the market-place. But the virgin has striven for nobler aims, and eagerly sought the highest kind of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>,  and professes to exhibit upon earth the life which <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> lead, and while yet in the flesh proposes to do <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which belong to the incorporeal powers. Moreover, she ought not to make numerous or unnecessary journeys, neither is it permissible for her to utter idle and random words; and as for abuse and flattery, she should not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them by name. On this account she needs the most careful guardianship, and the greater assistance. For the enemy of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> is always surprising and lying in wait for these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, ready to devour any one of them if she should slip and fall; many men also there are who lay snares for them; and besides all these things there is the passionateness of their own <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so that, speaking generally, the virgin has to equip herself for a twofold <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, one which attacks her from without, and the other which presses upon her from within. For these reasons he who has the superintendence of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> suffers great alarm, and the danger and distress is yet greater, should any of the things which are contrary to his wishes occur, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid. For if a daughter kept in seclusion is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of sleeplessness to her father, his anxiety about her depriving him of sleep, where the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is so great lest she should be childless, or pass the flower of her age (unmarried), or be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> (by her husband), <span class="stiki" id="note190121"><a href="../bible/sir042.htm#verse9">Sirach&nbsp;42:9</a></span> what will he suffer whose anxiety is not concerned with any of these things, but others far greater? For in this case it is not a man who is rejected, but Christ Himself, nor is this barrenness the subject merely of reproach, but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ends in the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; <q>for every tree,</q> it is said, <q>which brings not forth good fruit, is hewn down and cast into the fire.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190122"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;3:10</a></span> And for one who has been repudiated by the divine Bridegroom, it is not sufficient to receive a certificate of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> and so to depart, but she has to pay the penalty of everlasting punishment. Moreover, a father according to the flesh has many things which make the custody of his daughter easy; for the mother, and nurse, and a multitude of handmaids share in helping the parent to keep the maiden safe. For neither is she permitted to be perpetually hurrying into the market-place, nor when she does go there is she compelled to show herself to any of the passers-by, the evening darkness concealing one who does not wish to be seen no less than the walls of the house. And apart from these things, she is relieved from every <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which might otherwise compel her to meet the gaze of men; for no anxiety about the necessaries of life, no menaces of oppressors, nor anything of that kind reduces her to this unfortunate necessity, her father acting in her stead in all these matters; while she herself has only one anxiety, which is to avoid doing or saying anything unworthy the modest conduct which becomes her. But in the other case there are many things which make the custody of the virgin difficult, or rather impossible for the father; for he could not have her in his house with himself, as dwelling together in that way would be neither seemly nor safe. For even if they themselves should suffer no loss, but continue to preserve their innocence unsullied, they would have to give an account for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which they have offended, just as much as if they happened to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with one another. And it being impossible for them to live together, it is not easy to understand the movements of the character, and to suppress the impulses which are ill regulated, or train and improve those which are better ordered and tuned. Nor is it an easy thing to interfere in her habits of walking out; for her poverty and want of a guardian does not permit him to become an exact investigator of the propriety of her conduct. For as she is compelled to manage all her affairs she has many pretexts for going out, if at least she is not inclined to be self-controlled. Now he who commands her to stay always at home ought to cut off these pretexts, providing for her independence in the necessaries of life, and giving her some <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who will see to the management of these things. He must also keep her away from funeral obsequies, and nocturnal festivals; for that artful serpent <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> only too well how to scatter his poison through the medium even of good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. And the maiden must be fenced on every side, and rarely go out of the house during the whole year, except when she is constrained by inexorable necessity. Now if any one should say that none of these things is the proper work of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to take in hand, let him be assured that the anxieties and the reasons concerning what takes place in every case have to be referred to him. And it is far more expedient that he should manage everything, and so be delivered from the complaints which he must otherwise undergo on account of the faults of others, than that he should abstain from the management, and then have to dread being called to account for things which other men have done. Moreover, he who does these things by himself, gets through them all with great ease; but he who is compelled to do it by converting every one's opinion does not get relief by being saved from working single-handed, equivalent to the trouble and turmoil which he experiences through those who oppose him and combat his decisions. However, I could not enumerate all the anxieties concerned with the care of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>; for when they have to be entered on the list, they occasion no small trouble to him who is entrusted with this business.</p>

<p>Again, the judicial department of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> office involves innumerable vexations, great consumption of time, and difficulties exceeding those experienced by men who sit to judge secular affairs; for it is a labor to discover exact <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and when it is found, it is difficult to avoid destroying it. And not only loss of time and difficulty are incurred, but also no small danger. For ere now, some of the weaker brethren having plunged into business, because they have not obtained patronage have made shipwreck concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For many of those who have suffered wrong, no less than those who have inflicted wrong, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> those who do not assist them, and they will not take into account either the intricacy of the matters in question, or the difficulty of the times, or the limits of sacerdotal authority, or anything of that kind; but they are merciless judges, recognizing only one kind of defence&mdash; release from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which oppress them. And he who is unable to furnish this, although he may allege innumerable excuses, will never escape their condemnation.</p>

<p>And talking of patronage, let me disclose another pretext for fault-finding. For if the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> does not pay a round of visits every day, more even than the idle men about town, unspeakable offense ensues. For not only the sick, but also the whole, desire to be looked after, not that <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> prompts them to this, but rather that in most cases they pretend claims to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and distinction. And if he should ever happen to visit more constantly one of the richer and more powerful men, under the pressure of some necessity, with a view to the common benefit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he is immediately stigmatized with a character for fawning and flattery. But why do I speak of patronage and visiting? For merely from their mode of accosting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have to endure such a load of reproaches as to be often oppressed and overwhelmed by despondency; in fact, they have also to undergo a scrutiny of the way in which they use their eyes. For the public rigorously criticize their simplest actions, taking note of the tone of their voice, the cast of their countenance, and the degree of their laughter. He laughed heartily to such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, one will say, and accosted him with a beaming face, and a clear voice, whereas to me he addressed only a slight and passing remark. And in a large assembly, if he does not turn his eyes in every direction when he is conversing, the majority declare that his conduct is insulting.</p>

<p>Who, then, unless he is exceedingly strong, could cope with so many accusers, so as either to avoid being indited altogether, or, if he is indited, to escape? For he must either be without any accusers, or, if this is impossible, purge himself of the accusations which are brought against him; and if this again is not an easy matter, as some men delight in making vain and wanton charges, he must make a brave stand against the dejection produced by these complaints. He, indeed, who is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> accused, may easily tolerate the accuser, for there is no bitterer accuser than <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; wherefore, if we are caught first by this most terrible adversary, we can readily endure the milder ones who are external to us. But he who has no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing upon his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, when he is subjected to an empty charge, is speedily excited to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and easily sinks into dejection, unless he happens to have practised beforehand how to put up with the follies of the multitude. For it is utterly impossible for one who is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accused without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and condemned, to avoid feeling some vexation and annoyance at such great <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.</p>

<p>And how can one speak of the distress which <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> undergo, whenever it is necessary to cut some one off from the full communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? Would indeed that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> went no further than distress! But in fact the mischief is not trifling. For there is a <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest the man, if he has been punished beyond what he deserves, should experience that which was spoken of by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> and <q>be swallowed up by overmuch sorrow.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190123"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> The nicest accuracy, therefore, is required in this matter also, lest what is intended to be profitable should become to him an occasion of greater damage. For whatever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> he may commit after such a method of treatment, the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> caused by each of them must be shared by the physician who so unskillfully applied his knife to the wound. What severe punishment, then, must be expected by one who has not only to render an account of the offenses which he himself has separately committed, but also incurs extreme danger on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed by others? For if we shudder at undergoing judgment for our own misdeeds, believing that we shall not be able to escape the fire of the other world, what must one expect to suffer who has to answer for so many others? To prove the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this, listen to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, or rather not to him, but to Christ speaking in him, when he says: <q>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit, for they watch for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> as they that shall give account.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190124"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse17">Hebrews&nbsp;13:17</a></span> Can the dread of this threat be slight? It is impossible to say: but these considerations are sufficient to convince even the most incredulous and obdurate that I did not make this escape under the influence of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or vainglory, but merely out of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for my own safety, and consideration of the gravity of the office.</p>
