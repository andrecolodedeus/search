<h1>On the Sole Government of God</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. Object of the author</h2>

<p>Although <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> at first received a union of intelligence and safety to discern the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the worship due to the one Lord of all, yet <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, insinuating the excellence of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> greatness, turned men away to the making of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; and this superstitious custom, after continuing for a long period, is handed down to the majority as if it were natural and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. It is the part of a lover of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or rather of a lover of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to remind men who have neglected it of that which they ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is of itself sufficient to show forth, by means of those things which are contained under the pole of heaven, the order [instituted by] Him who has created them. But forgetfulness having taken possession of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, through the long-suffering of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has acted recklessly in transferring to mortals the name which is applicable to the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and from the few the infection of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> spread to the many, who were blinded by popular usage to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that which was lasting and unchangeable. For the men of former generations, who instituted private and public <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of such as were more powerful, caused forgetfulness of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>  <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to take possession of their posterity; but I, as I have just stated, along with a God-loving <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, shall employ the speech of one who loves man, and set it before those who have intelligence, which all ought to have who are privileged to observe the administration of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, so that they should worship unchangeably Him who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things. This I shall do, not by mere display of words, but by altogether using demonstration drawn from the old poetry in Greek literature,  and from writings very common among all. For from these the famous men who have handed down idol-worship as law to the multitudes, shall be taught and convicted by their own poets and literature of great <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Testimonies to the unity of God</h2>

<p>First, then, &AElig;schylus,  in expounding the arrangement of his work,  expressed himself also as follows respecting the only God:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Afar from mortals place the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,<br>Nor ever think that He, like to yourself,<br>In fleshly robes is clad; for all unknown<br>Is the great God to such a worm as you.<br>Divers similitudes He bears; at times<br>He seems as a consuming fire that burns<br>Unsated; now like water, then again<br>In sable folds of darkness shrouds Himself.<br>Nay, even the very beasts of earth reflect<br>His sacred image; while the wind, clouds, rain,<br>The roll of thunder and the lightning flash,<br>Reveal to men their great and sovereign Lord.<br>Before Him sea and rocks, with every fount,<br>And all the water floods, in reverence bend;<br>And as they gaze upon His awful face,<br>Mountains and earth, with the profoundest depths<br>Of ocean, and the highest peaks of hills,<br>Tremble: for He is Lord Omnipotent;<br>And this the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is of God Most High.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>But he was not the only man initiated in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for Sophocles also thus describes the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the only Creator of all things, the One God:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>There is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> there is but one,<br>Who made the heavens and the broad earth beneath,<br>The glancing waves of ocean, and the winds;<br>But many of us mortals <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in heart,<br>And set up, for a solace in our woes,<br>Images of the gods in stone and brass,<br>Or figures carved in gold or ivory;<br>And, furnishing for these, our handiworks,<br>Both <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and rite magnificent,<br>We think that thus we do a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> work.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Philemon also, who published many explanations of ancient customs, shares in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and thus he writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Tell me what thoughts of God we should conceive?<br>One, all things seeing, yet Himself unseen.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Even Orpheus, too, who introduces three hundred and sixty gods, will bear testimony in my  favour from the tract called <em>Diathec&aelig;</em>, in which he appears to repent of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by writing the following:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>I'll speak to those who lawfully may hear;<br>All others, you profane, now close the doors!<br>And, O Mus&aelig;us, hearken to me,<br>Whose offspring are of the light-bringing moon.<br>The words I tell you now are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> indeed,<br>And if you former thoughts of mine has seen,<br>Let them not rob you of the blessed life;<br>But rather turn the depths of your own heart<br>Unto that place where light and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> dwell.<br>Take the word divine to guide your steps;<br>And walking well in the straight certain path,<br>Look to the one and universal King,<br>One, self-begotten, and the only One<br>Of whom all things, and we ourselves, are sprung.<br>All things are open to His piercing gaze,<br>While He Himself is still invisible;<br>Present in all His works, though still unseen,<br>He gives to mortals <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> out of good,<br>Sending both chilling <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and tearful griefs;<br>And other than the Great King there is none.<br>The clouds for ever settle round His throne;<br>And mortal eyeballs in mere mortal eyes<br>Are weak to see Jove, reigning over all.<br>He sits established in the brazen heavens<br>Upon His throne; and underneath His feet<br>He treads the earth, and stretches His right hand<br>To all the ends of ocean, and around<br>Tremble the mountain ranges, and the streams,<br>The depths, too, of the blue and hoary sea.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>He speaks indeed as if he had been an eyewitness of God's greatness. And Pythagoras  agrees with him when he writes:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Should one in boldness say, Lo, I am God!<br>Besides the One&mdash; Eternal&mdash; Infinite,<br>Then let him from the throne he has usurped<br>Put forth his power and form another globe,<br>Such as we dwell in, saying, This is mine.<br>Nor only so, but in this new domain<br>For ever let him dwell. If this he can,<br>Then verily he is a god proclaimed.</q></p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 3. Testimonies to a future judgment</h2>

<p>Then further concerning Him, that He alone is powerful, both to institute judgment on the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> performed in life, and on the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the Deity [displayed by men], I can adduce witnesses from your own ranks; and first Sophocles,  who speaks as follows:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>That time of times shall come, shall surely come,<br>When from the golden ether down shall fall<br>Fire's teeming treasure, and in burning flames<br>All things of earth and heaven shall be consumed;<br>And then, when all creation is dissolved,<br>The sea's last wave shall die upon the shore,<br>The bald earth stript of trees, the burning air<br>No winged thing upon its breast shall bear.<br>There are two roads to Hades, well we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>;  <br>By this the righteous, and by that the bad,<br>On to their separate fates shall tend; and He,<br>Who all things had destroyed, shall all things save.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Philemon  again:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Do you think, Nicostratus, the dead, who here<br>Enjoyed whate'er of good life often man,<br>Escape the notice of Divinity,<br>As if they might forgotten be of Him?<br>Nay, there's an eye of Justice watching all;<br>For if the good and bad find the same end,<br>Then go, rob, steal, plunder, at your will,<br>Do all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that to you seems good.<br>Yet be not deceived; for underneath<br>There is a throne and place of judgment set,<br>Which God the Lord of all shall occupy;<br>Whose name is terrible, nor shall I dare<br>To breathe it forth in feeble <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> speech.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Euripides: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Not grudgingly he gives a lease of life,<br>That we the holders may be fairly judged;<br>And if a mortal man does think to hide<br>His daily guilt from the keen eye of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,<br>It is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thought; so if perchance<br>He meets with leisure-taking Justice, she<br>Demands him as her lawful prisoner:<br>But many of you hastily commit<br>A twofold <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and say there is no God.<br>But, ah! There is; there is. Then see that he<br>Who, being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, prospers, may redeem<br>The time so precious, else hereafter waits<br>For him the due reward of punishment.</q></p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 4. God desires not sacrifices, but righteousness</h2>

<p>And that God is not appeased by the libations and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of evil-doers, but awards vengeance in righteousness to each one, Philemon  again shall bear testimony to me:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>If any one should dream, O Pamphilus,<br>By <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of bulls or goats&mdash; nay, then,<br>By Jupiter&mdash; of any such like things;<br>Or by presenting gold or purple robes,<br>Or images of ivory and gems;<br>If thus he thinks he may propitiate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,<br>He <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a>, and shows himself a silly one.<br>But let him rather useful be, and good,<br>Committing neither theft nor lustful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>,<br>Nor <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> foul, for earthly riches' sake.<br>Let him of no man <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> wife or child,<br>His splendid house, his wide-spread property,<br>His maiden, or his slave born ill his house,<br>His horses, or his cattle, or his beeves,<br>Nay, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> not a pin, O Pamphilus,<br>For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, close by you, sees whate'er you do.<br>He ever with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>,<br>But in the righteous takes a pleasure still,<br>Permitting him to reap fruit of his toil,<br>And to enjoy the bread his sweat has won.<br>But being righteous, see that you pay your vows,<br>And unto God the giver offer gifts.<br>Place your adorning not in outward shows,<br>But in an inward purity of heart;<br>Hearing the thunder then, you shall not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>,<br>Nor shall you flee, O master, at its voice,<br>For you are conscious of no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deed</a>,<br>And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, close by you, sees whate'er you do.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Again, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, in <em>Tim&aelig;us</em>,  says: <q>But if any one on consideration should actually institute  a rigid inquiry, he would be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the distinction between the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and the divine nature; because God mingles many  things up into one, [and again is able to dissolve one into many things,] seeing that He is endued with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and power; but no man either is, or ever shall be, able to perform any of these.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 5. The vain pretensions of false gods</h2>

<p>But concerning those who think that they shall share the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and perfect name, which some have received by a vain tradition as if they were gods, Menander in the <em>Auriga</em> says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>If there exists a god who walks out<br>With an old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, or who enters in<br>By stealth to houses through the folding-doors,<br>He ne'er can please me; nay, but only he<br>Who stays at home, a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and righteous <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,<br>To give <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to His worshippers.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>The same Menander, in the <em>Sacerdos</em>, says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>There is no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, that can save<br>One man by another; if indeed a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,<br>With sound of tinkling cymbals, charm a god<br>Where'er he lists, then assuredly<br>He who does so is much the greater god.<br>But these, O Rhode, are but the cunning schemes<br>Which daring men of intrigue, unabashed,<br>Invent to earn themselves a livelihood,<br>And yield a laughing-stock unto the age.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Again, the same Menander, stating his opinion about those who are received as gods, proving rather that they are not so, says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Yea, if I this beheld, I then should wish<br>That back to me again my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> returned.<br>For tell me where, O Getas, in the world<br>'Tis possible to find out righteous gods?</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And in the <em>Depositum</em>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>There's an unrighteous judgment, as it seems,<br>Even with the gods.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Euripides the tragedian, in <em>Orestes</em>, says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Apollo having caused by his command<br>The <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of the mother, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not<br>What honesty and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> signify.<br>We serve the gods, whoever they may be;<br>But from the central regions of the earth<br>You see Apollo plainly gives response<br>To mortals, and whate'er he says we do.<br>I him <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, when she that bore me fell<br>Slain by my hand: he is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man.<br>Then slay him, for 'twas he that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, not I.<br>What could I do? Think you not that the god<br>Should free me from the blame which I do bear?</q></p></blockquote>

<p>The same also in <em>Hippolytus</em>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But on these points the gods do not judge right.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And in <em>Ion</em>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But in the daughter of Erechtheus<br>What interest have I? For that pertains<br>Not unto such as me. But when I come<br>With golden vessels for libations, I<br>The dew shall sprinkle, and yet needs must warn<br>Apollo of his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; for when he weds<br>Maidens by force, the children secretly<br>Begotten he betrays, and then neglects<br>When dying. Thus not you; but while you may<br>Always pursue the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for the gods<br>Will surely punish men of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.<br>How is it right that you, who have prescribed<br>Laws for men's guidance, live unrighteously?<br>But you being absent, I shall freely speak,<br>And you to men shall satisfaction give<br>For marriage forced, you Neptune, Jupiter,<br>Who over heaven presides. The temples you<br>Have emptied, while <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> you repay.<br>And though you laud the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> to the skies,<br>Yet have you filled your hands with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.<br>No longer is it right to call men ill<br>If they do imitate the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>  of gods;  <br>Nay, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> let their teachers rather be.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And in <em>Archelaus</em>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Full oft, my son, do gods <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> perplex.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And in <em>Bellerophon</em>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>They are no gods, who do not what is right.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And again in the same:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Gods reign in heaven most certainly, says one;<br>But it is false,&mdash; and let not him<br>Who speaks thus, be so foolish as to use<br>Ancient tradition, or to pay regard<br>Unto my words: but with unclouded eye<br>Behold the matter in its clearest light.<br>Power absolute, I say, robs men of life<br>And property; transgresses plighted <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;<br>Nor spares even cities, but with cruel hand<br>Despoils and devastates them ruthlessly.<br>But they that do these things have more success<br>Than those who live a gentle <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> life;<br>And cities small, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, which reverence gods,<br>Submissive bend before the many spears<br>Of larger impious ones; yea, and methinks<br>If any man lounge idly, and abstain<br>From working with his hands for sustenance,<br>Yet <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the gods; he very soon will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a><br>If they from him misfortunes will avert.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And Menander in <em>Diphilus</em>: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Therefore ascribe we praise and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> great<br>To Him who Father is, and Lord of all;<br>Sole maker and preserver of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>,<br>And who with all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things our earth has stored.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>The same also in the <em>Piscatores</em>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For I deem that which nourishes my life<br>Is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but he whose custom 'tis to meet<br>The wants of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>&mdash;He needs not at our hands<br>Renewed supplies, Himself being all in all.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>The same in the <em>Fratres</em>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ever is intelligence to those<br>Who righteous are: so wisest men have thought.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And in the <em>Tibicin&aelig;</em>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Good reason finds a temple in all things<br>Wherein to worship; for what is the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,<br>But just the voice of God within us placed?</q></p></blockquote>

<p>  And the tragedian in <em>Phrixus</em>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But if the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and the impious<br>Share the same lot, how could we think it just,<br>If Jove, the best, judges not uprightly?</q></p></blockquote>

<p>In <em>Philoctetes</em>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>You see how <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> gain is deemed<br>Even to the gods; and how he is admired<br>Whose shrine is laden most with yellow gold.<br>What, then, does hinder you, since it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a><br>To be like gods, from thus accepting gain?</q></p></blockquote>

<p>In <em>Hecuba</em>:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>O Jupiter I whoever you may be,<br>Of whom except in word all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> fails;</q></p></blockquote>

<p>and&mdash;</p> <blockquote><p><q>Jupiter, whether you are indeed<br>A great necessity, or the mind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,<br>I worship you!</q></p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 6. We should acknowledge one only God</h2>

<p>Here, then, is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and of a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> loving <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, to recur to the communion of the unity,  and to attach one's self to <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and make choice of the better things according to the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> placed in man; and not to think that those who are possessed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are lords of all, when they shall not appear to have even equal power with men. For in Homer,  Demodocus says he is self-taught &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> inspired me with strains</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>though he is a mortal. &AElig;sculapius and Apollo are taught to heal by Chiron the Centaur,&mdash; a very novel thing indeed, for gods to be taught by a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. What need I speak of Bacchus, who the poet says is mad? Or of Hercules, who he says is unhappy? What need to speak of Mars and Venus, the leaders of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; and by means of all these to establish the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> which has been undertaken? For if some one, in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, should imitate the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which are said to be divine, he would be reckoned among impure men, and a stranger to life and humanity; and if any one does so knowingly, he will have a plausible excuse for escaping vengeance, by showing that imitation of godlike <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of audacity is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But if any one should blame these <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, he will take away their well-known names, and not cover them up with specious and plausible words. It is necessary, then, to accept the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and invariable Name, not proclaimed by my words only, but by the words of those who have introduced us to the elements of learning, in order that we may not, by living idly in this present state of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, not only as those who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but also as having <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> ourselves ungrateful, render our account to the Judge. </p>
