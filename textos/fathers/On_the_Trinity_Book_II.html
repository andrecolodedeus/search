<h1>On the Trinity (Book II)</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">Augustine pursues his defense of the equality of the Trinity; and in treating of the sending of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and of the various appearances of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, demonstrates that He who is sent is not therefore less than He who sends, because the one has sent, the other has been sent; but that the Trinity, being in all things equal, and alike in its own nature unchangeable and invisible and omnipresent, works indivisibly in each sending or appearance.</span> </p>

<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>When men seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and bend their minds according to the capacity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness to the understanding of the Trinity; learning, as they must, by experience, the wearisome difficulties of the task, whether from the sight itself of the mind striving to gaze upon light unapproachable, or, indeed, from the manifold and various modes of speech employed in the sacred writings (wherein, as it seems to me, the mind is nothing else but roughly exercised, in order that it may find sweetness when <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ);&mdash; such men, I say, when they have dispelled every ambiguity, and arrived at something certain, ought of all others most easily to make allowance for those who <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in the investigation of so deep a secret. But there are two things most hard to bear with, in the case of those who are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>: hasty assumption before the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is made plain; and, when it has been made plain, defence of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> thus hastily assumed. From which two faults, inimical as they are to the finding out of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and to the handling of the divine and sacred books, should <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and hope, defend and protect me with the shield of His good will,  and with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of His mercy, I will not be slow to search out the substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whether through His Scripture or through the creature. For both of these are set forth for our <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> to this end, that He may Himself be sought, and Himself be loved, who inspired the one, and created the other. Nor shall I be afraid of giving my opinion, in which I shall more desire to be examined by the upright, than <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to be carped at by the perverse. For charity, most excellent and unassuming, gratefully accepts the dovelike eye; but for the dog's tooth nothing remains, save either to shun it by the most cautious humility, or to blunt it by the most solid <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and far rather would I be censured by any one whatsoever, than be praised by either the erring or the flatterer. For the lover of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> need <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> no one's censure. For he that censures, must needs be either enemy or friend. And if an enemy reviles, he must be borne with: but a friend, if he <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a>, must be taught; if he teaches, listened to. But if one who <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> praises you, he confirms your <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; if one who flatters, he seduces you into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. <q>Let the righteous,</q> therefore, <q>smite me, it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove me; but the oil of the sinner shall not anoint my head.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; There is a Double Rule for Understanding the Scriptural Modes of Speech Concerning the Son of God. These Modes of Speech are of a Threefold Kind.</h2>

<p>2. Wherefore, although we hold most firmly, concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, what may be called the canonical rule, as it is both disseminated through the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and has been demonstrated by learned and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> handlers of the same Scriptures, namely, that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is both understood  to be equal to the Father according to the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in which He is, and less than the Father according to the form of a servant which He took;  in which form He was found to be not only less than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but also less than the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and not only so, but less even than Himself&mdash;not than Himself who was, but than Himself who is; because, by taking the form of a servant, He did not lose the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the testimonies of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> taught us, to which we have referred in the former book: yet there are some things in the sacred text so put as to leave it ambiguous to which rule they are rather to be referred; whether to that by which we understand the Son as less, in that He has taken upon Him the creature, or to that by which we understand that the Son is not indeed less than, but equal to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but yet that He is from Him, God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Light of light. For we call the Son God <em>of</em> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, God only; not <em>of</em> God. Whence it is plain that the Son has another <em>of</em> whom He is, and to whom He is Son; but that the Father has not a Son <em>of</em> whom He is, but only to whom He is father. For every son is what he is, <em> of</em> his father, and is son to his father; but no father is what he is, <em>of</em> his son, but is father to his son. </p>

<p>3. Some things, then, are so put in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> concerning the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as to intimate the unity and equality of their substance; as, for instance, <q>I and the Father are one;</q>  and, <q>Who, being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q>  and whatever other texts there are of the kind. And some, again, are so put that they show the Son as less on account of the form of a servant, that is, of His having taken upon Him the creature of a changeable and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> substance; as, for instance, that which says, <q>For my Father is greater than I;</q>  and, <q>The Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment unto the Son.</q> For a little after he goes on to say, <q>And has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>.</q> And further, some are so put, as to show Him at that time neither as less nor as equal, but only to intimate that He is of the Father; as, for instance, that which says, <q>For as the Father has life in Himself, so has He given to the Son to have life in Himself;</q> and that other: <q>The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do.</q>  For if we shall take this to be therefore so said, because the Son is less in the form taken from the creature, it will follow that the Father must have walked on the water, or opened the eyes with clay and spittle of some other one born blind, and have done the other things which the Son appearing in the flesh did among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, before the Son did them;  in order that He might be able to do those things, who said that the Son was not able to do anything of Himself, except what He has seen the Father do. Yet who, even though he were mad, would think this? It remains, therefore, that these texts are so expressed, because the life of the Son is unchangeable as that of the Father is, and yet He is of the Father; and the working of the Father and of the Son is indivisible, and yet so to work is given to the Son from Him of whom He Himself is, that is, from the Father; and the Son so sees the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as that He is the Son in the very seeing Him. For to be of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that is, to be born of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is to Him nothing else than to see the Father; and to see Him working, is nothing else than to work with Him: but therefore not from Himself, because He is not from Himself. And, therefore, those things which <q>He sees the Father do, these also does the Son likewise,</q> because He is of the Father. For He neither does other things in like manner, as a painter paints other pictures, in the same way as he sees others to have been painted by another man; nor the same things in a different manner, as the body expresses the same letters, which the mind has thought; but <q>whatsoever things,</q> says He, <q>the Father does, these same things also does the Son likewise.</q>  He has said both <q>these same things,</q> and <q>likewise;</q> and hence the working of both the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is indivisible and equal, but it is from the Father to the Son. Therefore the Son cannot do anything of Himself, except what He sees the Father do. From this rule, then, whereby the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> so speak as to mean, not to set forth one as less than another, but only to show which is of which, some have drawn this meaning, as if the Son were said to be less. And some among ourselves who are more unlearned and least instructed in these things, endeavoring to take these texts according to the form of a servant, and so misinterpreting them, are troubled. And to prevent this, the rule in question is to be observed whereby the Son is not less, but it is simply intimated that He is of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in which words not His inequality but His birth is declared.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; That Some Ways of Speaking Concerning the Son are to Be Understood According to Either Rule.</h2>

<p>4. There are, then, some things in the sacred books, as I began by saying, so put, that it is doubtful to which they are to be referred: whether to that rule whereby the Son is less on account of His having taken the creature; or whether to that whereby it is intimated that although equal, yet He is of the Father. And in my opinion, if this is in such way doubtful, that which it really is can neither be explained nor discerned, then such passages may without danger be understood according to either rule, as that, for instance, <q>My doctrine is not mine, but His that sent me.</q>  For this may both be taken according to the form of a servant, as we have already treated it in the former book;  or according to the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in which He is in such way equal to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that He is yet of the Father. For according to the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the Son is not one and His life another, but the life itself is the Son; so the Son is not one and His doctrine another, but the doctrine itself is the Son. And hence, as the text, <q>He has given life to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,</q> is no otherwise to be understood than, He has begotten the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who is life; so also when it is said, He has given doctrine to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, it may be rightly understood to mean, He has begotten the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who is doctrine so that, when it is said, <q>My doctrine is not mine, but His who sent me,</q> it is so to be understood as if it were, I am not from myself, but from Him who sent me.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; Some Things Concerning the Holy Spirit are to Be Understood According to the One Rule Only.</h2>

<p>5. For even of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, of whom it is not said, <q>He emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant;</q> yet the Lord Himself says, <q>Howbeit, when He the Spirit of Truth has come, He will guide you into all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For He shall not speak of Himself, but whatsoever He shall hear that shall He speak; and He will show you things to come. He shall glorify me; for He shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you.</q> And except He had immediately gone on to say after this, <q>All things that the Father has are mine; therefore said I, that He shall take of mine, and shall show it unto you;</q>  it might, perhaps, have been <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was so born of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as Christ is of the Father. Since He had said of Himself, <q>My doctrine is not mine, but His that sent me;</q> but of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, <q>For He shall not speak of Himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall He speak;</q> and, <q>For He shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you.</q> But because He has rendered the reason why He said, <q>He shall receive of mine</q> (for He says, <q>All things that the Father has are mine; therefore said I, that He shall take of mine</q>); it remains that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> be understood to have of that which is the Father's, as the Son also has. And how can this be, unless according to that which we have said above, <q>But when the Comforter has come, whom I will send unto you from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, even the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He shall testify of me</q>?  He is said, therefore, not to speak of Himself, in that He proceeds from the Father; and as it does not follow that the Son is less because He said, <q>The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do</q> (for He has not said this according to the form of a servant, but according to the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as we have already shown, and these words do not set Him forth as less than, but as of the Father), so it is not brought to pass that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is less, because it is said of Him, <q>For He shall not speak of Himself, but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak;</q> for the words belong to Him as <em>proceeding</em> from the Father. But whereas both the Son is of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, why both are not called sons, and both not said to be begotten, but the former is called the one only-begotten Son, and the latter, <em>viz.</em> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, neither son nor begotten, because if begotten, then certainly a son, we will discuss in another place, if God shall grant, and so far as He shall grant. </p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; The Glorification of the Son by the Father Does Not Prove Inequality.</h2>

<p>6. But here also let them wake up if they can, who have thought this, too, to be a testimony on their side, to show that the Father is greater than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because the Son has said, <q>Father, glorify me.</q> Why, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also glorifies Him. Pray, is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, too, greater than He? Moreover, if on that account the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> glorifies the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because He shall receive of that which is the Son's, and shall therefore receive of that which is the Son's because all things that the Father has are the Son's also; it is evident that when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> glorifies the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the Father glorifies the Son. Whence it may be perceived that all things that the Father has are not only of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but also of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is able to glorify the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, whom the Father glorifies. But if he who glorifies is greater than he whom he glorifies, let them allow that those are equal who mutually glorify each other. But it is written, also, that the Son glorifies the Father; for He says, <q>I have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> You on the earth.</q>  Truly let them beware lest the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> be thought greater than both, because He glorifies the Son whom the Father glorifies, while it is not written that He Himself is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> either by the Father or by the Son.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; The Son and Holy Spirit are Not Therefore Less Because Sent. The Son is Sent Also by Himself. Of the Sending of the Holy Spirit.</h2>

<p>7. But being <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> wrong so far, men betake themselves to saying, that he who sends is greater than he who is sent: therefore the Father is greater than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because the Son continually speaks of Himself as being sent by the Father; and the Father is also greater than the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, because Jesus has said of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, <q>Whom the Father will send in my name;</q>  and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is less than both, because both the Father sends Him, as we have said, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, when He says, <q>But if I depart, I will send Him unto you.</q> I first ask, then, in this inquiry, whence and whither the Son was sent. <q>I,</q> He says, <q>came forth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and have come into the world.</q>  Therefore, to be sent, is to come forth forth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and to come into the world. What, then, is that which the same <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says concerning Him, <q>He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not;</q> and then he adds, <q>He came unto His own?</q>  Certainly He was sent there, whither He came; but if He was sent into the world, because He came forth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, then He both came into the world and was in the world. He was sent therefore there, where He already was. For consider that, too, which is written in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, that God said, <q>Do not I fill heaven and earth?</q>  If this is said of the Son (for some will have it understood that the Son Himself spoke either by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> or in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>), whither was He sent except to the place where He already was? For He who says, <q>I fill heaven and earth,</q> was everywhere. But if it is said of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, where could He be without His own word and without His own wisdom, which <q>reaches from one end to another mightily, and sweetly orders all things?</q>  But He cannot be anywhere without His own Spirit. Therefore, if God is everywhere, His Spirit also is everywhere. Therefore, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, too, was sent there, where He already was. For he, too, who finds no place to which he might go from the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who says, <q>If I ascend up into heaven, You are there; if I shall go down into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, behold, You are there;</q> wishing it to be understood that God is present everywhere, named in the previous verse His Spirit; for He says, Whither shall I go from Your Spirit? Or whither shall I flee from Your presence? </p>

<p>8. For this reason, then, if both the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are sent there where they were, we must inquire, how that sending, whether of the Son or of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, is to be understood; for of the Father alone, we nowhere read that He is sent. Now, of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the apostle writes thus: <q>But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law.</q>  <q>He sent,</q> he says, <q>His Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q> And by this term, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,  what <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he did not wish to signify the privation of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>; but, according to a Hebraism, the difference of sex? When, therefore, he says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q> he sufficiently shows that the Son was <q>sent</q> in this very way, in that He was <q>made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q> Therefore, in that He was born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He was in the world; but in that He was born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, He was sent and came into the world. Moreover, He could not be sent by the Father without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, not only because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when He sent Him, that is, when He made Him of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, is certainly understood not to have so made Him without His own Spirit; but also because it is most plainly and expressly said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in answer to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, when she asked of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, <q>How shall this be?</q> <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you.</q>  And Matthew says, <q>She was found with child of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q>  Although, too, in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah, Christ Himself is understood to say of His own future advent, <q>And now the Lord God and His Spirit has sent me.</q> </p>

<p>9. Perhaps some one may wish to drive us to say, that the Son is sent also by Himself, because the conception and childbirth of Mary is the working of the Trinity, by whose act of creating all things are created. And how, he will go on to say, has the Father sent Him, if He sent Himself? To whom I answer first, by asking him to tell me, if he can, in what manner the Father has sanctified Him, if He has sanctified Himself? For the same Lord says both; <q>Say of Him,</q> He says, <q>whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, You <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>, because I said, I am the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;</q>  while in another place He says, <q>And for their sake I sanctify myself.</q>  I ask, also, in what manner the Father delivered Him, if He delivered Himself? For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says both: <q>Who,</q> he says, <q>spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all;</q>  while elsewhere he says of the Saviour Himself, <q>Who loved me, and delivered Himself for me.</q>  He will reply, I suppose, if he has a right sense in these things, Because the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is one, and their working indivisible. In like manner, then, let him understand the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> and nativity of the Virgin, wherein the Son is understood as sent, to have been wrought by one and the same operation of the Father and of the Son indivisibly; the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> certainly not being thence excluded, of whom it is expressly said, <q>She was found with child by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> For perhaps our meaning will be more plainly unfolded, if we ask in what manner God sent His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. He commanded that He should come, and He, complying with the commandment, came. Did He then request, or did He only suggest? But whichever of these it was, certainly it was done by a word, and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Himself. Wherefore, since the Father sent Him by a word, His being sent was the work of both the Father and His Word; therefore the same Son was sent by the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because the Son Himself is the Word of the Father. For who would embrace so impious an opinion as to think the Father to have uttered a word in time, in order that the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Son might thereby be sent and might appear in the flesh in the fullness of time? But assuredly it was in that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> itself which was in the beginning with God and was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely, in the wisdom itself of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, apart from time, at what time that wisdom must needs appear in the flesh. Therefore, since without any commencement of time, the Word was in the beginning, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it was in the Word itself without any time, at what time the Word was to be made flesh and dwell among us.  And when this fullness of time had come, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q>  that is, made in time, that the Incarnate Word might appear to men; while it was in that Word Himself, apart from time, at what time this was to be done; for the order of times is in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> wisdom of God without time. Since, then, that the Son should appear in the flesh was wrought by both the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, it is fitly said that He who appeared in that flesh was sent, and that He who did not appear in it, sent Him; because those things which are transacted outwardly before the bodily eyes have their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from the inward structure (<em>apparatu</em>) of the spiritual nature, and on that account are fitly said to be sent. Further, that form of man which He took is the person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, not also of the Father; on which account the invisible Father, together with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who with the Father is invisible, is said to have sent the same Son by making Him visible. But if He became visible in such way as to cease to be invisible with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that is, if the substance of the invisible Word were turned by a change and transition into a visible creature, then the Son would be so understood to be sent by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that He would be found to be only sent; not also, with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, sending. But since He so took the form of a servant, as that the unchangeable form of God remained, it is clear that that which became apparent in the Son was done by the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> not being apparent; that is, that by the invisible Father, with the invisible Son, the same Son Himself was sent so as to be visible. Why, therefore, does He say, <q>Neither came I of myself?</q> This, we may now say, is said according to the form of a servant, in the same way as it is said, <q>I judge no man.</q> </p>

<p>10. If, therefore, He is said to be sent, in so far as He appeared outwardly in the bodily creature, who inwardly in His spiritual nature is always hidden from the eyes of mortals, it is now easy to understand also of the Holy Spirit why He too is said to be sent. For in due time a certain outward appearance of the creature was wrought, wherein the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> might be visibly shown; whether when He descended upon the Lord Himself in a bodily shape as a dove,  or when, ten days having past since His ascension, on the day of Pentecost a sound came suddenly from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and cloven tongues like as of fire were seen upon them, and it sat upon each of them.  This operation, visibly exhibited, and presented to mortal eyes, is called the sending of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; not that His very substance appeared, in which He himself also is invisible and unchangeable, like the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but that the hearts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, touched by things seen outwardly, might be turned from the manifestation in time of Him as coming to His hidden <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> as ever present.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; The Creature is Not So Taken by the Holy Spirit as Flesh is by the Word.</h2>

<p>11. It is, then, for this reason nowhere written, that the Father is greater than the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, or that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is less than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because the creature in which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was to appear was not taken in the same way as the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> was taken, as the form in which the person of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> Himself should be set forth not that He might possess the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and wise men have possessed it, but <q>above His fellows;</q>  not certainly that He possessed the word more than they, so as to be of more surpassing wisdom than the rest were, but that He was the very Word Himself. For the word in the flesh is one thing, and the Word made flesh is another; <em> i.e.</em> the word in man is one thing, the Word that is man is another. For flesh is put for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, where it is said, <q>The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>;</q>  and again, <q>And all flesh shall see the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  For it does not mean flesh without <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and without mind; but <q>all flesh,</q> is the same as if it were said, every man. The creature, then, in which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> should appear, was not so taken, as that flesh and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form were taken, of the Virgin Mary. For the Spirit did not beatify the dove, or the wind, or the fire, and join them for ever to Himself and to His person in unity and <q>fashion.</q>  Nor, again, is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> mutable and changeable; so that these things were not made of the creature, but He himself was turned and changed first into one and then into another, as water is changed into ice. But these things appeared at the seasons at which they ought to have appeared, the creature serving the Creator, and being changed and converted at the command of Him who remains immutably in Himself, in order to signify and manifest Him in such way as it was fit He should be signified and manifested to mortal men. Accordingly, although that dove is called the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>;  and in speaking of that fire, <q>There appeared unto them,</q> he says, cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them; and they began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance;  in order to show that the Spirit was manifested by that fire, as by the dove; yet we cannot call the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> both God and a dove, or both God and fire, in the same way as we call the Son both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; nor as we call the Son the Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which not only John the Baptist says, <q>Behold the Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  but also John the Evangelist sees the Lamb slain in the Apocalypse.  For that prophetic vision was not shown to bodily eyes through bodily forms, but in the spirit through spiritual images of bodily things. But whosoever saw that dove and that fire, saw them with their eyes. Although it may perhaps be disputed concerning the fire, whether it was seen by the eyes or in the spirit, on account of the form of the sentence. For the text does not say, They saw cloven tongues like fire, but, <q>There appeared to them.</q> But we are not wont to say with the same meaning, It appeared to me; as we say, I saw. And in those spiritual visions of corporeal images the usual expressions are, both, It appeared to me; and, I saw: but in those things which are shown to the eyes through express corporeal forms, the common expression is not, It appeared to me; but, I saw. There may, therefore, be a question raised respecting that fire, how it was seen; whether within in the spirit as it were outwardly, or really outwardly before the eyes of the flesh. But of that dove, which is said to have descended in a bodily form, no one ever <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that it was seen by the eyes. Nor, again, as we call the Son a Rock (for it is written, <q>And that Rock was Christ</q> ), can we so call the Spirit a dove or fire. For that rock was a thing already created, and after the mode of its action was called by the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whom it signified; like the stone placed under Jacob's head, and also anointed, which he took in order to signify the Lord;  or as Isaac was Christ, when he carried the wood for the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of himself.  A particular significative action was added to those already existing things; they did not, as that dove and fire, suddenly come into being in order simply so to signify. The dove and the fire, indeed, seem to me more like that flame which appeared to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the bush,  or that pillar which the people followed in the wilderness,  or the thunders and lightnings which came when the Law was given in the mount.  For the corporeal form of these things came into being for the very purpose, that it might signify something, and then pass away. </p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; A Doubt Raised About Divine Appearances.</h2>

<p>12. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, then, is also said to be sent, on account of these corporeal forms which came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in time, in order to signify and manifest Him, as He must needs be manifested, to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> senses; yet He is not said to be less than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because He was in the form of a servant, is said to be; because that form of a servant inhered in the unity of the person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but those corporeal forms appeared for a time, in order to show what was necessary to be shown, and then ceased to be. Why, then, is not the Father also said to be sent, through those corporeal forms, the fire of the bush, and the pillar of cloud or of fire, and the lightnings in the mount, and whatever other things of the kind appeared at that time, when (as we have learned from Scripture testimony) He spoke face to face with the fathers, if He Himself was manifested by those modes and forms of the creature, as exhibited and presented corporeally to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sight? But if the Son was manifested by them, why is He said to be sent so long after, when He was made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, as the apostle says, <q>But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q>  seeing that He was sent also before, when He appeared to the fathers by those changeable forms of the creature? Or if He cannot rightly be said to be sent, unless when the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, why is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> said to be sent, of whom no such <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> was ever wrought? But if by those visible things, which are put before us in the Law and in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, neither the Father nor the Son but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was manifested, why also is He said to be sent now, when He was sent also before after these modes?</p>

<p>13. In the perplexity of this inquiry, the Lord helping us, we must ask, first, whether the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; or whether, sometimes the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, sometimes the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, sometimes the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; or whether it was without any distinction of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, in such way as the one and only God is spoken of, that is, that the Trinity itself appeared to the Fathers by those forms of the creature. Next, whichever of these alternatives shall have been found or thought <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whether for this purpose only the creature was fashioned, wherein <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as He judged it suitable at that time, should be shown to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sight; or whether <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, were so sent, as to speak in the person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, taking a corporeal form from the corporeal creature, for the purpose of their ministry, as each had need; or else, according to the power the Creator has given them, changing and converting their own body itself, to which they are not subject, but govern it as subject to themselves, into whatever appearances they would that were suited and apt to their several actions. Lastly, we shall discern that which it was our purpose to ask, <em>viz</em>. whether the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> were also sent before; and, if they were so sent, what difference there is between that sending, and the one which we read of in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; or whether in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> neither of them were sent, except when either the Son was made of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> appeared in a visible form, whether in the dove or in tongues of fire.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; The Entire Trinity Invisible.</h2>

<p>14. Let us therefore say nothing of those who, with an over carnal <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, have thought the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and the Wisdom, which, <q>remaining in herself, makes all things new,</q>  whom we call the only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, not only to be changeable, but also to be visible. For these, with more audacity than religion, bring a very dull heart to the inquiry into divine things. For whereas the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a spiritual substance, and whereas itself also was made, yet could not be made by any other than by Him by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing is made,  it, although changeable, is yet not visible; and this they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be the case with the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> Himself and with the Wisdom of God itself, by which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was made; whereas this Wisdom is not only invisible, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also is, but likewise unchangeable, which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not. It is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the same unchangeableness in it, which is referred to when it was said, <q>Remaining in herself she makes all things new.</q> Yet these people, endeavoring, as it were, to prop up their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in its fall by testimonies of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, adduce the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>; and take that, which is said of the one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whom the Trinity itself is understood, to be said only of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and neither of the Son nor of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>: <q>Now unto the King <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, invisible, the only wise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever;</q>  and that other passage, <q>The blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man has seen, nor can see.</q>  How these passages are to be understood, I think we have already discoursed sufficiently. </p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; Against Those Who Believed the Father Only to Be Immortal and Invisible. The Truth to Be Sought by Peaceful Study.</h2>

<p>15. But they who will have these texts understood only of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and not of the Son or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, declare the Son to be visible, not by having taken flesh of the Virgin, but aforetime also in Himself. For He Himself, they say, appeared to the eyes of the Fathers. And if you say to them, In whatever manner, then, the Son is visible in Himself, in that manner also He is mortal in Himself; so that it plainly follows that you would have this saying also understood only of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <em>viz</em>., <q>Who only has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>;</q> for if the Son is mortal from having taken upon Him our flesh, then allow that it is on account of this flesh that He is also visible: they reply, that it is not on account of this flesh that they say that the Son is mortal; but that, just as He was also before visible, so He was also before mortal. For if they say the Son is mortal from having taken our flesh, then it is not the Father alone without the Son who has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; because His Word also has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, by which all things were made. For He did not therefore lose His <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, because He took mortal flesh; seeing that it could not happen even to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that it should die with the body, when the Lord Himself says, <q>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q>  Or, forsooth, also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> took flesh: concerning whom certainly they will, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, be troubled to say&mdash; if the Son is mortal on account of taking our flesh&mdash; in what manner they understand that the Father only has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> without the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, since, indeed, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> did not take our flesh; and if He has not <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, then the Son is not mortal on account of taking our flesh; but if the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, then it is not said only of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>Who only has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</q> And therefore they think they are able to prove that the Son in Himself was mortal also before the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, because changeableness itself is not unfitly called mortality, according to which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also is said to die; not because it is changed and turned into body, or into some substance other than itself, but because, whatever in its own selfsame substance is now after another mode than it once was, is discovered to be mortal, in so far as it has ceased to be what it was. Because then, say they, before the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was born of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, He Himself appeared to our fathers, not in one and the same form only, but in many forms; first in one form, then in another; He is both visible in Himself, because His substance was visible to mortal eyes, when He had not yet taken our flesh, and mortal, inasmuch as He is changeable. And so also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who appeared at one time as a dove, and another time as fire. Whence, they say, the following texts do not belong to the Trinity, but singularly and properly to the Father only: <q>Now unto the King <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and invisible, the only wise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and, <q>Who only has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man has seen, nor can see.</q></p>

<p>16. Passing by, then, these reasoners, who are unable to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the substance even of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is invisible, and therefore are very far indeed from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the substance of the one and only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, remains ever not only invisible, but also unchangeable, and that hence it possesses <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and real <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; let us, who deny that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whether the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the Holy Spirit, ever appeared to bodily eyes, unless through the corporeal creature made subject to His own power; let us, I say&mdash; ready to be corrected, if we are reproved in a fraternal and upright spirit, ready to be so, even if carped at by an enemy, so that he speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash; in catholic peace and with peaceful study inquire, whether God indiscriminately appeared to our fathers before Christ came in the flesh, or whether it was any one person of the Trinity, or whether severally, as it were by turns.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10&mdash; Whether God the Trinity Indiscriminately Appeared to the Fathers, or Any One Person of the Trinity. The Appearing of God to Adam. Of the Same Appearance. The Vision to Abraham.</h2>

<p>17. And first, in that which is written in Genesis, <em>viz</em>., that God spoke with man whom He had formed out of the dust; if we set apart the figurative meaning, and treat it so as to place <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the narrative even in the letter, it should appear that God then spoke with man in the appearance of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. This is not indeed expressly laid down in the book, but the general tenor of its reading sounds in this sense, especially in that which is written, that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> heard the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, walking in the garden in the cool of the evening, and hid himself among the trees of the garden; and when God said, <q>Adam, where are you?</q>  replied, <q>I heard Your voice, and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself from Your face.</q> For I do not see how such a walking and conversation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be understood literally, except He appeared as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For it can neither be said that a voice only of God was framed, when God is said to have walked, or that He who was walking in a place was not visible; while Adam, too, says that he hid himself from the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Who then was He? Whether the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? Whether altogether indiscriminately did God the Trinity Himself speak to man in the form of man? The context, indeed, itself of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> nowhere, it should seem, indicates a change from person to person; but He seems still to speak to the first man, who said, <q>Let there be light,</q> and, <q>Let there be a firmament,</q> and so on through each of those days; whom we usually take to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, making by a word whatever He willed to make. For He made all things by His word, which Word we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, by the right rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to be His only Son. If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father spoke to the first man, and Himself was walking in the garden in the cool of the evening, and if it was from His face that the sinner hid himself among the trees of the garden, why are we not to go on to understand that it was He also who appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and to whom He would, and how He would, through the changeable and visible creature, subjected to Himself, while He Himself remains in Himself and in His own substance, in which He is unchangeable and invisible? But, possibly, it might be that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> passed over in a hidden way from person to person, and while it had related that the Father said <q>Let there be light,</q> and the rest which it mentioned Him to have done by the Word, went on to indicate the Son as speaking to the first man; not unfolding this openly, but intimating it to be understood by those who could understand it.</p>

<p>18. Let him, then, who has the strength whereby he can penetrate this secret with his mind's eye, so that to him it appears clearly, either that the Father also is able, or that only the Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are able, to appear to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> eyes through a visible creature; let him, I say, proceed to examine these things if he can, or even to express and handle them in words; but the thing itself, so far as concerns this testimony of Scripture, where God spoke with man, is, in my judgment, not discoverable, because it does not evidently appear even whether <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> usually saw God with the eyes of his body; especially as it is a great question what manner of eyes it was that were opened when they tasted the forbidden fruit;  for before they had tasted, these eyes were closed. Yet I would not rashly assert, even if that scripture implies Paradise to have been a material place, that God could not have walked there in any way except in some bodily form. For it might be said, that only words were framed for the man to hear, without seeing any form. Neither, because it is written, <q>Adam hid himself from the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> does it follow immediately that he usually saw His face. For what if he himself indeed could not see, but feared to be himself seen by Him whose voice he had heard, and had felt His presence as he walked? For Cain, too, said to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>From Your face I will hide myself;</q>  yet we are not therefore compelled to admit that he was wont to behold the face of God with his bodily eyes in any visible form, although he had heard the voice of God questioning and speaking with him of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But what manner of speech it was that God then uttered to the outward ears of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, especially in speaking to the first man, it is both difficult to discover, and we have not undertaken to say in this discourse. But if words alone and sounds were wrought, by which to bring about some sensible presence of God to those first men, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> why I should not there understand the person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, seeing that His person is manifested also in that voice, when Jesus appeared in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on the mount before the three <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>;  and in that when the dove descended upon Him at His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>;  and in that where He cried to the Father concerning His own glorification and it was answered Him, <q>I have both <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, and will glorify again.</q>  Not that the voice could be wrought without the work of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> (since the Trinity works indivisibly), but that such a voice was wrought as to manifest the person of the Father only; just as the Trinity wrought that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form from the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, yet it is the person of the Son alone; for the invisible Trinity wrought the visible person of the Son alone. Neither does anything forbid us, not only to understand those words spoken to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> as spoken by the Trinity, but also to take them as manifesting the person of that Trinity. For we are compelled to understand of the Father only, that which is said, <q>This is my beloved Son.</q>  For Jesus can neither be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> nor understood to be the Son of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, or even His own Son. And where the voice uttered, <q>I have both <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, and will glorify again,</q> we confess it was only the person of the Father; since it is the answer to that word of the Lord, in which He had said, <q>Father, glorify your Son,</q> which He could not say except to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father only, and not also to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, whose Son He was not. But here, where it is written, <q>And the Lord God said to Adam,</q> no reason can be given why the Trinity itself should not be understood.</p>

<p>19. Likewise, also, in that which is written, <q>Now the Lord had said unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and your father's house,</q> it is not clear whether a voice alone came to the ears of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, or whether anything also appeared to his eyes. But a little while after, it is somewhat more clearly said, <q>And the Lord appeared unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and said, Unto your seed will I give this land.</q>  But neither there is it expressly said in what form God appeared to him, or whether the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> appeared to him. Unless, perhaps, they think that it was the Son who appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, because it is not written, God appeared to him, but <q>the Lord appeared to him.</q> For the Son seems to be called the Lord as though the name was appropriated to Him; as <em>e.g.</em> the apostle says, <q>For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many and lords many,) but to us there is but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom are all things, and we by Him.</q>  But since it is found that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father also is called Lord in many places&mdash;for instance, <q>The Lord has said unto me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten You;</q>  and again, <q>The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at my right hand;</q>  since also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is found to be called Lord, as where the apostle says, <q>Now the Lord is that Spirit;</q> and then, lest any one should think the Son to be signified, and to be called the Spirit on account of His incorporeal substance, has gone on to say, <q>And where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is, there is liberty;</q>  and no one ever <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>: therefore, neither here does it appear plainly whether it was any person of the Trinity that appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, or God Himself the Trinity, of which one God it is said, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him only shall you serve.</q>  But under the oak at Mamre he saw three men, whom he invited, and hospitably received, and ministered to them as they feasted. Yet Scripture at the beginning of that narrative does not say, three men appeared to him, but, <q>The Lord appeared to him.</q> And then, setting forth in due order after what manner the Lord appeared to him, it has added the account of the three men, whom <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> invites to his hospitality in the plural number, and afterwards speaks to them in the singular number as one; and as one He promises him a son by Sara, <em>viz</em>. the one whom the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> calls Lord, as in the beginning of the same narrative, <q>The Lord,</q> it says, <q>appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> He invites them then, and washes their feet, and leads them forth at their departure, as though they were men; but he speaks as with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, whether when a son is promised to him, or when the destruction is shown to him that was impending over <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; Of the Same Appearance.</h2>

<p>20. That place of Scripture demands neither a slight nor a passing consideration. For if one man had appeared, what else would those at once cry out, who say that the Son was visible also in His own substance before He was born of the Virgin, but that it was Himself? Since it is said, they say, of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>To the only invisible God.</q>  And yet, I could still go on to demand, in what manner <q>He was found in fashion as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</q> before He had taken our flesh, seeing that his feet were washed, and that He fed upon earthly food? How could that be, when He was still <q>in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with God?</q>  For, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, had He already <q>emptied Himself, taking upon Him the form of a servant, and made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and found in fashion as a man?</q> when we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> when it was that He did this through His birth of the Virgin. How, then, before He had done this, did He appear as one man to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>? Or, was not that form a reality? I could put these questions, if it had been one man that appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and if that one were <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But since three men appeared, and no one of them is said to be greater than the rest either in form, or age, or power, why should we not here understand, as visibly intimated by the visible creature, the equality of the Trinity, and one and the same substance in three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>? </p>

<p>21. For, lest any one should think that one among the three is in this way intimated to have been the greater, and that this one is to be understood to have been the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, while the other two were His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; because, whereas three appeared, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> there speaks to one as the Lord: <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> has not forgotten to anticipate, by a contradiction, such future cogitations and opinions, when a little while after it says that two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> came to <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, among whom that just man also, who deserved to be freed from the burning of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, speaks to one as to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. For so Scripture goes on to say, <q>And the Lord went His way, as soon as He left communing with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> returned to his place.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; The Appearance to Lot is Examined.</h2>

<p><q>But there came two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> at even.</q> Here, what I have begun to set forth must be considered more attentively. Certainly <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was speaking with three, and called that one, in the singular number, the Lord. Perhaps, some one may say, he recognized one of the three to be the Lord, but the other two His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. What, then, does that mean which Scripture goes on to say, <q>And the Lord went His way, as soon as He had left communing with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> returned to his place: and there came two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> at even?</q> Are we to suppose that the one who, among the three, was recognized as the Lord, had departed, and had sent the two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that were with Him to destroy <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>? Let us see, then, what follows. <q>There came,</q> it is said, <q>two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> at even; and <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> sat in the gate of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>: and <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> seeing them, rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, into your servant's house.</q> Here it is clear, both that there were two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and that in the plural number they were invited to partake of hospitality, and that they were honorably designated lords, when they perchance were thought to be men.</p>

<p>22. Yet, again, it is objected that except they were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> would not have bowed himself with his face to the ground. Why, then, is both hospitality and food offered to them, as though they wanted such <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> succor? But whatever may here lie hidden, let us now pursue that which we have undertaken. Two appear; both are called <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; they are invited plurally; he speaks as with two plurally, until the departure from <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>. And then Scripture goes on to say, <q>And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that they said, Escape for your life; look not behind you, neither stay in all the plain; escape to the mountain, and there you shall be saved,  lest you be consumed. And <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> said unto them, Oh! not so, my lord: behold now, your servant has found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in your sight,</q>  etc. What is meant by his saying to them, <q>Oh! not so, my lord,</q> if He who was the Lord had already departed, and had sent the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>? Why is it said, <q>Oh! not so, my lord,</q> and not, <q>Oh! not so, my lords?</q> Or if he wished to speak to one of them, why does Scripture say, <q>But <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> said to them, Oh! not so, my lord: behold now, your servant has found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in your sight,</q> etc.? Are we here, too, to understand two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the plural number, but when the two are addressed as one, then the one Lord God of one substance? But which two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> do we here understand?&mdash; of the Father and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or of the Father and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, or of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? The last, perhaps, is the more suitable; for they said of themselves that they were sent, which is that which we say of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For we find nowhere in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> that the Father was sent. </p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; The Appearance in the Bush.</h2>

<p>23. But when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was sent to lead the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, it is written that the Lord appeared to him thus: <q>Now <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Midian: and he led the flock to the back side of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and came to the mountain of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even to Horeb. And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire, out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of your father, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob.</q>  He is here also first called the Angel of the Lord, and then God. Was an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, then, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob? Therefore He may be rightly understood to be the Saviour Himself, of whom the apostle says, <q>Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.</q>  He, therefore, <q>who is over all, God blessed for ever,</q> is not unreasonably here understood also to be Himself the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob. But why is He previously called the Angel of the Lord, when He appeared in a flame of fire out of the bush? Was it because it was one of many <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who by an economy [or arrangement] bare the person of his Lord? Or was something of the creature assumed by Him in order to bring about a visible appearance for the business in hand, and that words might thence be audibly uttered, whereby the presence of the Lord might be shown, in such way as was fitting, to the corporeal senses of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by means of the creature made subject? For if he was one of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who could easily affirm whether it was the person of the Son which was imposed upon him to announce, or that of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, or that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or altogether of the Trinity itself, who is the one and only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that he might say, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob?</q> For we cannot say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob, and that the Father is not; nor will any one dare to deny that either the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, or the Trinity itself, whom we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and understand to be the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob. For he who is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of those fathers. Furthermore, if not only the Father is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as all, even <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, admit; but also the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, which, whether they will or not, they are compelled to acknowledge, since the apostle says, <q>Who is over all, God blessed for ever;</q> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, since the same apostle says, <q>Therefore glorify God in your body;</q> when he had said above, <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your body is the temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which is in you, which you have of God?</q>  and these three are one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as Catholic soundness believes: it is not sufficiently apparent which person of the Trinity that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> bare, if he was one of the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and whether any person, and not rather that of the Trinity itself. But if the creature was assumed for the purpose of the business in hand, whereby both to appear to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> eyes, and to sound in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> ears, and to be called the Angel of the Lord, and the Lord, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; then cannot God here be understood to be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but either the Son or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Although I cannot call to mind that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is anywhere else called an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, which yet may be understood from His work; for it is said of Him, <q>And He will show you  things to come;</q>  and <q><a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a></q> in Greek is certainly equivalent to <q>messenger</q>  in Latin: but we read most evidently of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, that He is called <q>the Angel of Great Counsel,</q>  while both the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is God and Lord of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; Of the Appearance in the Pillar of Cloud and of Fire.</h2>

<p>24. Also in the going forth of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> it is written, <q>And the Lord went before them, by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire. He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.</q>  Who here, too, would <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that God appeared to the eyes of mortal men by the corporeal creature made subject to Him, and not by His own substance? But it is not similarly apparent whether the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, or the Trinity itself, the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>. Nor is this distinguished there either, in my judgment, where it is written, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord appeared in the cloud, and the Lord spoke unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying, I have heard the murmurings of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,</q>  etc.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; Of the Appearance on Sinai. Whether the Trinity Spoke in that Appearance or Some One Person Specially.</h2>

<p>25. But now of the clouds, and voices, and lightnings, and the trumpet, and the smoke on Mount Sinai, when it was said, <q>And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire, and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace; and all the people that was in the camp trembled; and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> spoke, and God answered him by a voice.</q>  And a little after, when the Law had been given in the ten commandments, it follows in the text, <q>And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking.</q> And a little after, <q>And [when the people saw it,] they removed and stood afar off, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> drew near unto the thick darkness  where God was, and the Lord said unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>,</q>  etc. What shall I say about this, save that no one can be so insane as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the smoke, and the fire, and the cloud, and the darkness, and whatever there was of the kind, to be the substance of the word and wisdom of God which is Christ, or of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? For not even the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> ever dared to say that they were the substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. All these things, then, were wrought through the creature serving the Creator, and were presented in a suitable economy (<em>dispensatio</em>) to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> senses; unless, perhaps, because it is said, <q>And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> drew near to the cloud where God was,</q> carnal thoughts must needs suppose that the cloud was indeed seen by the people, but that within the cloud <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> with the eyes of the flesh saw the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, whom doting <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> will have to be seen in His own substance. Forsooth, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> may have seen Him with the eyes of the flesh, if not only the wisdom of God which is Christ, but even that of any man you please and howsoever wise, can be seen with the eyes of the flesh; or if, because it is written of the elders of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that <q>they saw the place where the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had stood,</q> and that <q>there was under His feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness,</q>  therefore we are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the word and wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His own substance stood within the space of an earthly place, who indeed <q>reaches firmly from end to end, and sweetly orders all things;</q>  and that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, by whom all things were made,  is in such wise changeable, as now to contract, now to expand Himself; (may the Lord cleanse the hearts of His faithful ones from such thoughts!) But indeed all these visible and sensible things are, as we have often said, exhibited through the creature made subject in order to signify the invisible and intelligible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not only the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but also the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, <q>of whom are all things, and through whom are all things, and in whom are all things;</q>  although <q>the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power and Godhead.</q> </p>

<p>26. But as far as concerns our present undertaking, neither on Mount Sinai do I see how it appears, by all those things which were fearfully displayed to the senses of mortal men, whether God the Trinity spoke, or the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> severally. But if it is allowable, without rash assertion, to venture upon a modest and hesitating conjecture from this passage, if it is possible to understand it of one person of the Trinity, why do we not rather understand the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to be spoken of, since the Law itself also, which was given there, is said to have been written upon tables of stone with the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  by which name we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to be signified in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.  And fifty days are numbered from the slaying of the lamb and the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> until the day in which these things began to be done in Mount Sinai; just as after the passion of our Lord fifty days are numbered from His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, and then came the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> had promised. And in that very coming of His, which we read of in the Acts of the Apostles, there appeared cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them:  which agrees with Exodus, where it is written, <q>And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire;</q> and a little after, <q>And the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord,</q> he says, <q>was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q>  Or if these things were therefore wrought because neither the Father nor the Son could be there presented in that mode without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, by whom the Law itself must needs be written; then we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> doubtless that God appeared there, not by His own substance, which remains invisible and unchangeable, but by the appearance above mentioned of the creature; but that some special person of the Trinity appeared, distinguished by a proper mark, as far as my capacity of understanding reaches, we do not see.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; In What Manner Moses Saw God.</h2>

<p>26. There is yet another difficulty which troubles most people, <em>viz</em>. that it is written, <q>And the Lord spoke unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> face to face, as a man speaks unto his friend;</q> whereas a little after, the same <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says, <q>Now therefore, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> You, if I have found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in Your sight, show me now Yourself plainly, that I may see You, that I may find <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in Your sight, and that I may consider that this nation is Your people;</q> and a little after <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> again said to the Lord, <q>Show me Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> What means this then, that in everything which was done, as above said, God was thought to have appeared by His own substance; whence the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has been <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by these miserable people to be visible not by the creature, but by Himself; and that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, entering into the cloud, appeared to have had this very object in entering, that a cloudy darkness indeed might be shown to the eyes of the people, but that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> within might hear the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as though he beheld His face; and, as it is said, <q>And the Lord spoke unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> face to face, as a man speaks unto his friend;</q> and yet, behold, the same <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says, <q>If I have found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in Your sight, show me Yourself plainly?</q> Assuredly he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he saw corporeally, and he sought the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sight of God spiritually. And that mode of speech accordingly which was wrought in words, was so modified, as if it were of a friend speaking to a friend. Yet who sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father with the eyes of the body? And that Word, which was in the beginning, the Word which was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Word which was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which all things were made, &mdash; who sees Him with the eyes of the body? And the spirit of wisdom, again, who sees with the eyes of the body? Yet what is, <q>Show me now Yourself plainly, that I may see You,</q> unless, Show me Your substance? But if <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had not said this, we must indeed have borne with those foolish people as we could, who think that the substance of God was made visible to his eyes through those things which, as above mentioned, were said or done. But when it is here demonstrated most evidently that this was <em>not granted</em> to him, even though he desired it; who will dare to say, that by the like forms which had appeared visibly to him also, not the creature serving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that itself which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, appeared to the eyes of a mortal man?</p>

<p>28. Add, too, that which the Lord afterward said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>You can not see my face: for there shall no man see my face, and live. And the Lord said, Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand upon a rock: and it shall come to pass, while my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> passes by, that I will put you into a watchtower  of the rock, and will cover you with my hand while I pass by: and I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back parts; but my face shall not be seen.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 17.&mdash; How the Back Parts of God Were Seen. The Faith of the Resurrection of Christ. The Catholic Church Only is the Place from Whence the Back Parts of God are Seen. The Back Parts of God Were Seen by the Israelites. It is a Rash Opinion to Think that God the Father Only Was Never Seen by the Fathers.</h2>

<p>Not unfitly is it commonly understood to be prefigured from the person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, that His <q>back parts</q> are to be taken to be His flesh, in which He was born of the Virgin, and died, and rose again; whether they are called back parts  on account of the posteriority of mortality, or because it was almost in the end of the world, that is, at a late period,  that He deigned to take it: but that His <q>face</q> was that form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in which He <q>thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  which no one certainly can see and live; whether because after this life, in which we are absent from the Lord,  and where the corruptible body presses down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,  we shall see <q>face to face,</q>  as the apostle says&mdash; (for it is said in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, of this life, <q>Verily every man living is altogether vanity;</q>  and again, <q>For in Your sight shall no man living be justified;</q>  and in this life also, according to John, <q>It does not yet appear what we shall be, but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> he says, <q>that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is,</q>  which he certainly intended to be understood as after this life, when we shall have paid the debt of death, and shall have received the promise of the resurrection);&mdash; or whether that even now, in whatever degree we spiritually understand the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which all things were made, in that same degree we die to carnal affections, so that, considering this world dead to us, we also ourselves die to this world, and say what the apostle says, <q>The world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</q>  For it was of this death that he also says, <q>Wherefore, if you be dead with Christ, why as though living in the world are you subject to ordinances?</q>  Not therefore without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> will no one be able to see the <q>face,</q> that is, the manifestation itself of the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and live. For it is this very appearance, for the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of which every one sighs who strives to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God with all his heart, and with all his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with all his mind; to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of which, he who loves his neighbor, too, as himself builds up his neighbor also as far as he may; on which two commandments hang all the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.  And this is signified also in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself. For when he had said, on account of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God with which he was specially inflamed, <q>If I have found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in your sight, show me now Yourself plainly, that I may find <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in Your sight;</q> he immediately subjoined, on account of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> also of his neighbor, <q>And that I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this nation is Your people.</q> It is therefore that <q>appearance</q> which hurries away every rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the desire of it, and the more ardently the more pure that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is; and it is the more pure the more it rises to spiritual things; and it rises the more to spiritual things the more it dies to carnal things. But while we are absent from the Lord, and walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not by sight,  we ought to see the <q>back parts</q> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is His flesh, by that very <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that is, standing on the solid foundation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which the rock signifies,  and beholding it from such a safe watchtower, namely in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of which it is said, <q>And upon this rock I will build my Church.</q>  For so much the more certainly we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that face of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which we earnestly desire to see, as we recognize in His back parts how much first Christ loved us.</p>

<p>29. But in the flesh itself, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> saves and justifies us. For, <q>If you shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</q> he says, <q>in your heart, that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved;</q>  and again, <q>Who was delivered,</q> he says, <q>for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification.</q>  So that the reward of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the resurrection of the body of our Lord.  For even His enemies <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that that flesh died on the cross of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, but they do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it to have risen again. Which we believing most firmly, gaze upon it as from the solidity of a rock: whence we wait with certain hope for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body;  because we hope for that in the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is, in ourselves, which by a sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we acknowledge to be perfect in Him as in our Head. Thence it is that He would not have His back parts seen, unless as He passed by, that His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> may be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. For that which is Pascha in Hebrew, is translated <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>.  Whence John the Evangelist also says, <q>Before the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">feast of the Passover</a>, when Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that His hour had come, that He should pass out of this world unto the Father.</q> </p>

<p>30. But they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it not in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but in some <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> or in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, do not see the back parts of the Lord from <q>the place that is by Him.</q> For what does that mean which the Lord says, <q>Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand upon a rock?</q> What earthly place is <q>by</q> the Lord, unless that is <q>by Him</q> which touches Him spiritually? For what place is not <q>by</q> the Lord, who <q>reaches from one end to another mightily, and sweetly does order all things,</q>  and of whom it is said, <q><a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> is His throne, and earth is His footstool;</q> and who said, <q>Where is the house that you build unto me, and where is the place of my rest? For has not my hand made all those things?</q>  But manifestly the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself is understood to be <q>the place by Him,</q> wherein one stands upon a rock, where he healthfully sees the <q>Pascha Domini,</q> that is, the <q>Passing by</q>  of the Lord, and His back parts, that is, His body, who believes in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. <q>And you shall stand,</q> He says, <q>upon a rock while my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> passes by.</q> For in reality, immediately after the majesty of the Lord had passed by in the glorification of the Lord, in which He rose again and ascended to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, we stood firm upon the rock. And Peter himself then stood firm, so that he preached Him with confidence, whom, before he stood firm, he had thrice from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> denied;  although, indeed, already before placed in <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> upon the watchtower of the rock, but with the hand of the Lord still held over him that he might not see. For he was to see His back parts, and the Lord had not yet <q>passed by,</q> namely, from death to life; He had not yet been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the resurrection.</p>

<p>31. For as to that, too, which follows in Exodus, <q>I will cover you with mine hand while I pass by, and I will take away my hand and you shall see my back parts;</q> many <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, of whom <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was then a figure, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the Lord after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, as if His hand had been taken off from their eyes, and they now saw His back parts. And hence the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> also mentions that prophesy of Isaiah, <q>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes.</q>  Lastly, in the Psalm, that is not unreasonably understood to be said in their person, <q>For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me.</q> <q>By day,</q> perhaps, when He performed manifest <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, yet was not acknowledged by them; but <q>by night,</q> when He died in suffering, when they thought still more certainly that, like any one among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, He was cut off and brought to an end. But since, when He had already passed by, so that His back parts were seen, upon the preaching to them by the Apostle Peter that it behooved Christ to suffer and rise again, they were pricked in their hearts with the grief of repentance,  that that might come to pass among the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> which is said in the beginning of that Psalm, <q>Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are covered;</q> therefore, after it had been said, <q>Your hand is heavy upon me,</q> the Lord, as it were, passing by, so that now He removed His hand, and His back parts were seen, there follows the voice of one who grieves and confesses and receives remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the resurrection of the Lord: <q>My moisture,</q> he says, <q>is turned into the drought of summer. I acknowledged my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unto You, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord, and You forgave the iniquity of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q>  For we ought not to be so wrapped up in the darkness of the flesh, as to think the face indeed of God to be invisible, but His back visible, since both appeared visibly in the form of a servant; but far be it from us to think anything of the kind in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; far be it from us to think that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> and the Wisdom of God has a face on one side, and on the other a back, as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body has, or is at all changed either in place or time by any appearance or motion. </p>

<p>32. Wherefore, if in those words which were spoken in Exodus, and in all those corporeal appearances, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> was manifested; or if in some cases Christ was manifested, as the consideration of this passage persuades us, in others the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as that which we have said above admonishes us; at any rate no such result follows, as that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father never appeared in any such form to the Fathers. For many such appearances happened in those times, without either the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> being expressly named and designated in them; but yet with some intimations given through certain very probable interpretations, so that it would be too rash to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father never appeared by any visible forms to the fathers or the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For they gave birth to this opinion who were not able to understand in respect to the unity of the Trinity such texts as, <q>Now unto the King <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, invisible, the only wise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q>  and, <q>Whom no man has seen, nor can see.</q>  Which texts are understood by a sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in that substance itself, the highest, and in the highest degree divine and unchangeable, whereby both the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is the one and only God. But those visions were wrought through the changeable creature, made subject to the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and did not manifest God properly as He is, but by intimations such as suited the causes and times of the several circumstances.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; The Vision of Daniel.</h2>

<p>33.  I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what manner these men understand that the <a href="../cathen/01463a.htm">Ancient of Days</a> appeared to Daniel, from whom the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, which He deigned to be for our sakes, is understood to have received the kingdom; namely, from Him who says to Him in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <q>You are my Son; this day have I begotten You; ask of me, and I shall give You the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> for Your inheritance;</q>  and who has <q>put all things under His feet.</q>  If, however, both the Father giving the kingdom, and the Son receiving it, appeared to Daniel in bodily form, how can those men say that the Father never appeared to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and, therefore, that He only ought to be understood to be invisible whom no man has seen, nor can see? For Daniel has told us thus: <q>I beheld,</q> he says, <q>till the thrones were set,  and the <a href="../cathen/01463a.htm">Ancient of Days</a> did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head like the pure wool: His throne was like the fiery flame, and His wheels as burning fire; a fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him: thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened,</q> etc. And a little after, <q>I saw,</q> he says, <q>in the night visions, and behold, one like the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the <a href="../cathen/01463a.htm">Ancient of Days</a>, and they brought Him near before Him. And there was given Him dominion, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him: His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</q>  Behold the Father giving, and the Son receiving, an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> kingdom; and both are in the sight of him who prophesies, in a visible form. It is not, therefore, unsuitably <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father also was wont to appear in that manner to mortals.</p>

<p>34. Unless, perhaps, some one shall say, that the Father is therefore not visible, because He appeared within the sight of one who was dreaming; but that therefore the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are visible, because <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> saw all those things being awake; as if, forsooth, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> saw the Word and the Wisdom of God with fleshly eyes, or that even the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> spirit which quickens that flesh can be seen, or even that corporeal thing which is called wind&mdash;how much less can that <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> be seen, who transcends the minds of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, by the ineffable excellence of the divine substance? Or can any one fall headlong into such an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> as to dare to say, that the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are visible also to men who are awake, but that the Father is not visible except to those who dream? How, then, do they understand that of the Father alone, <q>Whom no man has seen, nor can see.</q>? When men sleep, are they then not men? Or cannot He, who can fashion the likeness of a body to signify Himself through the visions of dreamers, also fashion that same bodily creature to signify Himself to the eyes of those who are awake? Whereas His own very substance, whereby He Himself is that which He is, cannot be shown by any bodily likeness to one who sleeps, or by any bodily appearance to one who is awake; but this not of the Father only, but also of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. And certainly, as to those who are moved by the visions of waking men to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but only the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, appeared to the corporeal sight of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>&mdash;to omit the great extent of the sacred pages, and their manifold interpretation, such that no one of sound reason ought to affirm that the person of the Father was nowhere shown to the eyes of waking men by any corporeal appearance&mdash;but, as I said, to omit this, what do they say of our father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, who was certainly awake and ministering, when, after Scripture had premised, <q>The Lord appeared unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,</q> not one, or two, but three men appeared to him; no one of whom is said to have stood prominently above the others, no one more than the others to have shone with greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, or to have acted more authoritatively? </p>

<p>35. Wherefore, since in that our threefold division we determined to inquire,  first, whether the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; or whether sometimes the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, sometimes the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, sometimes the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; or whether, without any distinction of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as it is said, the one and only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, the Trinity itself, appeared to the fathers through those forms of the creature: now that we have examined, so far as appeared to be sufficient what places of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> we could, a modest and cautious consideration of divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> leads, as far as I can judge, to no other conclusion, unless that we may not rashly affirm which person of the Trinity appeared to this or that of the fathers or the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in some body or likeness of body, unless when the context attaches to the narrative some probable intimations on the subject. For the nature itself, or substance, or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, or by whatever other name that very thing, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whatever it be, is to be called, cannot be seen corporeally: but we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that by means of the creature made subject to Him, not only the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but also the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, may have given intimations of Himself to mortal senses by a corporeal form or likeness. And since the case stands thus, that this second book may not extend to an immoderate length, let us consider what remains in those which follow.</p>
