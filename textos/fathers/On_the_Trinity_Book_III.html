<h1>On the Trinity (Book III)</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">The question is discussed with respect to the appearances of God spoken of in the previous book, which were made under bodily forms, whether only a creature was formed, for the purpose of manifesting God to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sight in such way as He at each time judged fitting; or whether <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, already existing, were so sent as to speak in the person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this, either by assuming a bodily appearance from the bodily creature, or by changing their own bodies into whatever forms they would, suitable to the particular action, according to the power given to them by the Creator; while the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> itself of God was never seen in itself.</span> </p>

<h2>Preface.&mdash; Why Augustine Writes of the Trinity. What He Claims from Readers. What Has Been Said in the Previous Book.</h2>

<p>1. I Would have them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, who are willing to do so, that I had rather bestow labor in reading, than in dictating what others may read. But let those who will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this, but are both able and willing to make the trial, grant me whatever answers may be gathered from reading, either to my own inquiries, or to those interrogations of others, which for the character I bear in the service of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and for the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> with which I burn that our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be fortified against the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of carnal and natural men,  I must needs bear with; and then let them see how easily I would refrain from this labor, and with how much even of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> I would give my pen a holiday. But if what we have read upon these subjects is either not sufficiently set forth, or is not to be found at all, or at any rate cannot easily be found by us, in the Latin tongue, while we are not so familiar with the Greek tongue as to be found in any way competent to read and understand therein the books that treat of such topics, in which class of writings, to judge by the little which has been translated for us, I do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that everything is contained that we can profitably seek;  while yet I cannot resist my brethren when they exact of me, by that law by which I am made their servant, that I should minister above all to their praiseworthy studies in Christ by my tongue and by my pen, of which two yoked together in me, Love is the charioteer; and while I myself confess that I have by writing learned many things which I did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: if this be so, then this my labor ought not to seem superfluous to any idle, or to any very learned reader; while it is needful in no small part, to many who are busy, and to many who are unlearned,and among these last to myself. Supported, then, very greatly, and aided by the writings we have already read of others on this subject, I have undertaken to inquire into and to discuss, whatever it seems to my judgment can be reverently inquired into and discussed, concerning the Trinity, the one supreme and supremely good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; He himself exhorting me to the inquiry, and helping me in the discussion of it; in order that, if there are no other writings of the kind, there may be something for those to have and read who are willing and capable; but if any exist already, then it may be so much the easier to find some such writings, the more there are of the kind in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.</p>

<p>2. Assuredly, as in all my writings I desire not only a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> reader, but also a free corrector, so I especially desire this in the present inquiry, which is so important that I would there were as many inquirers as there are objectors. But as I do not wish my reader to be bound down to me, so I do not wish my corrector to be bound down to himself. Let not the former <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me more than the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, let not the latter <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> himself more than the catholic verity. As I say to the former, Do not be willing to yield to my writings as to the canonical Scriptures; but in these, when you have discovered even what you did not previously <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it unhesitatingly; while in those, unless you have understood with certainty what you did not before hold as certain, be unwilling to hold it fast: so I say to the latter, Do not be willing to amend my writings by your own opinion or disputation, but from the divine text, or by unanswerable reason. If you apprehend anything of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in them, its being there does not make it mine, but by understanding and loving it, let it be both yours and mine; but if you convict anything of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, though it have once been mine, in that I was guilty of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, yet now by avoiding it let it be neither yours nor mine.</p>

<p>3. Let this third book, then, take its beginning at the point to which the second had reached. For after we had arrived at this, that we desired to show that the Son was not therefore less than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because the Father sent and the Son was sent; nor the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> therefore less than both, because we read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that He was sent both by the one and by the other; we undertook then to inquire, since the Son was sent there, where He already was, for He came into the world, and <q>was in the world;</q>  since also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was sent there, where He already was, for <q>the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> fills the world, and that which contains all things has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the voice;</q>  whether the Lord was therefore <q>sent</q> because He was born in the flesh so as to be no longer hidden, and, as it were, came forth from the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and appeared to the eyes of men in the form of a servant; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also was therefore <q>sent,</q> because He too was seen as a dove in a corporeal form,  and in cloven tongues, like as of fire;  so that, to be sent, when spoken of them, means to go forth to the sight of mortals in some corporeal form from a spiritual hiding-place; which, because the Father did not, He is said only to have sent, not also to be sent. Our next inquiry was, Why the Father also is not sometimes said to be sent, if He Himself was manifested through those corporeal forms which appeared to the eyes of the ancients. But if the Son was manifested at these times, why should He be said to be <q>sent</q> so long after, when the fullness of time had come that He should be born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>;  since, indeed, He was sent before also, <em>viz</em>., when He appeared corporeally in those forms? Or if He were not rightly said to be <q>sent,</q> except when the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>;  why should the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> be read of as <q>sent,</q> of whom such an <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> never took place? But if neither the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was manifested through these ancient appearances; why should He too be said to be <q>sent</q> now, when He was also sent before in these various manners? Next we subdivided the subject, that it might be handled most carefully, and we made the question threefold, of which one part was explained in the second book, and two remain, which I shall next proceed to discuss. For we have already inquired and determined, that not only the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor only the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, nor only the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> appeared in those ancient corporeal forms and visions, but either indifferently the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, who is understood to be the Trinity itself, or some one person of the Trinity, whichever the text of the narrative might signify, through intimations supplied by the context.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; What is to Be Said Thereupon.</h2>

<p>4. Let us, then, continue our inquiry now in order. For under the second head in that division the question occurred, whether the creature was formed for that work only, wherein <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in such way as He then judged it to be fitting, might be manifested to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sight; or whether <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, were so sent as to speak in the person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, assuming a corporeal appearance from the corporeal creature for the purpose of their ministry; or else changing and turning their own body itself, to which they are not subject, but govern it as subject to themselves, into whatever forms they would, that were appropriate and fit for their actions, according to the power given to them by the Creator. And when this part of the question shall have been investigated, so far as God permit, then, lastly,  we shall have to see to that question with which we started, <em>viz</em>., whether the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> were also <q>sent</q> before; and if it be so, then what difference there is between that sending and the one of which we read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; or whether neither of them were sent, except when either the Son was made of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, or when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> appeared in a visible form, whether as a dove or in tongues of fire. </p>

<p>5. I confess, however, that it reaches further than my purpose can carry me to inquire whether the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, secretly working by the spiritual quality of their body abiding still in them, assume somewhat from the inferior and more bodily elements, which, being fitted to themselves, they may change and turn like a garment into any corporeal appearances they will, and those appearances themselves also real, as real water was changed by our Lord into real wine;  or whether they transform their own bodies themselves into that which they would, suitably to the particular act. But it does not signify to the present question which of these it is. And although I be not able to understand these things by actual experience, seeing that I am a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do who do these things, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them better than I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, <em>viz</em>., how far my body is changeable by the operation of my will; whether it be by my own experience of myself, or by that which I have gathered from others; yet it is not necessary here to say which of these alternatives I am to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> upon the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, lest I be compelled to prove it, and so my discourse become too long upon a subject which does not concern the present question.</p>

<p>6. Our present inquiry then is, whether the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were then the agents both in showing those bodily appearances to the eyes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and in sounding those words in their ears when the sensible creature itself, serving the Creator at His beck, was turned for the time into whatever was needful; as it is written in the book of Wisdom, <q>For the creature serves You, who art the Maker, increases his strength against the unrighteous for their punishment, and abates his strength for the benefit of such as put their trust in You. Therefore, even then was it altered into all fashions, and was <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that nourishes all things according to the desire of them that longed for You.</q>  For the power of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> reaches through the spiritual creature even to visible and sensible effects of the corporeal creature. For where does not the wisdom of the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> God work that which He wills, which <q>reaches from one end to another mightily, and sweetly does order all things</q>? </p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; The Will of God is the Higher Cause of All Corporeal Change. This is Shown by an Example.</h2>

<p>7. But there is one kind of natural order in the conversion and changeableness of bodies, which, although itself also serves the bidding of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet by reason of its unbroken continuity has ceased to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> wonder; as is the case, for instance, with those things which are changed either in very short, or at any rate not long, intervals of time, in heaven, or earth, or sea; whether it be in rising, or in setting, or in change of appearance from time to time; while there are other things, which, although arising from that same order, yet are less familiar on account of longer intervals of time. And these things, although the many stupidly wonder at them, yet are understood by those who inquire into this present world, and in the progress of generations become so much the less wonderful, as they are the more often repeated and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by more people. Such are the eclipses of the sun and moon, and some kinds of stars, appearing seldom, and earthquakes, and unnatural births of living creatures, and other similar things; of which not one takes place without the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; yet, that it is so, is to most people not apparent. And so the vanity of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> has found license to assign these things also to other causes, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> causes perhaps, but proximate ones, while they are not able to see at all the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that is higher than all others, that is, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; or again to false causes, and to such as are not even put forward out of any diligent investigation of corporeal things and motions, but from their own guess and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>

<p>8. I will bring forward an example, if I can, that this may be plainer. There is, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, a certain bulk of flesh and an outward form, and an arrangement and distraction of limbs, and a temperament of health; and a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> breathed into it governs this body, and that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a rational one; which, therefore, although changeable, yet can be partaker of that unchangeable wisdom, so that <q>it may partake of that which is in and of itself;</q>  as it is written in the Psalm concerning all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, of whom as of living stones is built that Jerusalem which is the mother of us all, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in the heavens. For so it is sung, <q>Jerusalem is built as a city, that is partaker of that which is in and of itself.</q>  For <q>in and of itself,</q> in that place, is understood of that chiefest and unchangeable good, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of His own wisdom and will. To whom is sung in another place, <q>You shall change them, and they shall be changed; but You are the same.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; Of the Same Argument.</h2>

<p>Let us take, then, the case of a wise man, such that his rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is already partaker of the unchangeable and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so that he consults it about all his actions, nor does anything at all, which he does not by it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ought to be done, in order that by being subject to it and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> it he may do rightly. Suppose now that this man, upon counsel with the highest reason of the divine righteousness, which he hears with the ear of his heart in secret, and by its bidding, should weary his body by toil in some office of mercy, and should contract an illness; and upon consulting the physicians, were to be told by one that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the disease was overmuch dryness of the body, but by another that it was overmuch moisture; one of the two no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> would allege the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and the other would <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, but both would pronounce concerning proximate causes only, that is, corporeal ones. But if the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that dryness were to be inquired into, and found to be the self-imposed toil, then we should have come to a yet higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> so as to affect the body which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> governs. Yet neither would this be the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, for that doubtless was a higher <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> still, and lay in the unchangeable wisdom itself, by serving which in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> its ineffable commands, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the wise man had undertaken that self-imposed toil; and so nothing else but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would be found most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to be the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that illness. But suppose now in that office of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> toil this wise man had employed the help of others to co-operate in the good work, who did not serve God with the same will as himself, but either desired to attain the reward of their own carnal desires, or shunned merely carnal unpleasantnesses;&mdash; suppose, too, he had employed beasts of burden, if the completion of the work required such a provision, which beasts of burden would be certainly irrational animals, and would not therefore move their limbs under their burdens because they at all thought of that good work, but from the natural appetite of their own liking, and for the avoiding of annoyance&mdash;suppose, lastly, he had employed bodily things themselves that lack all sense, but were necessary for that work, as <em>e.g</em>. grain, and wine, and oils, clothes, or money, or a book, or anything of the kind&mdash;certainly, in all these bodily things thus employed in this work, whether animate or inanimate, whatever took place of movement, of wear and tear, of reparation, of destruction, of renewal or of change in one way or another, as places and times affected them; <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, could there be, I say, any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all these visible and changeable facts, except the invisible and unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, using all these, both bad and irrational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and lastly bodies, whether such as were inspired and animated by those <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, or such as lacked all sense, by means of that upright <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as the seat of His wisdom, since primarily that good and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself employed them, which His wisdom had subjected to itself in a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and religious <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; God Uses All Creatures as He Will, and Makes Visible Things for the Manifestation of Himself.</h2>

<p>9. What, then, we have alleged by way of example of a single wise man, although of one still bearing a mortal body and still seeing only in part, may be allowably extended also to a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, where there is a society of such men, or to a city, or even to the whole world, if the chief rule and government of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs were in the hands of the wise, and of those who were piously and perfectly subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but because this is not the case as yet (for it behooves us first to be exercised in this our pilgrimage after mortal fashion, and to be taught with stripes by force of gentleness and patience), let us turn our thoughts to that country itself that is above and heavenly, from which we here are pilgrims. For there the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>who makes His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> spirits, and His ministers a flaming fire,</q>  presiding among spirits which are joined in perfect peace and friendship, and combined in one will by a kind of spiritual fire of charity, as it were in an elevated and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and secret seat, as in its own house and in its own temple, thence diffuses itself through all things by certain most perfectly  ordered movements of the creature; first spiritual, then corporeal; and uses all according to the unchangeable pleasure of its own purpose, whether incorporeal things or things corporeal, whether rational or irrational spirits, whether good by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> through their own will. But as the more gross and inferior bodies are governed in due order by the more subtle and powerful ones, so all bodies are governed by the living spirit; and the living spirit devoid of reason, by the reasonable living spirit; and the reasonable living spirit that makes default and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, by the living and reasonable spirit that is <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and just; and that by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, and so the universal creature by its Creator, from whom and through whom and in whom it is also created and established.  And so it comes to pass that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the first and the highest <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all corporeal appearances and motions. For nothing is done visibly or sensibly, unless either by command or permission from the interior palace, invisible and intelligible, of the supreme Governor, according to the unspeakable <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of rewards and punishments, of favor and retribution, in that far-reaching and boundless commonwealth of the whole creature.</p>

<p>10. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, although he still bare the burden of the body, which is subject to corruption and presses down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,  and although he still saw only in part and in an enigma,  wishing to depart and be with Christ,  and groaning within himself, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of his body,  yet was able to preach the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> significantly, in one way by his tongue, in another by epistle, in another by the sacrament of His body and blood (since, certainly, we do not call either the tongue of the apostle, or the parchments, or the ink, or the significant sounds which his tongue uttered, or the alphabetical signs written on skins, the body and blood of Christ; but that only which we take of the fruits of the earth and consecrate by mystic <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and then receive duly to our spiritual health in memory of the passion of our Lord for us: and this, although it is brought by the hands of men to that visible form, yet is not sanctified to become so great a sacrament, except by the spirit of God working invisibly; since God works everything that is done in that work through corporeal movements, by setting in motion primarily the invisible things of His servants, whether the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or the services of hidden spirits subject to Himself): what wonder if also in the creature of heaven and earth, of sea and air, God works the sensible and visible things which He wills, in order to signify and manifest Himself in them, as He Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it to be fitting, without any appearing of His very substance itself, whereby He is, which is altogether unchangeable, and more inwardly and secretly exalted than all spirits whom He has created?</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; Why Miracles are Not Usual Works.</h2>

<p>11. For since the divine power administers the whole spiritual and corporeal creature, the waters of the sea are summoned and poured out upon the face of the earth on certain days of every year. But when this was done at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Elijah; because so continued and long a course of fair weather had gone before, that men were famished; and because at that very hour, in which the servant of God <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, the air itself had not, by any moist aspect, put forth signs of the coming rain; the divine power was apparent in the great and rapid showers that followed, and by which that <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> was granted and dispensed.  In like manner, God works ordinarily through thunders and lightnings: but because these were wrought in an unusual manner on Mount Sinai, and those sounds were not uttered with a confused noise, but so that it appeared by most sure <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> that certain intimations were given by them, they were <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.  Who draws up the sap through the root of the vine to the bunch of grapes, and makes the wine, except <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; who, while man plants and waters, Himself gives the increase?  But when, at the command of the Lord, the water was turned into wine with an extraordinary quickness, the divine power was made manifest, by the confession even of the foolish.  Who ordinarily clothes the trees with leaves and flowers except God? Yet, when the rod of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> blossomed, the Godhead in some way conversed with doubting humanity.  Again, the earthy matter certainly serves in common to the production and formation both of all kinds of wood and of the flesh of all animals: and who makes these things, but He who said, Let the earth bring them forth;  and who governs and guides by the same word of His, those things which He has created? Yet, when He changed the same matter out of the rod of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> into the flesh of a serpent, immediately and quickly, that change, which was unusual, although of a thing which was changeable, was a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>.  But who is it that gives life to every living thing at its birth, unless He who gave life to that serpent also for the moment, as there was need. </p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; Diversity Alone Makes a Miracle.</h2>

<p>And who is it that restored to the corpses their proper <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> when the dead rose again,  unless He who gives life to the flesh in the mother's womb, in order that they may come into being who yet are to die? But when such things happen in a continuous kind of river of ever-flowing succession, passing from the hidden to the visible, and from the visible to the hidden, by a regular and beaten track, then they are called natural; when, for the admonition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they are thrust in by an unusual changeableness, then they are called <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; Great Miracles Wrought by Magic Arts.</h2>

<p>12. I see here what may occur to a weak judgment, namely, why such <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are wrought also by magic arts; for the wise men of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> likewise made serpents, and did other like things. Yet it is still more a matter of wonder, how it was that the power of those magicians, which was able to make serpents, when it came to very small flies, failed altogether. For the lice, by which third plague the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> people of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> were smitten, are very short-lived little flies; yet there certainly the magicians failed, saying, <q>This is the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  And hence it is given us to understand that not even those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and powers of the air that transgressed, who have been thrust down into that lowest darkness, as into a peculiar <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, from their habitation in that lofty ethereal purity, through whom magic arts have whatever power they have, can do anything except by power given from above. Now that power is given either to deceive the deceitful, as it was given against the Egyptians, and against the magicians also themselves, in order that in the seducing of those spirits they might seem admirable by whom they were wrought, but to be condemned by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; or for the admonishing of the faithful, lest they should desire to do anything of the kind as though it were a great thing, for which reason they have been handed down to us also by the authority of Scripture; or lastly, for the exercising, proving, and manifesting of the patience of the righteous. For it was not by any small power of visible <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that Job lost all that he had, and both his children and his bodily health itself. </p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; God Alone Creates Those Things Which are Changed by Magic Art.</h2>

<p>13. Yet it is not on this account to be thought that the matter of visible things is subservient to the bidding of those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; but rather to that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whom this power is given, just so far as He, who is unchangeable, determines in His lofty and spiritual abode to give it. For water and fire and earth are subservient even to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, who are condemned to the mines, in order that they may do therewith what they will, but only so far as is permitted. Nor, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, are those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to be called creators, because by their means the magicians, withstanding the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, made frogs and serpents; for it was not they who created them. But, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, some hidden seeds of all things that are born corporeally and visibly, are concealed in the corporeal elements of this world. For those seeds that are visible now to our eyes from fruits and living things, are quite distinct from the hidden seeds of those former seeds; from which, at the bidding of the Creator, the water produced the first swimming creatures and fowl, and the earth the first buds after their kind, and the first living creatures after their kind.  For neither at that time were those seeds so drawn forth into products of their several kinds, as that the power of production was exhausted in those products; but oftentimes, suitable combinations of circumstances are wanting, whereby they may be enabled to burst forth and complete their species. For, consider, the very least shoot is a seed; for, if fitly consigned to the earth, it produces a tree. But of this shoot there is a yet more subtle seed in some grain of the same species, and this is visible even to us. But of this grain also there is further still a seed, which, although we are unable to see it with our eyes, yet we can conjecture its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from our reason; because, except there were some such power in those elements, there would not so frequently be produced from the earth things which had not been sown there; nor yet so many animals, without any previous commixture of male and female; whether on the land, or in the water, which yet grow, and by commingling bring forth others, while themselves sprang up without any union of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. And certainly bees do not conceive the seeds of their young by commixture, but gather them as they lie scattered over the earth with their mouth.  For the Creator of these invisible seeds is the Creator of all things Himself; since whatever comes forth to our sight by being born, receives the first beginnings of its course from hidden seeds, and takes the successive increments of its proper size and its distinctive forms from these as it were original rules. As therefore we do not call <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> the creators of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, nor farmers the creators of grain&mdash;although it is by the outward application of their actions that the power  of God operates within for the creating these things&mdash;so it is not right to think not only the bad but even the good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to be creators, if, through the subtlety of their perception and body, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the seeds of things which to us are more hidden, and scatter them secretly through fit temperings of the elements, and so furnish opportunities of producing things, and of accelerating their increase. But neither do the good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do these things, except as far as God commands, nor do the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ones do them wrongfully, except as far as He righteously permits. For the malignity of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one makes his own will wrongful; but the power to do so, he receives rightfully, whether for his own punishment, or, in the case of others, for the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, or for the praise of the good.</p>

<p>14. Accordingly, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, distinguishing God's creating and forming within, from the operations of the creature which are applied from without, and drawing a similitude from agriculture, says, <q>I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</q>  As, therefore, in the case of spiritual life itself, no one except God can work righteousness in our minds, yet men also are able to preach the gospel as an outward means, not only the good in sincerity, but also the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in pretence;  so in the creation of visible things it is God that works from within; but the exterior operations, whether of good or bad, of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or men, or even of any kind of animal, according to His own absolute power, and to the distribution of faculties, and the several appetites for things pleasant, which He Himself has imparted, are applied by Him to that nature of things wherein He creates all things, in like manner as agriculture is to the soil. Wherefore I can no more call the bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, evoked by magic arts, the creators of the frogs and serpents, than I can say that bad men were creators of the grain crop, which I see to have sprung up through their labor.</p>

<p>15. Just as Jacob, again, was not the creator of the colors in the flocks, because he placed the various colored rods for the several mothers, as they drank, to look at in conceiving.  Yet neither were the cattle themselves creators of the variety of their own offspring, because the variegated image, impressed through their eyes by the sight of the varied rods, clave to their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but could affect the body that was animated by the spirit thus affected only through sympathy with this commingling, so far as to stain with color the tender beginnings of their offspring. For that they are so affected from themselves, whether the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body, or the body from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, arises in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from suitable reasons, which immutably exist in that highest wisdom of God Himself, which no extent of place contains; and which, while it is itself unchangeable, yet quits not one even of those things which are changeable, because there is not one of them that is not created by itself. For it was the unchangeable and invisible reason of the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which all things are created, which caused not rods, but cattle, to be born from cattle; but that the color of the cattle conceived should be in any degree influenced by the variety of the rods, came to pass through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the pregnant cattle being affected through their eyes from without, and so according to its own measure drawing inwardly within itself the rule of formation, which it received from the innermost power of its own Creator. How great, however, may be the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in affecting and changing corporeal substance (although certainly it cannot be called the creator of the body, because every <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of changeable and sensible substance, and all its measure and number and weight, by which are brought to pass both its being at all and its being of such and such a nature, arise from the intelligible and unchangeable life, which is above all things, and which reaches even to the most distant and earthly things), is a very copious subject, and one not now necessary. But I thought the act of Jacob about the cattle should be noticed, for this reason, <em>viz</em>. in order that it might be perceived that, if the man who thus placed those rods cannot be called the creator of the colors in the lambs and kids; nor yet even the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> themselves of the mothers, which colored the seeds conceived in the flesh by the image of variegated color, conceived through the eyes of the body, so far as nature permitted it; much less can it be said that the creators of the frogs and serpents were the bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, through whom the magicians of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> then made them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; The Original Cause of All Things is from God.</h2>

<p>16. For it is one thing to make and administer the creature from the innermost and highest turning-point of causation, which He alone does who is God the Creator; but quite another thing to apply some operation from without in proportion to the strength and faculties assigned to each by Him, so that what is created may come forth into being at this time or at that, and in this or that way. For all these things in the way of original and beginning have already been created in a kind of texture of the elements, but they come forth when they get the opportunity.  For as mothers are pregnant with young, so the world itself is pregnant with the causes of things that are born; which are not created in it, except from that highest <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, where nothing either springs up or dies, either begins to be or ceases. But the applying from without of adventitious causes, which, although they are not natural, yet are to be applied according to nature, in order that those things which are contained and hidden in the secret bosom of nature may break forth and be outwardly created in some way by the unfolding of the proper measures and numbers and weights which they have received in secret from Him <q>who has ordered all things in measure and number and weight:</q>  this is not only in the power of bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but also of bad men, as I have shown above by the example of agriculture.</p>

<p>17. But lest the somewhat different condition of animals should trouble any one, in that they have the breath of life with the sense of desiring those things that are according to nature, and of avoiding those things that are contrary to it; we must consider also, how many men there are who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from what herbs or flesh, or from what juices or liquids you please, of whatever sort, whether so placed or so buried, or so bruised or so mixed, this or that animal is commonly born; yet who can be so foolish as to dare to call himself the creator of these animals? Is it, therefore, to be wondered at, if just as any, the most worthless of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence such or such worms and flies are produced; so the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in proportion to the subtlety of their perceptions discern in the more hidden seeds of the elements whence frogs and serpents are produced, and so through certain and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> opportune combinations applying these seeds by secret movements, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to be created, but do not create them? Only men do not marvel at those things that are usually done by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. But if any one chance to wonder at the quickness of those growths, in that those living beings were so quickly made, let him consider how even this may be brought about by men in proportion to the measure of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> capability. For whence is it that the same bodies generate worms more quickly in summer than in winter, or in hotter than in colder places? Only these things are applied by men with so much the more difficulty, in proportion as their earthly and sluggish members are wanting in subtlety of perception, and in rapidity of bodily motion. And hence it arises that in the case of any kind of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in proportion as it is easier for them to draw out the proximate causes from the elements, so much the more marvellous is their rapidity in works of this kind.</p>

<p>18. But He only is the creator who is the chief former of these things. Neither can any one be this, unless He with whom primarily rests the measure, number, and weight of all things existing; and He is God the one Creator, by whose unspeakable power it comes to pass, also, that what these <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were able to do if they were permitted, they are therefore not able to do because they are not permitted. For there is no other reason why they who made frogs and serpents were not able to make the most minute flies, unless because the greater power of God was present prohibiting them, through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; which even the magicians themselves confessed, saying, <q>This is the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  But what they are able to do by nature, yet cannot do, because they are prohibited; and what the very condition of their nature itself does not suffer them to do; it is difficult, nay, impossible, for man to search out, unless through that gift of God which the apostle mentions when he says, <q>To another the discerning of spirits.</q>  For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that a man can walk, yet that he cannot do so if he is not permitted; but that he cannot fly, even if he be permitted. So those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, also, are able to do certain things if they are permitted by more powerful <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, according to the supreme commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but cannot do certain other things, not even if they are permitted by them; because He does not permit from whom they have received such and such a measure of natural powers: who, even by His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, does not usually permit what He has given them power to be able to do.</p>

<p>19. Excepting, therefore, those corporeal things which are done in the order of nature in a perfectly usual series of times, as <em>e.g.</em>, the rising and setting of the stars, the generations and deaths of animals, the innumerable diversities of seeds and buds, the vapors and the clouds, the snow and the rain, the lightnings and the thunder, the thunderbolts and the hail, the winds and the fire, cold and heat, and all like things; excepting also those which in the same order of nature occur rarely, such as eclipses, unusual appearances of stars, and monsters, and earthquakes, and such like&mdash;all these, I say, are to be excepted, of which indeed the first and chief <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is only the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whence also in the Psalm, when some things of this kind had been mentioned, <q>Fire and hail, snow and vapor, stormy wind,</q> lest any one should think those to be brought about either by chance or only from corporeal causes, or even from such as are spiritual, but exist apart from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is added immediately, <q>fulfilling His word.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; In How Many Ways the Creature is to Be Taken by Way of Sign. The Eucharist.</h2>

<p>Excepting, therefore, all these things as I just now said, there are some also of another kind; which, although from the same corporeal substance, are yet brought within reach of our senses in order to announce something from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and these are properly called <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and signs; yet is not the person of God Himself assumed in all things which are announced to us by the Lord God. When, however, that person is assumed, it is sometimes made manifest as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; sometimes in that form which is not an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in his own proper being, although it is ordered and ministered by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Again, when it is assumed in that form which is not an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in his own proper being; sometimes in this case it is a body itself already existing, assumed after some kind of change, in order to make that message manifest; sometimes it is one that comes into being for the purpose, and that being accomplished, is discarded. Just as, also, when men are the messengers, sometimes they speak the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in their own person, as when it is premised, <q>The Lord said,</q> or, <q>Thus says the Lord,</q>  or any other such phrase, but sometimes without any such prefix, they take upon themselves the very person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <em>e.g.</em>: <q>I will instruct you, and teach you in the way wherein you shall go:</q>  so, not only in word, but also in act, the signifying of the person of God is imposed upon the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, in order that he may bear that person in the ministering of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; just as he, for instance, bore that person who divided his garment into twelve parts, and gave ten of them to the servant of King Solomon, to the future king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.  Sometimes, also, a thing which was not a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in his own proper self, and which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> already among earthly things, was assumed in order to signify this; as Jacob, when he had seen the dream, upon waking up did with the stone, which when asleep he had under his head.  Sometimes a thing is made in the same kind, for the mere purpose; so as either to continue a little while in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, as that brazen serpent was able to do which was lifted up in the wilderness,  and as written records are able to do likewise; or so as to pass away after having accomplished its ministry, as the bread made for the purpose is consumed in the receiving of the sacrament.</p>

<p>20. But because these things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in that they are done by men, they may well meet with reverence as being <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, but they cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> wonder as being <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. And therefore those things which are done by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are the more wonderful to us, in that they are more difficult and more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; but they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and easy to them as being their own actions. An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> speaks in the person of God to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, saying, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob;</q> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> having said just before, <q>The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord appeared to him.</q>  And a man also speaks in the person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, <q>Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto you, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: I am the Lord your God.</q>  A rod was taken to serve as a sign, and was changed into a serpent by angelical power;  but although that power is wanting to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, yet a stone was taken also by man for a similar sign.  There is a wide difference between the deed of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and the deed of the man. The former is both to be wondered at and to be understood, the latter only to be understood. That which is understood from both, is perhaps one and the same; but those things from which it is understood, are different. Just as if the name of God were written both in gold and in ink; the former would be the more precious, the latter the more worthless; yet that which is signified in both is one and the same. And although the serpent that came from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> rod signified the same thing as Jacob's stone, yet Jacob's stone signified something better than did the serpents of the magicians. For as the anointing of the stone signified Christ in the flesh, in which He was anointed with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above His fellows;  so the rod of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, turned into a serpent, signified Christ Himself made <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> unto death, even the death of the cross.  Whence it is said, <q>And as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be lifted up, that whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life;</q>  just as by gazing on that serpent which was lifted up in the wilderness, they did not perish by the bites of the serpents. For <q>our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might be destroyed.</q>  For by the serpent death is understood, which was wrought by the serpent in paradise,  the mode of speech expressing the effect by the efficient. Therefore the rod passed into the serpent, Christ into death; and the serpent again into the rod, whole Christ with His body into the resurrection; which body is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>;  and this shall be in the end of time, signified by the tail, which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> held, in order that it might return into a rod.  But the serpents of the magicians, like those who are dead in the world, unless by believing in Christ they shall have been as it were swallowed up by,  and have entered into, His body, will not be able to rise again in Him. Jacob's stone, therefore, as I said, signified something better than did the serpents of the magicians; yet the deed of the magicians was much more wonderful. But these things in this way are no hindrance to the understanding of the matter; just as if the name of a man were written in gold, and that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in ink.</p>

<p>21. What man, again, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> made or took those clouds and fires in order to signify the message they were bearing, even if we supposed that the Lord or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was manifested in those corporeal forms? Just as infants do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of that which is placed upon the altar and consumed after the performance of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> celebration, whence or in what manner it is made, or whence it is taken for religious use. And if they were never to learn from their own experience or that of others, and never to see that species of thing except during the celebration of the sacrament, when it is being offered and given; and if it were told them by the most weighty authority whose body and blood it is; they will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> nothing else, except that the Lord absolutely appeared in this form to the eyes of mortals, and that that liquid actually flowed from the piercing of a side  which resembled this. But it is certainly a useful caution to myself, that I should remember what my own powers are, and admonish my brethren that they also remember what theirs are, lest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity pass on beyond what is safe. For how the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do these things, or rather, how God does these things by His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and how far He wills them to be done even by the bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, whether by permitting, or commanding, or compelling, from the hidden seat of His own supreme power; this I can neither penetrate by the sight of the eyes, nor make clear by assurance of reason, nor be carried on to comprehend it by reach of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, so as to speak thereupon to all questions that may be asked respecting these matters, as certainly as if I were an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, or an apostle. <q>For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devices are but uncertain. For the corruptible body presses down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the earthly tabernacle weighs down the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that muses upon many things. And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth, and with labor do we find the things that are before us; but the things that are in heaven, who has searched out?</q> But because it goes on to say, <q>And Your counsel who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, except Thou give wisdom, and send Your <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from above;</q>  therefore we refrain indeed from searching out the things which are in heaven, under which kind are contained both angelical bodies according to their proper dignity, and any corporeal action of those bodies; yet, according to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> sent to us from above, and to His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> imparted to our minds, I dare to say confidently, that neither <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor His Word, nor His Spirit, which is the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is in any way changeable in regard to that which He is, and whereby He is that which He is; and much less is in this regard visible. Since there are no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> some things changeable, yet not visible, as are our thoughts, and memories, and wills, and the whole incorporeal creature; but there is nothing that is visible that is not also changeable.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; The Essence of God Never Appeared in Itself. Divine Appearances to the Fathers Wrought by the Ministry of Angels. An Objection Drawn from the Mode of Speech Removed. That the Appearing of God to Abraham Himself, Just as that to Moses, Was Wrought by Angels. The Same Thing is Proved by the Law Being Given to Moses by Angels. What Has Been Said in This Book, and What Remains to Be Said in the Next.</h2>

<p>Wherefore the substance, or, if it is better so to say, the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  wherein we understand, in proportion to our measure, in however small a degree, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, since it is in no way changeable, can in no way in its proper self be visible.</p>

<p>22. It is manifest, accordingly, that all those appearances to the fathers, when God was presented to them according to His own dispensation, suitable to the times, were wrought through the creature. And if we cannot discern in what manner He wrought them by ministry of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, yet we say that they were wrought by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; but not from our own power of discernment, lest we should seem to any one to be wise beyond our measure, whereas we are wise so as to think soberly, as God has dealt to us the measure of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;  and we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and therefore speak.  For the authority is extant of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, from which our reason ought not to turn aside; nor by leaving the solid support of the divine utterance, to fall headlong over the precipice of its own surmisings, in matters wherein neither the perceptions of the body rule, nor the clear reason of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shines forth. Now, certainly, it is written most clearly in the Epistle to the Hebrews, when the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> was to be distinguished from the dispensation of the Old, according to the fitness of ages and of times, that not only those visible things, but also the word itself, was wrought by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For it is said thus: <q>But to which of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said He at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool? Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>?</q>  Whence it appears that all those things were not only wrought by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but wrought also on our account, that is, on account of the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom is promised the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. As it is written also to the Corinthians, <q>Now all these things happened unto them in a figure: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world have come.</q>  And then, demonstrating by plain consequence that as at that time the word was spoken by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, so now by the Son; <q>Therefore,</q> he says, <q>we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. For if the word spoken by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> recompense of reward; how shall we escape, if we neglect so great <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>?</q> And then, as though you asked, What <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>?&mdash; in order to show that he is now speaking of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, that is, of the word which was spoken not by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but by the Lord, he says, <q>Which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard Him; God also bearing them <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, both with signs and wonders, and with various <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and gifts of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, according to His own will.</q> </p>

<p>23. But some one may say, Why then is it written, <q>The Lord said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>;</q> and not, rather, The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? Because, when the crier proclaims the words of the judge, it is not usually written in the record, so and so the crier said, but so and so the judge. In like manner also, when the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> speaks, although we say, The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said, we mean nothing else to be understood than that the Lord said; and if we were to say, The Lord said, we should not put the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> aside, but only intimate who spoke by him. And, indeed, these Scriptures often reveal the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to be the Lord, of whose speaking it is from time to time said, <q>the Lord said,</q> as we have shown already. But on account of those who, since the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> in that place specifies an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, will have the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Himself and in Himself to be understood, because He is called an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, as announcing the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of His Father and of Himself; I have therefore thought fit to produce a plainer testimony from this epistle, where it is not said by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but <q>by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q></p>

<p>24. For Stephen, too, in the Acts of the Apostles, relates these things in that manner in which they are also written in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>: <q>Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken,</q> he says; <q>The God of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> appeared unto our father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, when he was in Mesopotamia.</q>  But lest any one should think that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> appeared then to the eyes of any mortal in that which He is in Himself, he goes on to say that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> appeared to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. <q>Then fled <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>,</q> he says, <q>at that saying, and was a stranger in the land of Midian, where he begot two sons. And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush. When <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying, I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of your fathers, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob. Then <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> trembled, and dared not behold. Then said the Lord to him, Put off your shoes from your feet,</q>  etc. Here, certainly, he speaks both of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and of Lord; and of the same as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob; as is written in Genesis.</p>

<p>25. Can there be any one who will say that the Lord appeared to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> by Himself? Let us not answer this question from Stephen, but from the book itself, whence Stephen took his narrative. For, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, because it is written, <q>And the Lord God said unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>;</q>  and a little after, <q>And the Lord God appeared unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>;</q>  were these things, for this reason, not done by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>? Whereas it is said in like manner in another place, <q>And the Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</q> and yet it is added immediately, <q>And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him:</q>  of whom we have already spoken. For how will these people, who either will not rise from the words to the meaning, or easily throw themselves down from the meaning to the words&mdash;how, I say, will they be able to explain that God was seen in three men, except they confess that they were <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as that which follows also shows? Because it is not said an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> spoke or appeared to him, will they therefore venture to say that the vision and voice granted to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was wrought by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> because it is so written, but that God appeared and spoke in His own substance to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> because there is no mention made of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>? What of the fact, that even in respect to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is not left unmentioned? For when his son was ordered to be offered up as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, we read thus: <q>And it came to pass after these things that God did tempt <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and said unto him, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: and he said, Behold, here I am. And He said, Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and go to the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains that I will tell you of.</q> Certainly God is here mentioned, not an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. But a little afterwards Scripture has it thus: <q>And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: and he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay not your hand upon the lad, neither do anything unto him.</q> What can be answered to this? Will they say that God commanded that Isaac should be slain, and that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> forbade it? And further, that the father himself, in opposition to the decree of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who had commanded that he should be slain, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, who had bidden him spare him? Such an interpretation is to be rejected as absurd. Yet not even for it, gross and abject as it is, does Scripture leave any room, for it immediately adds: <q>For now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, on account of me.</q>  What is <q>on account of me,</q> except on account of Him who had commanded him to be slain? Was then the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> the same as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, or was it not rather God by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>? Consider what follows. Here, certainly, already an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> has been most clearly spoken of; yet notice the context: <q>And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son. And <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> called the name of that place, The Lord saw:  as it is said to this day, In the mount the Lord was seen.</q>  Just as that which a little before God said by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, <q>For now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> not because it was to be understood that God then came to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but that He brought it to pass that through God <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> himself came to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what strength of heart he had to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even to the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> of his only son: after that mode of speech in which the effect is signified by the efficient&mdash;as cold is said to be sluggish, because it makes men sluggish; so that He was therefore said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, because He had made <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> himself to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, who might well have not discerned the firmness of his own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, had it not been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by such a trial. So here, too, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> called the name of the place <q>The Lord saw,</q> that is, caused Himself to be seen. For he goes on immediately to say, <q>As it is said to this day, In the mount the Lord was seen.</q> Here you see the same <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is called Lord: wherefore, unless because the Lord spoke by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>? But if we pass on to that which follows, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> altogether speaks as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and reveals expressly that God is speaking by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. <q>And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord,</q> he says, <q>called unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> out of heaven the second time, and said, By myself I have <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a>, says the Lord; for because you have done this thing, and hast not withheld your son, your only son, on account of me,</q>  etc. Certainly these words, <em>viz</em>. that he by whom the Lord speaks should say, <q>Thus says the Lord,</q> are commonly used by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> also. Does the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> say of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>The Lord says,</q> while He Himself is that Angel of the Father? What then? Do they not see how hard pressed they are about these three men who appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, when it had been said before, <q>The Lord appeared to him?</q> Were they not <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> because they are called men? Let them read Daniel, saying, <q>Behold the man Gabriel.</q> </p>

<p>26. But why do we delay any longer to stop their mouths by another most clear and most weighty <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, where not an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in the singular nor men in the plural are spoken of, but simply <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; by whom not any particular word was wrought, but the Law itself is most distinctly declared to be given; which certainly none of the faithful doubts that God gave to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> for the control of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, or yet, that it was given by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. So Stephen speaks: <q>You stiff-necked,</q> he says, <q>and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: as your fathers did, so do you. Which of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have not your fathers <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>? And they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers: who have received the Law by the disposition of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,  and have not kept it.</q>  What is more evident than this? What more strong than such an authority? The Law, indeed, was given to that people by the disposition of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; but the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> was by it prepared and pre-announced; and He Himself, as the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, was in some wonderful and unspeakable manner in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, by whose disposition the Law itself was given. And hence He said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>For had you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you would have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> me; for he wrote of me.</q>  Therefore then the Lord was speaking by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>, who was to be the Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men, from the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, was preparing His own advent by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, that He might find some by whom He would be received, confessing themselves guilty, whom the Law unfulfilled had made transgressors. And hence the apostle also says to the Galatians, <q>Wherefore then serves the Law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made, which [seed] was ordered  through <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the hand of a mediator;</q>  that is, ordered through <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in His <em>own</em> hand. For He was not born in limitation, but in power. But you learn in another place that he does not mean any one of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as a mediator, but the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself, in so far as He deigned to be made man: <q>For there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>,</q> he says, <q>and one Mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the man Christ Jesus.</q>  Hence that passover in the killing of the lamb:  hence all those things which are figuratively spoken in the Law, of Christ to come in the flesh, and to suffer, but also to rise again, which Law was given by the disposition of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; in which <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, were certainly the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and in which, sometimes the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, sometimes the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, sometimes the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and sometimes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without any distinction of person, was figuratively signified by them, although appearing in visible and sensible forms, yet by His own creature, not by His substance, in order to the seeing of which, hearts are cleansed through all those things which are seen by the eyes and heard by the ears.</p>

<p>27. But now, as I think, that which we had undertaken to show in this book has been sufficiently discussed and demonstrated, according to our capacity; and it has been established, both by probable reason, so far as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or rather, so far as I am able, and by strength of authority, so far as the divine declarations from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> have been made clear, that those words and bodily appearances which were given to these ancient fathers of ours before the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, when God was said to appear, were wrought by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: whether themselves speaking or doing something in the person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as we have shown that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> also were wont to do, or assuming from the creature that which they themselves were not, wherein God might be shown in a figure to men; which manner of showing also, Scripture teaches by many examples, that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, too, did not omit. It remains, therefore, now for us to consider&mdash;since both in the Lord as born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> descending in a corporeal form like a dove,  and in the tongues like as of fire, which appeared with a sound from heaven on the day of Pentecost, after the ascension of the Lord,  it was not the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> Himself by His own substance, in which He is equal and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor the Spirit of the Father and of the Son by His own substance, in which He Himself also is equal and co-eternal with both, but assuredly a creature, such as could be formed and exist in these fashions, which appeared to corporeal and mortal senses&mdash;it remains, I say, to consider what difference there is between these manifestations and those which were proper to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, although wrought by the visible creature;  which subject we shall more conveniently begin in another book.</p>
