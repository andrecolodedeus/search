<h1>On the Trinity (Book IV)</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">Explains for what the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was sent, viz, that by Christ's dying for sinners, we were to be convinced how great is God's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for us, and also what manner of men we are whom He loved. That the Word came in the flesh, to the purpose also of enabling us to be so cleansed as to contemplate and cleave to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. That our double death was abolished by His death, being one and single. And hereupon is discussed, how the single of our Saviour harmonizes to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> with our double; and the perfection is treated at length of the senary number, to which the ratio itself of single to double is reducible. That all are gathered together from many into one by the one Mediator of life, viz. Christ, through Whom alone is wrought the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> cleansing of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Further it is demonstrated that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, although made less by being sent, on account of the form of a servant which He took, is not therefore less than the Father according to the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He was sent by Himself: and that the same account is to be given of the sending of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</span> </p>

<h2>Preface.&mdash; The Knowledge of God is to Be Sought from God.</h2>

<p>1. The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things terrestrial and celestial is commonly thought much of by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Yet those doubtless judge better who prefer to that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of themselves; and that mind is more praiseworthy which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> even its own weakness, than that which, without regard to this, searches out, and even comes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, the ways of the stars, or which holds fast such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> already acquired, while <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the way by which itself to enter into its own proper health and strength. But if any one has already become awake towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, kindled by the warmth of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God has become vile in his own eyes; and through wishing, yet not having strength to come in unto Him, and through the light He gives, has given heed to himself, and has found himself, and has learned that his own filthiness cannot mingle with His purity; and feels it sweet to weep and to entreat Him, that again and again He will have compassion, until he have put off all his wretchedness; and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> confidently, as having already received of free gift the pledge of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through his only Saviour and Enlightener of man:&mdash; such an one, so acting, and so lamenting, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not puff up, because charity edifies;  for he has preferred <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he has preferred to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his own weakness, rather than to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the walls of the world, the foundations of the earth, and the pinnacles of heaven. And by obtaining this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he has obtained also sorrow;  but sorrow for straying away from the desire of reaching his own proper country, and the Creator of it, his own blessed God. And if among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> such as these, in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Your Christ, O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I groan among Your poor, give me out of Your bread to answer men who do not hunger and thirst after righteousness, but are sated and abound.  But it is the vain image of those things that has sated them, not Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which they have repelled and shrunk from, and so fall into their own vanity. I certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how many figments the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart gives birth to. And what is my own heart but a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart? But I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of my heart, that I may not vomit forth (<em>eructuem</em>) into these writings any of these figments for solid truths, but that there may pass into them only what the breath of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has breathed into me; cast out though I am from the sight of His eyes,  and striving from afar to return by the way which the divinity of His only-begotten Son has made by His humanity. And this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, changeable though I am, I so far drink in, as far as in it I see nothing changeable: neither in place and time, as is the case with bodies; nor in time alone, and in a certain sense place, as with the thoughts of our own spirits; nor in time alone, and not even in any semblance of place, as with some of the reasonings of our own minds. For the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby He is, has altogether nothing changeable, neither in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, nor in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, nor in will; since there <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; and there <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and there <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is loved, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is loved.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; We are Made Perfect by Acknowledgement of Our Own Weakness. The Incarnate Word Dispels Our Darkness.</h2>

<p>2. But since we are exiled from the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, yet neither cut off nor torn away from it so that we should not seek <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, blessedness, even in those changeable and temporal things (for we wish neither to die, nor to be deceived, nor to be troubled); visions have been sent to us from heaven suitable to our state of pilgrimage, in order to remind us that what we seek is not here, but that from this pilgrimage we must return there, whence unless we originated we should not here seek these things. And first we have had to be persuaded how much God loved us, lest from despair we should not dare to look up to Him. And we needed to be shown also what manner of men we are whom He loved, lest being <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, as if of our own merits, we should recede the more from Him, and fail the more in our own strength. And hence He so dealt with us, that we might the rather profit by His strength, and that so in the weakness of humility the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of charity might be perfected. And this is intimated in the Psalm, where it is said, <q>You, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sent a spontaneous rain, whereby You made Your inheritance perfect, when it was weary.</q>  For by <q>spontaneous rain</q> nothing else is meant than <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not rendered to merit, but given freely,  whence also it is called <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for He gave it, not because we were worthy, but because He willed. And <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this, we shall not trust in ourselves; and this is to be made <q>weak.</q> But He Himself makes us perfect, who says also to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, <q>My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for you, for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</q>  Man, then, was to be persuaded how much God loved us, and what manner of men we were whom He loved; the former, lest we should despair; the latter, lest we should be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>. And this most necessary topic the apostle thus explains: <q>But God commends,</q> he says, <q>His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> through Him. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note130445"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;5:8-10</a>&mdash; <em>Donavit</em></span> Also in another place: <q>What,</q> he says, <q>shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how has He not with Him also freely given us all things?</q>  Now that which is declared to us as already done, was shown also to the ancient righteous as about to be done; that through the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they themselves also might be humbled, and so made weak; and might be made weak, and so perfected.</p>

<p>3. Because therefore the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is One, by which all things were made, which is the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, all things are simultaneously therein, potentially and unchangeably; not only those things which are now in this whole creation, but also those which have been and those which shall be. And therein they neither have been, nor shall be, but only <em>are</em>; and all things are life, and all things are one; or rather it is one being and one life. For all things were so made by Him, that whatsoever was made in them was not made in Him, but was life in Him. Since, <q>in the beginning,</q> the Word was not made, but <q>the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and all things were made by Him;</q> neither had all things been made by Him, unless He had Himself been before all things and not made. But in those things which were made by Him, even body, which is not life, would not have been made by Him, except it had been life in Him before it was made. For <q>that which was made was already life in Him;</q> and not life of any kind soever: for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also is the life of the body, but this too is made, for it is changeable; and by what was it made, except by the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>? For <q>all things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made.</q> <q>What, therefore, was made was already life in Him;</q> and not any kind of life, but <q>the life [which] was the light of men;</q> the light certainly of rational minds, by which men differ from beasts, and therefore are men. Therefore not corporeal light, which is the light of the flesh, whether it shine from heaven, or whether it be lighted by earthly fires; nor that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh only, but also that of beasts, and down even to the minutest of worms. For all these things see that light: but that life was the light of men; nor is it far from any one of us, for in it <q>we live, and move, and have our being.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; How We are Rendered Apt for the Perception of Truth Through the Incarnate Word.</h2>

<p>4. But <q>the light shines in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.</q> Now the <q>darkness</q> is the foolish <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, made blind by vicious desires and unbelief. And that the Word, by whom all things were made, might care for these and heal them, <q>The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, and dwelt among us.</q> For our enlightening is the partaking of the Word, namely, of that life which is the light of men. But for this partaking we were utterly unfit, and fell short of it, on account of the uncleanness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore we were to be cleansed. And further, the one cleansing of the unrighteous and of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> is the blood of the Righteous One, and the humbling of God Himself;  that we might be cleansed through Him, made as He was what we are by nature, and what we are not by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that we might contemplate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which by nature we are not. For by nature we are not God: by nature we are men, by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> we are not righteous. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, made a righteous man, interceded with God for man the sinner. For the sinner is not congruous to the righteous, but man is congruous to man. By joining therefore to us the likeness of His humanity, He took away the unlikeness of our unrighteousness; and by being made partaker of our mortality, He made us partakers of His divinity. For the death of the sinner springing from the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of comdemnation is deservedly abolished by the death of the Righteous One springing from the free choice of His compassion, while His single [death and resurrection] answers to our double [death and resurrection].  For this congruity, or suitableness, or concord, or consonance, or whatever more appropriate word there may be, whereby one is [united] to two, is of great weight in all compacting, or better, perhaps, co-adaptation, of the creature. For (as it just occurs to me) what I mean is precisely that co-adaptation which the Greeks call <span class="greek">&#x1F01;&#x03C1;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span> . However this is not the place to set forth the power of that consonance of single to double which is found especially in us, and which is naturally so implanted in us (and by whom, except by Him who created us?), that not even the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> can fail to perceive it, whether when singing themselves or hearing others. For by this it is that treble and bass voices are in harmony, so that any one who in his note departs from it, offends extremely, not only trained skill, of which the most part of men are devoid, but the very sense of hearing. To demonstrate this, needs no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> a long discourse; but any one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it, may make it plain to the very ear in a rightly ordered monochord.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; The One Death and Resurrection of The Body of Christ Harmonizes with Our Double Death and Resurrection of Body and Soul, to the Effect of Salvation. In What Way the Single Death of Christ is Bestowed Upon Our Double Death.</h2>

<p>5. But for our present need we must discuss, so far as God gives us power, in what manner the single of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a> answers to, and is, so to say, in harmony with our double to the effect of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. We certainly, as no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doubts, are dead both in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body: in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; in body, because of the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and through this also in body because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And to both these parts of ourselves, that is, both to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and to body, there was need both of a medicine and of resurrection, that what had been changed for the worse might be renewed for the better. Now the death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is ungodliness, and the death of the body is corruptibility, through which comes also a departure of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body. For as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> dies when God leaves it, so the body dies when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> leaves it; whereby the former becomes foolish, the latter lifeless. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is raised up again by repentance, and the renewing of life is begun in the body still mortal by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by which men <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him who justifies  the ungodly;  and it is increased and strengthened by good habits from day to day, as the inner man is renewed more and more.  But the body, being as it were the outward man, the longer this life lasts is so much the more corrupted, either by age or by disease, or by various afflictions, until it come to that last affliction which all call death. And its resurrection is delayed until the end; when also our justification itself shall be perfected ineffably. For then we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.  But now, so long as the corruptible body presses down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,  and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life upon earth is all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>,  in His sight shall no man living be justified,  in comparison of the righteousness in which we shall be made equal with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which shall be revealed in us. But why mention more <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> respecting the difference between the death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the death of the body, when the Lord in one sentence of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> has made either death easily distinguishable by any one from the other, where He says, <q>Let the dead bury their dead</q>?  For burial was the fitting disposal of a dead body. But by those who were to bury it He meant those who were dead in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the impiety of unbelief, such, namely, as are awakened when it is said, <q>Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.</q>  And there is a death which the apostle denounces, saying of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, <q>But she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.</q>  Therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which was before ungodly and is now godly, is said to have come alive again from the dead and to live, on account of the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But the body is not only said to be about to die, on account of that departure of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which will be; but on account of the great infirmity of flesh and blood it is even said to be now dead, in a certain place in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, namely, where the apostle says, that <q>the body is dead because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but the spirit is life because of righteousness.</q>  Now this life is wrought by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <q>since the just shall live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q>  But what follows? <q>But if the spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit which dwells in you.</q> </p>

<p>6. Therefore on this double death of ours our Saviour bestowed His own single death; and to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> both our resurrections, He appointed beforehand and set forth in <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> and type His own one resurrection. For He was not a sinner or ungodly, that, as though dead in spirit, He should need to be renewed in the inner man, and to be recalled as it were to the life of righteousness by repentance; but being clothed in mortal flesh, and in that alone dying, in that alone rising again, in that alone did He answer to both for us; since in it was wrought a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> as regards the inner man, and a type as regards the outer. For it was in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> as regards our inner man, so as to signify the death of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that those words were uttered, not only in the Psalm, but also on the cross: <q>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have You forsaken me?</q>  To which words the apostle agrees, saying, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q> since by the crucifixion of the inner man are understood the pains of repentance, and a certain wholesome agony of self-control, by which death the death of ungodliness is destroyed, and in which death God has left us. And so the body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is destroyed through such a cross, that now we should not yield our members as instruments of unrighteousness unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.  Because, if even the inner man certainly is renewed day by day,  yet undoubtedly it is old before it is renewed. For that is done inwardly of which the same apostle speaks: <q>Put off the old man, and put on the new;</q> which he goes on to explain by saying, <q>Wherefore, putting away lying, speak every man <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>  But where is lying put away, unless inwardly, that he who speaks the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from his heart may inhabit the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hill of God?  But the resurrection of the body of the Lord is shown to belong to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our own inner resurrection, where, after He had risen, He says to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, <q>Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;</q>  with which <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> the apostle's words agree, where he says, <q>If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; set your thoughts  on things above.</q>  For not to touch Christ, unless when He had ascended to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, means not to have thoughts  of Christ after a fleshly manner. Again, the death of the flesh of our Lord contains a type of the death of our outer man, since it is by such suffering most of all that He exhorts His servants that they should not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.  Wherefore the apostle says, <q>That I may fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.</q>  And the resurrection of the body of the Lord is found to contain a type of the resurrection of our outward man, because He says to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>Handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.</q>  And one of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> also, handling His scars, exclaimed, <q>My Lord and my God!</q>  And whereas the entire integrity of that flesh was apparent, this was shown in that which He had said when exhorting His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: <q>There shall not a hair of your head perish.</q>  For how comes it that first is said, <q>Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;</q>  and how comes it that before He ascends to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He actually is touched by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: unless because in the former the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the inner man was intimated, in the latter a type was given of the outer man? Or can any one possibly be so without understanding, and so turned away from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as to dare to say that He was touched by men before He ascended, but by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> when He had ascended? It was on account of this type, which went before in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, of our future resurrection in the body, that the apostle says, <q>Christ the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>; afterward they that are Christ's.</q>  For it was the resurrection of the body to which this place refers, on account of which he also says, <q>Who has changed our vile body, that it may be fashioned like His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> body.</q>  The one death therefore of our Saviour brought <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to our double death, and His one resurrection wrought for us two resurrections; since His body in both cases, that is, both in His death and in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, was ministered to us by a kind of healing suitableness, both as a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the inner man, and as a type of the outer.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; The Ratio of the Single to the Double Comes from the Perfection of the Senary Number. The Perfection of The Senary Number is Commended in the Scriptures. The Year Abounds in The Senary Number.</h2>

<p>7. Now this ratio of the single to the double arises, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, from the ternary number, since one added to two makes three; but the whole which these make reaches to the senary, for one and two and three make six. And this number is on that account called perfect, because it is completed in its own parts: for it has these three, sixth, third, and half; nor is there any other part found in it, which we can call an aliquot part. The sixth part of it, then, is one; the third part, two; the half, three. But one and two and three complete the same six. And <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> commends to us the perfection of this number, especially in this, that God finished His works in six days, and on the sixth day man was made in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  And the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> came and was made the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, that He might re-create us after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the sixth age of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. For that is now the present age, whether a thousand years apiece are assigned to each age, or whether we trace out memorable and remarkable epochs or turning-points of time in the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, so that the first age is to be found from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> until <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, and the second thence onwards to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and then next, after the division of Matthew the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to David, from David to the carrying away to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and from thence to the travail of the Virgin,  which three ages joined to those other two make five. Accordingly, the nativity of the Lord began the sixth, which is now going onwards until the hidden end of time. We recognize also in this senary number a kind of figure of time, in that threefold mode of division, by which we compute one portion of time before the Law; a second, under the Law; a third, under <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. In which last time we have received the sacrament of renewal, that we may be renewed also in the end of time, in every part, by the resurrection of the flesh, and so may be made whole from our entire infirmity, not only of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but also of body. And thence that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is understood to be a type of the church, who was made whole and upright by the Lord, after she had been bowed by infirmity through the binding of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. For those words of the Psalm lament such hidden enemies: <q>They bowed down my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q>  And this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> had her infirmity eighteen years, which is thrice six. And the months of eighteen years are found in number to be the cube of six, <em>viz</em>. six times six times six. Nearly, too, in the same place in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is that fig tree, which was convicted also by the third year of its miserable barrenness. But intercession was made for it, that it might be let alone that year, that year, that if it bore fruit, well; if otherwise, it should be cut down.  For both three years belong to the same threefold division, and the months of three years make the square of six, which is six times six.</p>

<p>8. A single year also, if the whole twelve months are taken into account, which are made up of thirty days each (for the month that has been kept from of old is that which the revolution of the moon determines), abounds in the number six. For that which six is, in the first order of numbers, which consists of units up to ten, that sixty is in the second order, which consists of tens up to a hundred. Sixty days, then, are a sixth part of the year. Further, if that which stands as the sixth of the second order is multiplied by the sixth of the first order, then we make six times sixty, <em>i.e.</em> three hundred and sixty days, which are the whole twelve months. But since, as the revolution of the moon determines the month for men, so the year is marked by the revolution of the sun; and five days and a quarter of a day remain, that the sun may fulfill its course and end the year; for four quarters make one day, which must be intercalated in every fourth year, which they call bissextile, that the order of time may not be disturbed: if we consider, also, these five days and a quarter themselves, the number six prevails in them. First, because, as it is usual to compute the whole from a part, we must not call it five days, but rather six, taking the quarter days for one day. Next, because five days themselves are the sixth part of a month; while the quarter of a day contains six hours. For the entire day, <em>i.e.</em> including its night, is twenty-four hours, of which the fourth part, which is a quarter of a day, is found to be six hours. So much in the course of the year does the sixth number prevail.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; The Number Six is Also Commended in the Building Up of the Body of Christ and of the Temple at Jerusalem.</h2>

<p>9. And not without reason is the number six understood to be put for a year in the building up of the body of the Lord, as a figure of which He said that He would raise up in three days the temple destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For they said, <q>Forty and six years was this temple in building.</q>  And six times forty-six makes two hundred and seventy-six. And this number of days completes nine months and six days, which are reckoned, as it were, ten months for the travail of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; not because all come to the sixth day after the ninth month, but because the perfection itself of the body of the Lord is found to have been brought in so many days to the birth, as the authority of the church maintains upon the tradition of the elders. For He is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have been conceived on the 25th of March, upon which day also He suffered; so the womb of the Virgin, in which He was conceived, where no one of mortals was begotten, corresponds to the new grave in which He was buried, wherein was never man laid,  neither before nor since. But He was born, according to tradition, upon December the 25th. If, then you reckon from that day to this you find two hundred and seventy-six days which is forty-six times six. And in this number of years the temple was built, because in that number of sixes the body of the Lord was perfected; which being destroyed by the suffering of death, He raised again on the third day. For <q>He spoke this of the temple of His body,</q>  as is declared by the most clear and solid testimony of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; where He said, <q>For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so shall the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; The Three Days of the Resurrection, in Which Also the Ratio of Single to Double is Apparent.</h2>

<p>10. Scripture again witnesses that the space of those three days themselves was not whole and entire, but the first day is counted as a whole from its last part, and the third day is itself also counted as a whole from its first part; but the intervening day, <em>i.e.</em> the second day, was absolutely a whole with its twenty-four hours, twelve of the day and twelve of the night. For He was crucified first by the voices of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>, when it was the sixth day of the week. Then He hung on the cross itself at the sixth hour, and yielded up His spirit at the ninth hour.  But He was buried, <q>now when the evening had come,</q> as the words of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> express it;  which means, at the end of the day. Wheresoever then you begin&mdash;even if some other explanation can be given, so as not to contradict the <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">Gospel of John</a>,  but to understand that He was suspended on the cross at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>&mdash;still you cannot make the first day an entire day. It will be reckoned then an entire day from its last part, as the third from its first part. For the night up to the dawn, when the resurrection of the Lord was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, belongs to the third day; because God (who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,  that through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and the partaking of the resurrection of Christ the words might be spoken to us <q>For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord</q> ) intimates to us in some way that the day takes its beginning from the night. For as the first days of all were reckoned from light to night, on account of the future fall of man;  so these on account of the restoration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, are reckoned from darkness to light. From the hour, then, of His death to the dawn of the resurrection are forty hours, counting in also the ninth hour itself. And with this number agrees also His life upon earth of forty days after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. And this number is most frequently used in Scripture to express the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of perfection in the fourfold world. For the number ten has a certain perfection, and that multiplied by four makes forty. But from the evening of the burial to the dawn of the resurrection are thirty-six hours which is six squared. And this is referred to that ratio of the single to the double wherein there is the greatest consonance of co-adaptation. For twelve added to twenty-four suits the ratio of single added to double and makes thirty-six: namely a whole night with a whole day and a whole night, and this not without the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which I have noticed above. For not unfitly do we liken the spirit to the day and the body to the night. For the body of the Lord in His death and resurrection was a figure of our spirit and a type of our body. In this way, then, also that ratio of the single to the double is apparent in the thirty-six hours, when twelve are added to twenty-four. As to the reasons, indeed, why these numbers are so put in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, other people may trace out other reasons, either such that those which I have given are to be preferred to them, or such as are equally probable with mine, or even more probable than they are; but there is no one surely so foolish or so absurd as to contend that they are so put in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> for no purpose at all, and that there are no mystical reasons why those numbers are there mentioned. But those reasons which I have here given, I have either gathered from the authority of the church, according to the tradition of our forefathers, or from the testimony of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, or from the nature itself of numbers and of similitudes. No sober person will decide against reason, no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> against the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, no peaceable person against the church.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; In What Manner We are Gathered from Many into One Through One Mediator.</h2>

<p>11. This <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, this <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, this <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before He was sent and came, being made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>&mdash; of Him, all those things which appeared to our fathers in a sacred and mystical way by angelical <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, or which were done by the fathers themselves, were similitudes; in order that every creature by its acts might speak in some way of that One who was to be, in whom there was to be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in the recovery of all from death. For because by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of ungodliness we had recoiled and fallen away in discord from the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and had in many things become vain, being distracted through many things and cleaving fast to many things; it was needful, by the decree and command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His mercy, that those same many things should join in proclaiming the One that should come, and that One should come so proclaimed by these many things, and that these many things should join in witnessing that this One had come; and that so, freed from the burden of these many things, we should come to that One, and dead as we were in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and destined to die in the flesh on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that we should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that One who, without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, died in the flesh for us; and by believing in Him now raised again, and by rising again with Him in the spirit through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that we should be justified by being made one in the one righteous One; and that we should not despair of our own resurrection in the flesh itself, when we consider that the one Head had gone before us the many members; in whom, being now cleansed through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and then renewed by sight, and through Him as mediator reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we are to cleave to the One, to feast upon the One, to continue one.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; In What Manner Christ Wills that All Shall Be One in Himself.</h2>

<p>12. So the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Himself, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, Himself also the Mediator between God and men, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>,  equal to the Father through the unity of the Godhead, and partaker with us by the taking upon Him of humanity, interceding for us with the Father in that He was man,  yet not concealing that He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, among other things speaks thus: <q>Neither <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> I for these alone,</q> He says, <q>but for them also which shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me through their word; that they all may be one; as You, Father, art in me, and I in You, that they also may be one in us: that the world may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that You have sent me. And the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which You gave me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; The Same Argument Continued.</h2>

<p>He did not say, I and they are one thing;  although, in that He is the head of the church which is His body,  He might have said, and they are, not one thing,  but one person,  because the head and the body is one Christ; but in order to show His own Godhead consubstantial with the Father (for which reason He says in another place, <q>I and my Father are one</q> ), in His own kind, that is, in the consubstantial parity of the same nature, He wills His own to be one,  but in Himself; since they could not be so in themselves, separated as they are one from another by various pleasures and desires and uncleannesses of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; whence they are cleansed through the Mediator, that they may be one  in Him, not only through the same nature in which all become from mortal men equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but also through the same will most harmoniously conspiring to the same blessedness, and fused in some way by the fire of charity into one spirit. For to this His words come, <q>That they may be one, even as we are one;</q> namely, that as the Father and Son are one, not only in equality of substance, but also in will, so those also may be one, between whom and God the Son is mediator, not only in that they are of the same nature, but also through the same union of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And then He goes on thus to intimate the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, that He is the Mediator, through whom we are reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by saying, <q>I in them, and You in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; As Christ is the Mediator of Life, So the Devil is the Mediator of Death.</h2>

<p>13. Therein is our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> peace and firm bond of union with our Creator, that we should be purified and reconciled through the Mediator of life, as we had been polluted and alienated, and so had departed from Him, through the mediator of death. For as the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> led man through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to death; so Christ through lowliness led back man through <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to life. Since, as the one fell through being lifted up, and cast down [man] also who consented to him; so the other was raised up through being abased, and lifted up [man] also who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him. For because the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> had not himself come there whither he had led the way (inasmuch as he bare indeed in his ungodliness the death of the spirit, but had not undergone the death of the flesh, because he had not assumed the covering of the flesh), he appeared to man to be a mighty chief among the legions of devils, through whom he exercises his reign of deceits; so puffing up man the more, who is eager for power more than righteousness, through the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of elation, or through false <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; or else entangling him through <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, in which, while casting down headlong by deceit and illusion the minds of the more curious and prouder sort, he holds him captive also to magical trickery; promising too the cleansing of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, through those initiations which they call <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;</span>, by transforming himself into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light,  through various machinations in signs and prodigies of lying.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; Miracles Which are Done by Demons are to Be Spurned.</h2>

<p>14. For it is easy for the most worthless spirits to do many things by means of aerial bodies, such as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> wonder to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which are weighed down by earthly bodies, even though they be of the better inclined. For if earthly bodies themselves, when trained by a certain skill and practice, exhibit to men so great marvels in theatrical spectacles, that they who never saw such things scarcely <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them when told; why should it be hard for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to make out of corporeal elements, through their own aerial bodies, things at which the flesh marvels; or even by hidden inspirations to contrive fantastic appearances to the deluding of men's senses, whereby to deceive them, whether awake or asleep, or to drive them into frenzy? But just as it may happen that one who is better than they in life and character may gaze at the most worthless of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, either walking on a rope, or doing by various motions of the body many things difficult of belief, and yet he may not at all desire to do such things, nor think those men on that account to be preferred to himself; so the faithful and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not only if it sees, but even if on account of the frailty of the flesh it shudders at, the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; yet will not for that either deplore its own want of power to do such things, or judge them on this account to be better than itself; especially since it is in the company of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, who, whether they are men or good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, accomplish, through the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom all things are subject, wonders which are far greater and the very reverse of deceptive.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; The Devil the Mediator of Death, Christ of Life.</h2>

<p>15. In no wise therefore are <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> cleansed and reconciled to God by <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> imitations, or curious arts that are impious, or magical incantations; since the false mediator does not translate them to higher things, but rather blocks and cuts off the way there through the affections, malignant in proportion as they are <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, which he inspires into those of his own company; which are not able to nourish the wings of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> so as to fly upwards, but rather to heap up the weight of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> so as to press downwards; since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will fall down the more heavily, the more it seems to itself to have been carried upwards. Accordingly, as the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> did when warned of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  whom the star led to adore the low estate of the Lord; so we also ought to return to our country, not by the way by which we came, but by another way which the lowly King has taught, and which the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> king, the adversary of that lowly King, cannot block up. For to us, too, that we may adore the lowly Christ, the <q>heavens have declared the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when their sound went into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.</q>  A way was made for us to death through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in Adam. For, <q>By one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in whom all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q>  Of this way the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was the mediator, the persuader to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the caster down into death. For he, too, applied his one death to work out our double death. Since he indeed died in the spirit through ungodliness, but certainly did not die in the flesh: yet both persuaded us to ungodliness, and thereby brought it to pass that we deserved to come into the death of the flesh. We desired therefore the one through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> persuasion, the other followed us by a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> condemnation; and therefore it is written, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made not death,</q>  since He was not Himself the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of death; but yet death was inflicted on the sinner, through His most just retribution. Just as the judge inflicts punishment on the guilty; yet it is not the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the judge, but the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of the crime, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the punishment. Whither, then, the mediator of death caused us to pass, yet did not come himself, that is, to the death of the flesh, there our Lord God introduced for us the medicine of correction, which He deserved not, by a hidden and exceeding <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> decree of divine and profound <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. In order, therefore, that as by one man came death, so by one man might come also the resurrection of the dead;  because men strove more to shun that which they could not shun, <em>viz.</em> the death of the flesh, than the death of the spirit, <em>i.e.</em> punishment more than the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of punishment (for not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a thing about which either men are not solicitous or are too little solicitous; but not to die, although it be not within reach of attainment, is yet eagerly sought after); the Mediator of life, making it plain that death is not to be feared, which by the condition of humanity cannot now be escaped, but rather ungodliness, which can be guarded against through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, meets us at the end to which we have come, but not by the way by which we came. For we, indeed, came to death through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; He through righteousness: and, therefore, as our death is the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so His death was made a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; The Death of Christ Voluntary. How the Mediator of Life Subdued the Mediator of Death. How the Devil Leads His Own to Despise the Death of Christ.</h2>

<p>16. Wherefore, since the spirit is to be preferred to the body, and the death of the spirit means that God has left it, but the death of the body that the spirit has left it; and since herein lies the punishment in the death of the body, that the spirit leaves the body against its will, because it left God willingly; so that, whereas the spirit left God because it would, it leaves the body although it would not; nor leaves it when it would, unless it has offered <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to itself, whereby the body itself is slain: the spirit of the Mediator showed how it was through no punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that He came to the death of the flesh, because He did not leave it against His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but because He willed, when He willed, as He willed. For because He is so commingled [with the flesh] by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> as to be one, He says: <q>I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again. No man takes it from me, but I lay down my life that I might take it again.</q>  And, as the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> tells us, they who were present were most astonished at this, that after that [last] word, in which He set forth the figure of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He immediately gave up His spirit. For they who are hung on the cross are commonly tortured by a prolonged death. Whence it was that the legs of the thieves were broken, in order that they might die directly, and be taken down from the cross before the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. And that He was found to be dead already, caused wonder. And it was this also, at which, as we read, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> marvelled, when the body of the Lord was asked of him for burial. </p>

<p>17. Because that deceiver then&mdash;who was a mediator to death for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and feignedly puts himself forward as to life, under the name of cleansing by <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> are led away&mdash;can neither share in our death, nor rise again from his own: he has indeed been able to apply his single death to our double one; but he certainly has not been able to apply a single resurrection, which should be at once a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our renewal, and a type of that waking up which is to be in the end. He then who being alive in the spirit raised again His own flesh that was dead, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Mediator of life, has cast out him, who is dead in the spirit and the mediator of death, from the spirits of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Himself, so that he should not reign within, but should assault from without, and yet not prevail. And to him, too, He offered Himself to be tempted, in order that He might be also a mediator to overcome his <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, not only by succor, but also by example. But when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, from the first, although striving through every entrance to creep into His inward parts, was thrust out, having finished all his alluring <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> in the wilderness after the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>;  because, being dead in the spirit, he forced no entrance into Him who was alive in the spirit, he betook himself, through eagerness for the death of man in any way whatsoever, to effecting that death which he could, and was permitted to effect it upon that mortal element which the living Mediator had received from us. And where he could do anything, there in every respect he was conquered; and wherein he received outwardly the power of slaying the Lord in the flesh, therein his inward power, by which he held ourselves, was slain. For it was brought to pass that the bonds of many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in many deaths were loosed, through the one death of One which no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had preceded. Which death, though not due, the Lord therefore rendered for us, that the death which was due might work us no hurt. For He was not stripped of the flesh by obligation of any authority, but He stripped Himself. For doubtless He who was able not to die, if He would not, did die because He would: and so He made a show of principalities and powers, openly triumphing over them in Himself.  For whereas by His death the one and most real <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> was offered up for us, whatever fault there was, whence principalities and powers held us fast as of right to pay its penalty, He cleansed, abolished, extinguished; and by His own resurrection He also called us whom He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to a new life; and whom He called, them He justified; and whom He justified, them He <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.  And so the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, in that very death of the flesh, lost man, whom he was possessing as by an absolute right, seduced as he was by his own consent, and over whom he ruled, himself impeded by no corruption of flesh and blood, through that frailty of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> mortal body, whence he was both too poor and too weak; he who was <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> in proportion as he was, as it were, both richer and stronger, ruling over him who was, as it were, both clothed in rags and full of troubles. For whither he drove the sinner to fall, himself not following, there by following he compelled the Redeemer to descend. And so the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> deigned to become our friend in the fellowship of death, to which because he came not, the enemy thought himself to be better and greater than ourselves. For our Redeemer says, <q>Greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</q>  Wherefore also the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> thought himself superior to the Lord Himself, inasmuch as the Lord in His sufferings yielded to him; for of Him, too, is understood what is read in the Psalm, <q>For You have made Him a little lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>:</q>  so that He, being Himself <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, although innocent, by the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> one acting against us as it were by just right, might by a most just right overcome him, and so might lead captive the captivity wrought through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,  and free us from a captivity that was just on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by blotting out the handwriting, and redeeming us who were to be justified although sinners, through His own righteous blood unrighteously poured out.</p>

<p>18. Hence also the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> mocks those who are his own until this very day, to whom he presents himself as a false mediator, as though they would be cleansed or rather entangled and drowned by his <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, in that he very easily persuades the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> to ridicule and despise the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, from which the more he himself is estranged, the more is he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by them to be the holier and more divine. Yet those who have remained with him are very few, since the nations acknowledge and with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> humility imbibe the price paid for themselves, and in trust upon it abandon their enemy, and gather together to their Redeemer. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how the most excellent wisdom of God makes use of both his snares and his fury to bring about the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of His own faithful ones, beginning from the former end, which is the beginning of the spiritual creature, even to the latter end, which is the death of the body, and so <q>reaching from the one end to the other, mightily and sweetly ordering all things.</q>  For wisdom <q>passes and goes through all things by reason of her pureness, and no defiled thing can fall into her.</q>  And since the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has nothing to do with the death of the flesh, whence comes his exceeding <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, a death of another kind is prepared in the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, by which not only the spirits that have earthly, but also those who have aerial bodies, can be tormented. But <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> men, by whom Christ is despised, because He died, wherein He bought us with so great a price,  both bring back the former death, and also men, to that miserable condition of nature, which is derived from the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and will be cast down into the latter death with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. And they on this account preferred the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because the former cast them into that former death, whither he himself fell not through the difference of his nature, and whither on account of them Christ descended through His great mercy: and yet they do not hesitate to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> themselves better than the devils, and do not cease to assail and denounce them with every sort of malediction, while they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them at any rate to have nothing to do with the suffering of this kind of death, on account of which they despise Christ. Neither will they take into account that the case may possibly be, that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, remaining in Himself, and in Himself in no way changeable, may yet, through the taking upon Him of a lower nature, be able to suffer somewhat of a lower kind, which the unclean spirit cannot suffer, because he has not an earthly body. And so, whereas they themselves are better than the devils, yet, because they bear a body of flesh, they can so die, as the devils certainly cannot die, who do not bear such a body. They presume much on the deaths of their own <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, which they do not perceive that they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to deceitful and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> spirits; or if they have come to perceive it, think their friendship to be of some good to themselves, treacherous and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> although they are, whose purpose is bent upon nothing else except to hinder our return.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; Christ the Most Perfect Victim for Cleansing Our Faults. In Every Sacrifice Four Things are to Be Considered.</h2>

<p>19. They do not understand, that not even the proudest of spirits themselves could <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, unless a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> was due to the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whose stead they desire to be worshipped: and that this cannot be rightly offered except by a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and righteous <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; nor unless that which is offered be received from those for whom it is offered; and unless also it be without fault, so that it may be offered for cleansing the faulty. This at least all desire who wish <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to be offered for themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Who then is so righteous and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> as the only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who had no need to purge His own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>,  neither original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, nor those which are added by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life? And what could be so fitly chosen by men to be offered for them as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh? And what so fit for this immolation as mortal flesh? And what so clean for cleansing the faults of mortal men as the flesh born in and from the womb of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, without any infection of carnal concupiscence? And what could be so acceptably offered and taken, as the flesh of our <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, made the body of our <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>? In such wise that, whereas four things are to be considered in every <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>&mdash;to whom it is offered, by whom it is offered, what is offered, for whom it is offered,&mdash; the same One and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Mediator Himself, reconciling us to God by the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of peace, might remain one with Him to whom He offered, might make those one in Himself for whom He offered, Himself might be in one both the offerer and the offering.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; They are Proud Who Think They are Able, by Their Own Righteousness, to Be Cleansed So as to See God.</h2>

<p>20. There are, however, some who think themselves capable of being cleansed by their own righteousness, so as to contemplate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to dwell in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whom their very <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> itself stains above all others. For there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to which the divine law is more opposed, and over which that proudest of spirits, who is a mediator to things below, but a barrier against things above, receives a greater right of mastery: unless either his secret snares be avoided by going another way, or if he rage openly by means of a sinful people (which Amalek, being interpreted, means), and forbid by fighting the passage to the land of promise, he be overcome by the cross of the Lord, which is prefigured by the holding out of the hands of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.  For these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> promise themselves cleansing by their own righteousness for this reason, because some of them have been able to penetrate with the eye of the mind beyond the whole creature, and to touch, though it be in ever so small a part, the light of the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; a thing which they deride many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> for being not yet able to do, who, in the meantime, live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone. But of what use is it for the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> man, who on that account is ashamed to embark upon the ship of wood,  to behold from afar his country beyond the sea? Or how can it hurt the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> man not to behold it from so great a distance, when he is actually coming to it by that wood upon which the other disdains to be borne?</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; The Old Philosophers are Not to Be Consulted Concerning the Resurrection and Concerning Things to Come.</h2>

<p>21. These people also blame us for believing the resurrection of the flesh, and rather wish us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> themselves concerning these things. As though, because they have been able to understand the high and unchangeable substance by the things which are made,  for this reason they had a claim to be consulted concerning the revolutions of mutable things, or concerning the connected order of the ages. For <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, because they dispute most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, and persuade us by most certain <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, that all things temporal are made after a science that is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, are they therefore able to see clearly in the matter of this science itself, or to collect from it, how many kinds of animals there are, what are the seeds of each in their beginnings, what measure in their increase, what numbers run through their conceptions, births, ages, settings; what motions in desiring things according to their nature, and in avoiding the contrary? Have they not sought out all these things, not through that unchangeable wisdom, but through the actual history of places and times, or have trusted the written experience of others? Wherefore it is the less to be wondered at, that they have utterly failed in searching out the succession of more lengthened ages, and in finding any goal of that course, down which, as though down a river, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is sailing, and the transition thence of each to its own appropriate end. For these are subjects which historians could not describe, inasmuch as they are far in the future, and have been experienced and related by no one. Nor have those <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who have profiled better than others in that high and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> science, been able to grasp such subjects with the understanding; otherwise they would not be inquiring as they could into past things of the kind, such as are in the province of historians, but rather would foreknow also things future; and those who are able to do this are called by them soothsayers, but by us <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>:</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.&mdash; In How Many Ways Things Future are Foreknown. Neither Philosophers, Nor Those Who Were Distinguished Among the Ancients, are to Be Consulted Concerning the Resurrection of the Dead.</h2>

<p>22.&mdash; although the name of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, too, is not altogether foreign to their writings. But it makes the greatest possible difference, whether things future are conjectured by experience of things past (as physicians also have committed many things to writing in the way of foresight, which they themselves have noted by experience; or as again husbandmen, or sailors, too, foretell many things; for if such predictions are made a long while before, they are thought to be divinations), or whether such things have already started on their road to come to us, and being seen coming far off, are announced in proportion to the acuteness of the sense of those who see them, by doing which the aerial powers are thought to divine (just as if a person from the top of a mountain were to see far off some one coming, and were to announce it beforehand to those who dwelt close by in the plain); or whether they are either fore-announced to certain men, or are heard by them and again transmitted to other men, by means of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, to whom God shows those things by His Word and His Wisdom, wherein both things future and things past consist: or whether the minds of certain men themselves are so far borne upwards by theHoly Spirit, as to behold, not through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but of themselves, the immoveable causes of things future, in that very highest pinnacle of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> itself. [And I say, behold,] for the aerial powers, too, <em>hear</em> these things, either by message through <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or through men; and hear only so much as He judges to be fitting, to whom all things are subject. Many things, too, are foretold by a kind of instinct and inward impulse of such as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them not: as <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he said, but being the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, he prophesied. </p>

<p>23. Therefore, neither concerning the successions of ages, nor concerning the resurrection of the dead, ought we to consult those <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who have understood as much as they could the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the Creator, in whom <q>we live, and move, and have our being.</q>  Since, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> God through those things which are made, they have not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither were thankful but professing themselves wise, they became fools.  And whereas they were not fit to fix the eye of the mind so firmly upon the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the spiritual and unchangeable nature, as to be able to see, in the wisdom itself of the Creator and Governor of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, those revolutions of the ages, which in that wisdom were already and were always, but here were about to be so that as yet they were not; or, again, to see therein those changes for the better, not of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> only, but also of the bodies of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, even to the perfection of their proper measure; whereas then, I say, they were in no way fit to see these things therein, they were not even judged worthy of receiving any announcement of them by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; whether externally through the senses of the body, or by interior revelations exhibited in the spirit; as these things actually were manifested to our fathers, who were gifted with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and who by foretelling them, obtaining credence either by present signs, or by events close at hand, which turned out as they had foretold, earned authority to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> respecting things remotely future, even to the end of the world. But the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and deceitful powers of the air, even if they are found to have said through their soothsayers some things of the fellowship and citizenship of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Mediator, which they heard from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> or the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, did so with the purpose of seducing even the faithful ones of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if they could, by these alien truths, to revolt to their own proper falsehoods. But God did this by those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what they said, in order that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> might sound abroad from all sides, to aid the faithful, to be a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against the ungodly.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; The Son of God Became Incarnate in Order that We Being Cleansed by Faith May Be Raised to the Unchangeable Truth.</h2>

<p>24. Since, then, we were not fit to take hold of things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and since the foulness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> weighed us down, which we had contracted by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of temporal things, and which were implanted in us as it were naturally, from the root of mortality, it was needful that we should be cleansed. But cleansed we could not be, so as to be tempered together with things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, except it were through things temporal, wherewith we were already tempered together and held fast. For health is at the opposite extreme from disease; but the intermediate process of healing does not lead us to perfect health, unless it has some congruity with the disease. Things temporal that are useless merely deceive the sick; things temporal that are useful take up those that need healing, and pass them on healed, to things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. And the rational <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as when cleansed it owes <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> to things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; so, when needing cleansing, owes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to things temporal. One even of those who were formerly esteemed wise men among the Greeks has said, The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> stands to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the same relation in which <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> stands to that which has a beginning. And he is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> right in saying so. For what we call temporal, he describes as having had a beginning. And we also ourselves come under this kind, not only in respect to the body, but also in respect to the changeableness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For that is not properly called <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> which undergoes any degree of change. Therefore, in so far as we are changeable, in so far we stand apart from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. But life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> is promised to us through the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, from the clear <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which, again, our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> stands as far apart as mortality does from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. We then now put <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in things done in time on our account, and by that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself we are cleansed; in order that when we have come to sight, as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> follows <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> may follow upon mortality. And therefore, since our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will become <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when we have attained to that which is promised to us who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: and that which is promised us is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; and the Truth (not that which shall come to be according as our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall be, but that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is always, because in it is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>&mdash;the Truth then) has said, <q>And this is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom You have sent:</q>  when our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by seeing shall come to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, then <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> shall possess our now changed mortality. And until this shall take place, and in order that it may take place&mdash;because we adapt the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of belief to things which have a beginning, as in things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> we hope for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, lest the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of mortal life should be at discord with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life&mdash;the Truth itself, co-eternal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, took a beginning from earth,  when the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> so came as to become the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, and to take to Himself our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that He might thereby lead us on to His own <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, who so undertook our mortality, as not to lose His own <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> stands to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the relation in which <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> stands to that which has a beginning. Therefore, we must needs so be cleansed, that we may come to have such a beginning as remains <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that we may not have one beginning in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and another in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Neither could we pass to things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> from the condition of having a beginning, unless we were transferred, by union of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> to ourselves through our own beginning, to His own <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Therefore our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has, in some measure, now followed there, whither He in whom we have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> has ascended; born,  dead, risen again, taken up. Of these four things, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the first two in ourselves. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that men both have a beginning and die. But the remaining two, that is, to be raised, and to be taken up, we rightly hope will be in us, because we have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> them done in Him. Since, therefore, in Him that, too, which had a beginning has passed over to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, in ourselves also it will so pass over, when <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall have arrived at <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For to those who thus <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, in order that they might remain in the word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and being thence led on to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and through that to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, might be freed from death, He speaks thus: <q>If you continue in my word, then are you my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> indeed.</q> And as though they would ask, With what fruit? He proceeds to say, <q>And you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> And again, as though they would say, Of what good is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to mortal men? <q>And the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> He says, <q>shall make you free.</q>  From what, except from death, from corruptions, from changeableness? Since <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> remains <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, incorrupt, unchangeable. But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> incorruptibility, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> unchangeableness, is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> itself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; In What Manner the Son Was Sent and Proclaimed Beforehand. How in the Sending of His Birth in the Flesh He Was Made Less Without Detriment to His Equality with the Father.</h2>

<p>25. Behold, then, why the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was sent; nay, rather behold what it is for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to be sent. Whatever things they were which were wrought in time, with a view to produce <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereby we might be cleansed so as to contemplate <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in things that have a beginning, which have been put forth from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and are referred back to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>: these were either testimonies of this mission, or they were the mission itself of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But some of these testimonies announced Him beforehand as to come, some testified that He had come already. For that He was made a creature by whom the whole creation was made, must needs find a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in the whole creation. For except one were preached by the sending of many [witnesses] one would not be bound to, the sending away of many. And unless there were such testimonies as should seem to be great to those who are lowly, it would not be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, that He being great should make men great, who as lowly was sent to the lowly. For the heaven and the earth and all things in them are incomparably greater works of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, since all things were made by Him, than the signs and the portents which broke forth in testimony of Him. But yet men, in order that, being lowly, they might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> these great things to have been wrought by Him, trembled at those lowly things, as if they had been great.</p>

<p>26. <q>When, therefore, the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the Law;</q>  to such a degree lowly, that He was <q>made;</q> in this way therefore sent, in that He was made. If, therefore, the greater sends the less, we too, acknowledge Him to have been made less; and in so far less, in so far as made; and in so far made, in so far as sent. For <q>He sent forth His Son made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q> And yet, because all things were made by Him, not only before He was made and sent, but before all things were at all, we confess the same to be equal to the sender, whom we call less, as having been sent. In what way, then, could He be seen by the fathers, when certain angelical visions were shown to them, before that fullness of time at which it was fitting He should be sent, and so before He was sent, at a time when not yet sent He was seen as He is equal with the Father? For how does He say to Philip, by whom He was certainly seen as by all the rest, and even by those by whom He was crucified in the flesh, <q>Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, Philip? He that has seen me, has seen the Father also;</q> unless because He was both seen and yet not seen? He was seen, as He had been made in being sent; He was not seen, as by Him all things were made. Or how does He say this too, <q>He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him, and will manifest myself to him,</q>  at a time when He was manifest before the eyes of men; unless because He was offering that flesh, which the Word was made in the fullness of time, to be accepted by our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but was keeping back the Word itself, by whom all things were made, to be contemplated in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> by the mind when cleansed by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; The Sender and the Sent Equal. Why the Son is Said to Be Sent by the Father. Of the Mission of the Holy Spirit. How and by Whom He Was Sent. The Father the Beginning of the Whole Godhead.</h2>

<p>27. But if the Son is said to be sent by the Father on this account, that the one is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the other the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, this does not in any manner hinder us from believing the Son to be equal, and consubstantial, and co-eternal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and yet to have been sent as Son by the Father. Not because the one is greater, the other less; but because the one is Father, the other Son; the one begetter, the other begotten; the one, He from whom He is who is sent; the other, He who is from Him who sends. For the Son is from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, not the Father from the Son. And according to this manner we can now understand that the Son is not only said to have been sent because <q>the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>,</q>  but therefore sent that the Word might be made flesh, and that He might perform through His bodily presence those things which were written; that is, that not only is He understood to have been sent as man, which the Word was made but the Word, too, was sent that it might be made man; because He was not sent in respect to any inequality of power, or substance, or anything that in Him was not equal to the Father; but in respect to this, that the Son is from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, not the Father from the Son; for the Son is the Word of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, which is also called His wisdom. What wonder, therefore, if He is sent, not because He is unequal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but because He is <q>a pure emanation (<em>manatio</em>) issuing from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>?</q> For there, that which issues, and that from which it issues, is of one and the same substance. For it does not issue as water issues from an aperture of earth or of stone, but as light issues from light. For the words, <q>For she is the brightness of the everlasting light,</q> what else are they than, she is light of everlasting light? For what is the brightness of light, except light itself? And so co-eternal, with the light, from which the light is. But it is preferable to say, <q>the brightness of light,</q> rather than the light of light; lest that which issues should be thought to be darker than that from which it issues. For when one hears of the brightness of light as being light itself, it is more easy to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the former shines by means of the latter, than that the latter shines less. But because there was no need of warning men not to think that light to be less, which begot the other (for no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> ever dared say this, neither is it to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that any one will dare to do so), Scripture meets that other thought, whereby that light which issues might seem darker than that from which it issues; and it has removed this surmise by saying, <q>It is the brightness of that light,</q> namely, of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light, and so shows it to be equal. For if it were less, then it would be its darkness, not its brightness; but if it were greater, then it could not issue from it, for it could not surpass that from which it is educed. Therefore, because it issues from it, it is not greater than it is; and because it is not its darkness, but its brightness, it is not less than it is: therefore it is equal. Nor ought this to trouble us, that it is called a pure emanation issuing from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as if itself were not <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, but an emanation from the Omnipotent; for soon after it is said of it, <q>And being but one, she can do all things.</q>  But who is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, unless He who can do all things? It is sent, therefore, by Him from whom it issues; for so she is sought after by him who loved and desired her. <q>Send her,</q> he says, <q>out of Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> heavens, and from the throne of Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that, being present, she may labor with me;</q>  that is, may teach me to labor [heartily] in order that I may not labor [irksomely]. For her labors are <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But she is sent in one way that she may be with man; she has been sent in another way that she herself may be man. For, <q>entering into <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, she makes them friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>;</q>  so she also fills the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and works all things fitting for such ministries by them.  But when the fullness of time had come, she was sent,  not to fill <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, nor to be an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, except in so far as she announced the counsel of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, which was her own also; nor, again, to be with men or in men, for this too took place before, both in the fathers and in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; but that the Word itself should be made flesh, that is, should be made man. In which future <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, when revealed, was to be the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those wise and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men also, who, before He was born of the Virgin, were born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; and in which, when done and made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For this is <q>the great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of godliness, which  was manifest in the flesh, justified in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, seen of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, preached unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on in the world, received up into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> </p>

<p>28. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is sent by Him, of whom He is the Word; He is sent by Him, from whom He was begotten (<em>genitum</em>); He sends who begot, That is sent which is begotten. And He is then sent to each one, when He is apprehended and perceived by each, in so far as He can be apprehended and perceived, in proportion to the comprehension of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, either advancing towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or already perfect in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The Son, therefore, is not properly said to have been sent in that He is begotten of the Father; but either in that the Word made flesh appeared to the world, whence He says, <q>I came forth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and have come into the world;</q>  or in that from time to time, He is perceived by the mind of each, according to the saying, <q>Send her, that, being present with me, she may labor with me.</q>  What then is born (<em>natum</em>) from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, <q>for it is the brightness of the everlasting light;</q> but what is sent from time to time, is that which is apprehended by each. But when the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was made manifest in the flesh, He was sent into this world in the fullness of time, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. <q>For after that, in the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the world by wisdom <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not God</q> (since <q>the light shines in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not</q>), it <q>pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</q>  and that the Word should be made flesh, and dwell among us.  But when from time to time He comes forth and is perceived by the mind of each, He is said indeed to be sent, but not into this world; for He does not appear sensibly, that is, He does not present Himself to the corporeal senses. For we ourselves, too, are not in this world, in respect to our grasping with the mind as far as we can that which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; and the spirits of all the righteous are not in this world, even of those who are still living in the flesh, in so far as they have discernment in things divine. But the Father is not said to be sent, when from time to time He is apprehended by any one, for He has no one of whom to be, or from whom to proceed; since Wisdom says, <q>I came out of the mouth of the Most High,</q>  and it is said of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, <q>He proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q>  but the Father is from no one.</p>

<p>29. As, therefore, the Father begot, the Son is begotten; so the Father sent, the Son was sent. But in like manner as He who begot and He who was begotten, so both He who sent and He who was sent, are one, since the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are one.  So also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is one with them, since these three are one. For as to be born, in respect to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, means to be from the Father; so to be sent, in respect to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, means to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be from the Father. And as to be the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in respect to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, means to proceed from the Father; so to be sent, is to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to proceed from the Father. Neither can we say that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> does not also proceed from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, for the same Spirit is not without reason said to be the Spirit both of the Father and of the Son.  Nor do I see what else He intended to signify, when He breathed on the face of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and said, <q>Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q>  For that bodily breathing, proceeding from the body with the feeling of bodily touching, was not the substance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but a declaration by a fitting sign, that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> proceeds not only from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but also from the Son. For the veriest of madmen would not say, that it was one Spirit which He gave when He breathed on them, and another which He sent after His ascension.  For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> is one, the Spirit of the Father and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who works all in all.  But that He was given twice was certainly a significant economy, which we will discuss in its place, as far as the Lord may grant. That then which the Lord says&mdash;<q>Whom I will send unto you from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> &mdash; shows the Spirit to be both of the Father and of the Son; because, also, when He had said, <q>Whom the Father will send,</q> He added also, <q>in my name.</q>  Yet He did not say, Whom the Father will send from me, as He said, <q>Whom I will send unto you from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q>&mdash; showing, namely, that the Father is the beginning (<em>principium</em>) of the whole divinity, or if it is better so expressed, deity.  He, therefore, who proceeds from the Father and from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, is referred back to Him from whom the Son was born (<em>natus</em>). And that which the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says, <q>For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was not yet given, because that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not yet <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>;</q>  how is this to be understood, unless because the special giving or sending of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> after the glorification of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to be such as it had never been before? For it was not previously none at all, but it had not been such as this. For if the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was not given before, wherewith were the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who spoke filled? Whereas the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> plainly says, and shows in many places, that they spoke by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Whereas, also, it is said of John the Baptist, <q>And he shall be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, even from his mother's womb.</q> And his father Zacharias is found to have been filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, so as to say such things of him. And Mary, too, was filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, so as to foretell such things of the Lord, whom she was bearing in her womb.  And Simeon and Anna were filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, so as to acknowledge the greatness of the little child Christ.  How, then, was <q>the Spirit not yet given, since Jesus was not yet <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>,</q> unless because that giving, or granting, or mission of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was to have a certain speciality of its own in its very advent, such as never was before? For we read nowhere that men spoke in tongues which they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> coming upon them; as happened then, when it was needful that His coming should be made plain by visible signs, in order to show that the whole world, and all nations constituted with different tongues, should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ through the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, to fulfill that which is sung in the Psalm, <q>There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard; their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.</q> </p>

<p>30. Therefore man was united, and in some sense commingled, with the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, so as to be One Person, when the fullness of time had come, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, was sent into this world, that He might be also the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> for the sake of the sons of men. And this person angelic nature could prefigure beforehand, so as to pre-announce, but could not appropriate, so as to be that person itself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.&mdash; Of the Sensible Showing of the Holy Spirit, and of the Coeternity of the Trinity. What Has Been Said, and What Remains to Be Said.</h2>

<p>But with respect to the sensible showing of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, whether by the shape of a dove,  or by fiery tongues,  when the subjected and subservient creature by temporal motions and forms manifested His substance co-eternal with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and alike with them unchangeable, while it was not united so as to be one person with Him, as the flesh was which the Word was made;  I do not dare to say that nothing of the kind was done aforetime. But I would boldly say, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, of one and the same substance, God the Creator, the Omnipotent Trinity, work indivisibly; but that this cannot be indivisibly manifested by the creature, which is far inferior, and least of all by the bodily creature: just as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> cannot be named by our words, which certainly are bodily sounds, except in their own proper intervals of time, divided by a distinct separation, which intervals the proper syllables of each word occupy. Since in their proper substance wherein they are, the three are one, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the very same, by no temporal motion, above the whole creature, without any interval of time and place, and at once one and the same from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, as it were <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> itself, which is not without <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and charity. But, in my words, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are separated, and cannot be named at once, and occupy their own proper places separately invisible letters. And as, when I name my memory, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and will, each name refers to each severally, but yet each is uttered by all three; for there is no one of these three names that is not uttered by both my memory and my <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and my will together [by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as a whole]; so the Trinity together wrought both the voice of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the dove of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, while each of these things is referred severally to each person. And by this similitude it is in some degree discernible, that the Trinity, which is inseparable in itself, is manifested separably by the appearance of the visible creature; and that the operation of the Trinity is also inseparable in each severally of those things which are said to pertain properly to the manifesting of either the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>31. If then I am asked, in what manner either words or sensible forms and appearances were wrought before the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, which should prefigure it as about to come, I reply that God wrought those things by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and this I have also shown sufficiently, as I think, by testimonies of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>. And if I am asked how the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> itself was brought to pass, I reply that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> itself was made flesh, that is, was made man, yet not turned and changed into that which was made; but so made, that there should be there not only the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> and the flesh of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but also the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and that this whole should both be called God on account of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and man on account of man. And if this is understood with difficulty, the mind must be purged by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by more and more abstaining from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and by doing good works, and by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> with the groaning of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> desires; that by profiting through the divine help, it may both understand and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And if I am asked, how, after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Word, either a voice of the Father was produced, or a corporeal appearance by which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was manifested: I do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> indeed that this was done through the creature; but whether only corporeal and sensible, or whether by the employment also of the spirit rational or intellectual (for this is the term by which some choose to call what the Greeks name <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span>), not certainly so as to form one person (for who could possibly say that whatever creature it was by which the voice of the Father sounded, is in such sense <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father; or whatever creature it was by which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was manifested in the form of a dove, or in fiery tongues, is in such sense the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is that man who was made of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>?), but only to the ministry of bringing about such intimations as God judged needful; or whether anything else is to be understood: is difficult to discover, and not expedient rashly to affirm. Yet I see not how those things could have been brought to pass without the rational or intellectual creature. But it is not yet the proper place to explain, as the Lord may give me strength, why I so think; for the arguments of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> must first be discussed and refuted, which they do not produce from the divine books, but from their own reasons, and by which, as they think, they forcibly compel us so to understand the testimonies of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which treat of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as they themselves will.</p>

<p>32. But now, as I think, it has been sufficiently shown, that the Son is not therefore less because He is sent by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> less because both the Father sent Him and the Son. For these things are perceived to be laid down in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, either on account of the visible creature; or rather on account of commending to our thoughts the emanation [within the Godhead];  but not on account of inequality, or imparity, or unlikeness of substance; since, even if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father had willed to appear visibly through the subject creature, yet it would be most absurd to say that He was sent either by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, whom He begot, or by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who proceeds from Him. Let this, therefore, be the limit of the present book. Henceforth in the rest we shall see, the Lord helping, of what sort are those crafty arguments of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and in what manner they may be confuted.</p>
