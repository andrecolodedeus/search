<h1>On the Trinity (Book IV)</h1>

<div class="stiki"><p>Book IV. This book is in a sense the beginning of the treatise, and is sometimes cited later on as the first. Its three predecessors, he says in &sect; 1, had been written some time before. They had contained a statement of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> concerning the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and a summary refutation of the various <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. He now commences his main attack upon <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. First (&sect; 2) he repeats what his difficulty is; that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> language and thought cannot cope with the Infinite. Then (&sect; 3) he tells how the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> explain away the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Sonship of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. As a defence against this tampering with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has adopted the term <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">Homoousion</a> </em>(&sect;&sect; 4-7); Hilary explains and defends its use. In &sect; 8 he shows, by a collection of the passages of Scripture which they wrest to their own purposes, that such a definition is necessary, and in &sect;&sect; 9, 10 that their use of these passages is dishonest. In &sect; 11 he tells us exactly what the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> teaching is, and sets it forth in one of their own formularies, the <em>Epistola Arii ad Alexandrum </em>(&sect;&sect; 12, 13). In &sect; 14 this doctrine is denounced; it does not explain, but explains away. The proclamation made through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <em>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord your God is One</em>, upon which the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> take their stand, reveals only one aspect of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (&sect; 15). It does not exhaust the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for God is represented as not one solitary Person in the history of creation (&sect;&sect; 16-22), in the life of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> (&sect;&sect; 23-31), and in that of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> (&sect;&sect; 32-34). And this again is the teaching of the Prophets, as is shown by passages selected from Isaiah, Hosea, and Jeremiah (&sect;&sect; 35-42). All the evidence thus collected shows that in the Godhead there is both Father and Son, and that the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p></div>

<p>1. The earlier books of this treatise, written some time ago, contain, I think, an invincible <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that we hold and profess the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which is taught by the Evangelists and Apostles, and that no commerce is possible between us and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, inasmuch as they deny unconditionally, irrationally, and recklessly, the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. Yet certain points remained which I have felt myself bound to include in this and the following books, in order to make our assurance of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> even more certain by exposure of every one of their falsehoods and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>. Accordingly, we will enquire first what are the dangers of their teaching, the risks involved by such irreverence; next, what principles they hold, and what arguments they advance against the apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to which we adhere, and by what sleight of language they impose upon the candour of their hearers; and lastly, by what method of comment they disarm the words of Scripture of their force and meaning.</p>

<p>2. We are well aware that neither the speech of men nor the analogy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can give us a full insight into the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The ineffable cannot submit to the bounds and limits of definition; that which is spiritual is distinct from every class or instance of bodily things. Yet, since our subject is that of heavenly natures, we must employ ordinary natures and ordinary speech as our means of expressing what our mind apprehends; a means no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> unworthy of the majesty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but forced upon us by feebleness of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which can use only our own circumstances and our own words to convey to others our perceptions and our conclusions. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has been enforced already in the first book , but is now repeated in order that, in any analogies from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs which we adduce, we may not be supposed to think of God as resembling embodied natures, or to compare spiritual Beings with our passible selves, but rather be regarded as advancing the outward appearance of visible things as a clue to the inward meaning of things invisible.</p>

<p>3. For the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, that the Son is not born from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and is God not by nature but by appointment; in other words, that He has received an adoption which consists in the giving of a name, being God's Son in the sense in which many are sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; again, that Christ's majesty is an evidence of God's widespread bounty, He being God in the sense in which there are gods many; although they admit that in His adoption and naming as God a more liberal affection than in other cases was shown, His adoption being the first in order of time, and He greater than other adopted sons, and first in rank among the creatures because of the greater splendour which accompanied His creation. Some add, by way of confessing the omnipotence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He was created into God's likeness, and that it was out of nothing that He, like other creatures, was raised up to be the Image of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Creator, bidden at a word to spring from non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> into being by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who can frame out of nothing the likeness of Himself.</p>

<p>4. Moreover, they use their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the historical fact that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of a former time have taught that Father and Son are of one substance, to subvert the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by the ingenious plea that this is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> notion. They say that this term 'of one substance,' in the Greek <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a></em>, is used to mean and express that the Father is the same as the Son; that is, that He extended Himself out of infinity into the Virgin, and took a body from her, and gave to Himself, in the body which He had taken, the name of Son. This is their first lie concerning the <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a></em>. Their next lie is that this word <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a></em> implies that Father and Son participate in something antecedent to Either and distinct from Both, and that a certain imaginary substance, or <em>ousia</em>, anterior to all matter whatsoever, has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> heretofore and been divided and wholly distributed between the Two; which proves, they say, that Each of the Two is of a nature pro-existent to Himself, and Each identical in matter with the Other. And so they profess to condemn the confession of the <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a></em> on the ground that that term does not discriminate between Father and Son, and makes the Father subsequent in time to that matter which He has in common with the Son. And they have devised this third objection to the word <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a></em>, that its meaning, as they explain it, is that the Son derives His origin from a partition of the Father's substance, as though one object had been cut in two and He were the severed portion. The meaning of 'one substance,' they say, is that the part cut off from the whole continues to share the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that from which it has been severed; but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being impassible, cannot be divided, for, if He must submit to be lessened by division, He is subject to change, and will be rendered imperfect if His perfect substance leave Him to reside in the severed portion.</p>

<p>5. They think also that they have a compendious refutation of Prophets, Evangelists and Apostles alike, in their assertion that the Son was born within time. They pronounce us illogical for saying that the Son has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> from everlasting; and, since they reject the possibility of His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, they are forced to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He was born at a point in time. For if He has not always <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, there was a time when He was not; and if there be a time when He was not, time was anterior to Him. He who has not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> everlastingly began to exist within time, while He Who is free from the limits of time is necessarily <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. The reason they give for their rejection of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the Son is that His everlasting <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> contradicts the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His birth; as though by confessing that He has <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, we made His birth impossible.</p>

<p>6. What foolish and godless fears! What impious anxiety on God's behalf! The meaning which they profess to detect in the word <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a></em>, and in the assertion of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, is detested, rejected, denounced by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. She confesses one God from Whom are all things; she confesses one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, through whom are all things; One from Whom, One through Whom; One the Source of all, One the Agent through Whom all were created. In the One from Whom are all things she recognises the Majesty which has no beginning, and in the One through Whom are all things she recognises a might coequal with His Source; for Both are jointly supreme in the work of creation and in rule over <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things. In the Spirit she recognises God as Spirit, impassible and indivisible, for she has learned from the Lord that Spirit has neither flesh nor bones <span class="stiki" id="note330657"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;24:39</a></span>; a warning to save her from supposing that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being Spirit, could be burdened with bodily suffering and loss. She recognises one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unborn from everlasting; she recognises also one Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. She confesses the Father <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and without beginning; she confesses also that the Son's beginning is from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Not that He has no beginning, but that He is Son of the Father Who has none; not that He is self-originated, but that He is from Him Who is unbegotten from everlasting; born from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, receiving, that is, His birth from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the Father. Thus our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is free from the guesswork of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> perversity; it is expressed in fixed and published terms, though as yet no reasoned defence of our confession has been put forth. Still, lest any suspicion should linger around the sense in which the Fathers have used the word <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a></em> and round our confession of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, I have set down the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> whereby we may be assured that the Son abides ever in that substance wherein He was begotten from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that the birth of His Son has not diminished ought of that Substance wherein the Father was abiding; that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, inspired by the teaching of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when they said that the Son is <em>homoousios</em> with the Father pointed to no such flaws or defects as I have mentioned.  My purpose has been to counteract the impression that this <em>ousia</em>, this assertion that He is <em>homoousios</em> with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is a negation of the nativity of the Only-begotten Son.</p>

<p>7. To assure ourselves of the needfulness of these two phrases, adopted and employed as the best of safeguards against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> rabble of that day, I think it best to reply to the obstinate misbelief of our present <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and refute their vain and pestilent teaching by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. They flatter themselves that they can furnish a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> for each of their propositions; they have, in fact, appended to each some passages or other from <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Writ; passages so grossly misinterpreted as to ensnare none but the illiterate by the semblance of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with which perverted ingenuity has masked their explanation.</p>

<p>8. For they attempt, by praising the Godhead of the Father only, to deprive the Son of His Divinity, pleading that it is written, <em>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord your God is One</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330659"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:4</a></span>, and that the Lord repeats this in His answer to the doctor of the Law who asked Him what was the greatest commandment in the Law;&mdash; <em>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord your God is One</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330660"><a href="../bible/mar012.htm#verse29">Mark&nbsp;12:29</a></span> Again, they say that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> proclaims, <em>For there is One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and One Mediator between God and men</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330661"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> And furthermore, they insist that God alone is wise, in order to leave no wisdom for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, relying upon the words of the Apostle, <em>Now to Him that is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, according to the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which has been kept in silence through age-long times, but now is manifested through the scriptures of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> according to the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> God Who is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto all nations unto <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; to the only wise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, to Whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330662"><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;16:25-27</a></span> They argue also that He alone is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> , for Isaiah says, <em>They shall bless You, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330664"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse16">Isaiah&nbsp;65:16</a></span>, and the Lord Himself has borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, saying, <em>And this is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> that they should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Whom You have sent</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330665"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;17:3</a></span> Again they reason that He alone is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, to leave no goodness for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because it has been said through Him, <em>There is none good save One, even God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330666"><a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse18">Mark&nbsp;10:18</a></span>; and that He alone has power, because <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> has said, <em>Which in His own times He shall show to us, Who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330667"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:15</a></span> And further, they profess themselves certain that in the Father there is no change nor turning, because He has said through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <em>I am the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and I am not changed</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330668"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse6">Malachi&nbsp;3:6</a></span>, and the apostle James, <em>With Whom there is no change</em> ; certain also that He is the righteous Judge, for it is written, <em>God is the righteous Judge, strong and patient</em> ; that He cares for all, because the Lord has said, speaking of the birds, <em>And your heavenly. Father feeds them</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330671"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;6:26</a></span>, and, <em>Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And not one of them falls upon the ground without the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of your Father; but the very hairs of your head are numbered</em>.  They say that the Father has prescience of all things, as the blessed Susanna says, <em>O <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> secrets, and <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> all things before they be</em> ; that He is incomprehensible, as it is written, <em>The heaven is My throne, and the earth is the footstool of My feet. What house will you build Me, or what is the place of My rest? For these things has My hand made, and all these things are mine</em> ; that He contains all things, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, <em>For in Him we live and move and have our being</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330675"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse28">Acts&nbsp;17:28</a></span>, and the psalmist, <em>Whither shall I go from Your Spirit, and whither shall I fly from Your face? If I climb up into heaven, You are there; if I go down to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, You are present. If I take my wings before the light and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there Your hand shall lead me and Your right hand shall hold me</em> ; that He is without body, for it is written, <em>For God is Spirit, and they that worship Him must worship in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note330677"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;4:24</a></span>; that He is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and invisible, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <em>Who only has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and dwells in light unapproachable, whom no man has seen nor can see</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330678"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:16</a></span>, and the Evangelist, <em>No one has seen God at any time, except the Only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330679"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;1:18</a></span>; that He alone abides <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> unborn, for it is written, <em>I Am That I Am</em>, and <em>Thus shall you say to the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, I Am has sent me unto you</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330680"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;3:14</a></span>, and through Jeremiah, <em>O Lord, Who art Lord</em>. </p>

<p>9. Who can fail to observe that these statements are full of fraud and fallacy? Cleverly as issues have been confused and texts combined, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and folly is the character indelibly imprinted upon this laborious effort of cunning and clumsiness. For instance, among their points of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they have included this, that they confess the Father only to be unborn; as though any one on our side could suppose that He, Who begot Him through Whom are all things, derived His being from any external source. The very fact that He bears the name of <em>Father </em>reveals Him as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His Son's <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. That name of <em>Father </em>gives no hint that He who bears it is Himself descended from another, while it tells us plainly from Whom it is that the Son is begotten. Let us therefore leave to the Father His own special and incommunicable property, confessing that in Him reside the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> powers of an omnipotence without beginning. None, I am sure, can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the reason why, in their confession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, certain attributes are dwelt upon as peculiarly and inalienably His own, is that He may be left in isolated possession of them. For when they say that He alone is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, alone is righteous, alone is wise, alone is invisible, alone is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, alone is mighty, alone is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, they are raising up this word <em>alone </em>as a barrier to cut off the Son from His share in these attributes. He Who is alone, they say, has no partner in His properties. But if we suppose that these attributes reside in the Father only, and not in the Son also, then we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God the Son has neither <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> nor wisdom; that He is a bodily being compact of visible and material elements, ill-disposed and feeble and void of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; for we exclude Him from all these attributes of which we make the Father the solitary Possessor.</p>

<p>10. We, however, who propose to discourse of that most perfect majesty and fullest Divinity which appertains to the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, have no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest our readers should <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that amplitude of phrase in speaking of the Son is a detraction from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as though every praise assigned to the Son had first been withdrawn from Him. For, on the contrary, the majesty of the Son is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the Father; the Source must be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> from which He Who is worthy of such <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> comes. The Son has nothing but by virtue of His birth; the Father shares all veneration received by that birthright. Thus the suggestion that we diminish the Father's <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is put to silence, for all the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which, as we shall teach, is inherent in the Son will be reflected back, to the increased <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him who has begotten a Son so great.</p>

<p>11. Now that we have exposed their plan of belittling the Son under cover of magnifying the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the next step is to listen to the exact terms in which they express their own belief concerning the Son. For, since we have to answer in succession each of their allegations and to display on the evidence of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> the impiety of their doctrines, we must append, to what they say of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the decisions which they have put on record concerning the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that by a comparison of their confession of the Father with their confession of the Son we may follow a uniform order in our solution of the questions as they arise. They state as their verdict that the Son is not derived from any pre-existent matter, for through Him all things were created, nor yet begotten from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for nothing can be withdrawn from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but that He was made out of what was nonexistent, that is, that He is a perfect creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though different from His other creatures. They argue that He is a creature, because it is written, <em>The Lord has created Me for a beginning of His ways</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330682"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;8:22</a></span>; that He is the perfect handiwork of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though different from His other works, they prove, as to the first point, by what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> writes to the Hebrews, <em>Being made so much better than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as He possesses a more excellent name than they</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330683"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;1:4</a></span>, and again, <em>Wherefore, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who is faithful to Him that made Him</em>.  For their depreciation of the might and majesty and Godhead of the Son they rely chiefly on His own words, <em>The Father is greater than I</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330685"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;14:28</a></span> But they admit that He is not one of the common herd of creatures on the evidence of <em>All things were made through Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330686"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> And so they sum up the whole of their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> teaching in these words which follow:&mdash; </p>

<p>12. We confess One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, alone unmade, alone <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, alone unoriginate, alone <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, alone possessing <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, alone good, alone mighty, Creator, Ordainer and Disposer of all things, unchangeable and unalterable, righteous and good, of the Law and the Prophets and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that this God gave birth to the Only-begotten Son before all worlds, through Whom He made the world and all things; that He gave birth to Him not in semblance, but in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, following His own Will, so that He is unchangeable and unalterable, God's perfect creature but not as one of His other creatures, His handiwork, but not as His other works; not, as <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> maintained, that the Son is a development of the Father; nor, as Manich&aelig;us has declared of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, a consubstantial part of the Father; nor, as Sabellius, who makes two out of one, Son and Father at once; nor, as Hieracas, a light from a light, or a lamp with two flames; nor as if He was previously in being and afterwards born or created afresh to be a Son, a notion often condemned by yourself, blessed Pope , publicly in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and in the assembly of the brethren. But, as we have affirmed, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He was created by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of God before times and worlds, and has His life and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who gave Him to share His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> perfections. For, when the Father gave to Him the inheritance of all things, He did not thereby deprive Himself of attributes which are His without origination, He being the source of all things.</p>

<p>13. <q>So there are three Persons, Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for His part, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things, utterly unoriginate and separate from all; while the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, put forth by the Father outside time, and created and established before the worlds, did not exist before He was born, but, being born outside time before the worlds, came into being as the Only Son of the Only Father. For He is neither <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, nor co-eternal, nor co-uncreate with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor has He an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> collateral with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as some say, who  postulate two unborn principles. But God is before all things, as being indivisible and the beginning of all. Wherefore He is before the Son also, as indeed we have learned from you in your public preaching. Inasmuch then as He has His being from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> perfections, and His life, and is entrusted with all things, for this reason God is His source, and has rule over Him, as being His <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He is before Him. As to such phrases as <em>from Him</em>, and <em>from the womb</em>, and <em>I went out from the Father and have come</em>, if they be understood to denote that the Father extends a part and, as it were, a development of that one substance, then the Father will be of a compound nature and divisible and changeable and corporeal, according to them; and thus, as far as their words go, the incorporeal God will be subjected to the properties of matter. </q></p>

<p>14. Such is their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, such their pestilent teaching; to support it they borrow the words of Scripture, perverting its meaning and using the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of men as their opportunity of gaining credence for their lies. Yet it is certainly by these same words of God that we must come to understand the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feebleness cannot by any strength of its own attain to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of heavenly things; the faculties which deal with bodily matters can form no notion of the unseen world. Neither our created bodily substance, nor the reason given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the purposes of ordinary life, is capable of ascertaining and pronouncing upon the nature and work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Our wits cannot rise to the level of heavenly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, our powers of perception lack the strength to apprehend that limitless might. We must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> God's word concerning Himself, and humbly accept such insight as He vouchsafes to give. We must make our choice between rejecting His <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> do, or else believing in Him as He is, and this in the only possible way, by thinking of Him in the aspect in which He presents Himself to us. Therefore let private judgment cease; let <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reason refrain from passing barriers divinely set. In this spirit we eschew all <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> and reckless assertion concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and cleave to the very letter of revelation. Each point in our enquiry shall be considered in the light of His instruction, Who is our theme; there shall be no stringing together of isolated phrases whose context is suppressed, to trick and misinform the unpractised listener. The meaning of words shall be ascertained by considering the circumstances under which they were spoken; words must be explained by circumstances not circumstances forced into conformity with words. We, at any rate, will treat our subject completely; we will state both the circumstances under which words were spoken, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> purport of the words. Each point shall be considered in orderly sequence.</p>

<p>15. Their starting-point is this; We confess, they say, One only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says, <em>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord your God is One</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330690"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:4</a></span> But is this a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which anyone has ever dared to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>? Or was any believer ever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to confess otherwise than that there is One God from Whom are all things, One Majesty which has no birth, and that He is that unoriginated Power? Yet this fact of the Unity of God offers no chance for denying the Divinity of His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, or rather God through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, laid it down as His first commandment to that people, devoted both in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and in the Desert to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and the worship of imaginary gods, that they must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in One God. There was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and reason in the commandment, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from Whom are all things, is One. But let us see whether this <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> have not confessed that He, through Whom are all things, is also God. God is not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a>, He is still <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if His Son share the Godhead. For the case is that of God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of One from One, of God Who is One because God is from Him. And conversely the Son is not less God because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is One, for He is the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> unborn, so as to deprive the Father of His Oneness, nor yet different from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He is born from Him. We must not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that He is God by virtue of that birth from God which proves to us who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God is One; yet let us see whether <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who announced to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <em>The Lord your God is One</em>, has also proclaimed the Godhead of the Son. To make good our confession of the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> we must employ the evidence of that same <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> on whom the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> rely for the confession of One Only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> to involve the denial of the Godhead of the Son.</p>

<p>16. Since, therefore, the words of the Apostle, <em>One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, from Whom are all things, and one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our Lord, through Whom are all things</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330691"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:6</a></span>, form an accurate and complete confession concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let us see what <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> has to say of the beginning of the world. His words are, <em>And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water, and let it divide the water from the water. And it was so, and God made the firmament and God divided the water through the midst</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330692"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;1:6-7</a></span> Here, then, you have the God from Whom, and the God through Whom. If you deny it, you must tell us through whom it was that God's work in creation was done, or else point for your explanation to an <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> in things yet uncreated, which, when God said <em>Let there be a firmament</em>, impelled the firmament to establish itself. Such suggestions are inconsistent with the clear sense of Scripture. For all things, as the Prophet says <span class="stiki" id="note330693"><a href="../bible/2ma007.htm#verse28">2&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;7:28</a></span>, were made out of nothing; it was no transformation of existing things, but the creation into a perfect form of the non-existent. Through whom? Hear the Evangelist: <em>All things were made through Him</em>. If you ask Who this is, the same Evangelist will tell you: <em>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All things were made through Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330694"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1-3</a></span> If you are minded to combat the view that it was the Father Who said, <em>Let there be a firmament</em>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> will answer you: <em>He spoke, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created</em>.  The recorded words, <em>Let there be a firmament</em>, reveal to us that the Father spoke. But in the words which follow, <em>And it was so</em>, in the statement that God did this thing, we must recognise the Person of the Agent. <em>He spoke, and they were made</em>; the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> does not say that He willed it, and did it. <em>He commanded, and they were created; </em>you observe that it does not say they came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, because it was His pleasure. In that case there would be no office for a Mediator between God and the world which was awaiting its creation. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from Whom are all things, gives the order for creation which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through Whom are all things, executes. Under one and the same Name we confess Him Who gave and Him Who fulfilled the command. If you dare to deny that <em>God made </em>is spoken of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, how do you explain <em>All things were made through Him? </em>Or the Apostle's words, <em>One <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our Lord, through Whom are all things? </em>Or, <em>He spoke, and they were made? </em>If these inspired words succeed in convincing your stubborn <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, you will cease to regard that text, <em>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord your God is One</em>, as a refusal of Divinity to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, since at the very foundation of the world He Who spoke it proclaimed that His Son also is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But let us see what increase of profit we may draw from this distinction of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Who commands and God Who executes. For though it is repugnant even to our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> to suppose that in the words, <em>He commanded, and they were made</em>, one single and isolated Person is intended, yet, for the avoidance of all doubts, we must expound the events which followed upon the creation of the world.</p>

<p>17. When the world was complete and its inhabitant was to be created, the words spoken concerning him were, <em>Let Us make man after Our image and likeness</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330696"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> I ask you, Do you suppose that God spoke those words to Himself? Is it not obvious that He was addressing not Himself, but Another? If you reply that He was alone, then out of His own mouth He confutes you, for He says, <em>Let Us make man after Our image and likeness. </em>God has spoken to us through the Lawgiver in the way which is intelligible to us; that is, He makes us acquainted with His action by means of language, the faculty with which He has been pleased to endow us. There is, indeed, an indication of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> , through Whom all things were made, in the words, <em>And God said, Let there be a firmament</em>, and in, <em>And God made the firmament</em>, which follows: but lest we should think these words of God were wasted and meaningless, supposing that He issued to Himself the command of creation, and Himself <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> it&mdash;for what notion could be further from the thought of a solitary God than that of giving a verbal order to Himself, when nothing was necessary except an exertion of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>?&mdash; He determined to give us a more perfect assurance that these words refer to Another beside Himself. When He said, <em>Let Us make man after Our image and likeness</em>, His indication of a Partner demolishes the theory of His isolation. For an isolated being cannot be partner to himself; and again, the words, <em>Let Us make</em>, are inconsistent with solitude, while <em>Our </em>cannot be used except to a companion. Both words, <em>Us </em>and <em>Our</em> are inconsistent with the notion of a solitary God speaking to Himself, and equally inconsistent with that of the address being made to a stranger who has nothing in common with the Speaker. If you interpret the passage to mean that He is isolated, I ask you whether you suppose that He was speaking with Himself? If you do not understand that He was speaking with Himself, how can you assume that He was isolated? If He were isolated, we should find Him described as isolated; if He had a companion, then as not isolated. <em>I </em>and <em>Mine </em>would describe the former state; the latter is indicated by <em>Us </em>and <em>Our</em>.</p>

<p>18. Thus, when we read, <em>Let Us make man after Our image and likeness</em>, these two words <em>Us </em>and <em>Our </em>reveal that there is neither one isolated <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor yet one God in two dissimilar Persons; and our confession must be framed in harmony with the second as well as with the first <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For the words <em>our image</em>&mdash; not <em>our images</em>&mdash; prove that there is one nature possessed by Both. But an argument from words is an insufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, unless its result be confirmed by the evidence of facts; and accordingly it is written, <em>And God made man; after the image of God made He him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330698"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse27">Genesis&nbsp;1:27</a></span> If the words He spoke, I ask, were the soliloquy of an isolated <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what meaning shall we assign to this last statement? For in it I see a triple allusion, to the Maker, to the being made, and to the image. The being made is man; God made him, and made him in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If Genesis were speaking of an isolated <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it would certainly have been <em>And made him after His own image</em>. But since the book was foreshowing the Mystery of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, it spoke not of two Gods, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it speaks of man made through God in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus we find that God wrought man after an image and likeness common to Himself and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that the mention of an Agent forbids us to assume that He was isolated; and that the work, done after an image and likeness which was that of Both, proves that there is no difference in kind between the Godhead of the One and of the Other.</p>

<p>19. It may seem waste of time to bring forward further arguments, for truths concerning God gain no strength by repetition; a single statement suffices to establish them. Yet it is well for us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all that has been revealed upon the subject, for though we are not responsible for the words of Scripture, yet we shall have to render an account for the sense we have assigned to them. One of the many commandments which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave to <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> is, <em>Whoso sheds man's blood, for his blood shall his life be shed, for after the image of God made I man</em>.  Here again is the distinction between likeness, creature, and Creator. God bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that He made man after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. When He was about to make man, because He was speaking of Himself, yet not to Himself, God said, <em>After our image; </em>and again, after man was made, <em>God made man after the image of God</em>. It would have been no inaccuracy of language, had He said, addressing Himself, <em>I have made man after My image</em>, for He had shown that the Persons are one in nature by, <em>Let us make man after Our image</em>.  But for the more perfect removal of all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to whether God be, or be not, a solitary Being, when He made man He made him, we are told, <em>After the image of God</em>.</p>

<p>20. If you still wish to assert that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father in solitude said these words to Himself, I can go with you as far as to admit the possibility that He might in solitude have spoken to Himself as if He were conversing with a companion, and that it is credible that He wished the words <em>I have made man after the image of God </em>to be equivalent to <em>I have made man after My own image</em>. But your own confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will refute you. For you have confessed that all things are from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but all through the Son; and the words, <em>Let Us make man</em>, show that the Source from Whom are all things is He Who spoke thus, while <em>God made him after the image of God </em>clearly points to Him through Whom the work was done.</p>

<p>21. And furthermore, to make all self-deception unlawful, that Wisdom, which you have yourself confessed to be Christ, shall confront you with the words, <em>When He was establishing the fountains under the heaven, when He was making strong the foundations of the earth, I was with Him, setting them in order. It was I, over Whom He rejoiced. Moreover, I was daily rejoicing in His sight, all the while that He was rejoicing in the world that He had made, and in the sons of men</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330701"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse28">Proverbs&nbsp;8:28-31</a></span> Every difficulty is removed; <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> itself must recognise the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. There is with God Wisdom, begotten before the worlds; and not only present with Him, but setting in order, for She was <em>with Him, setting them in order</em>. Mark this work of setting in order, or arranging. The Father, by His commands, is the Cause; the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, by His execution of the things commanded, sets in order. The distinction between the Persons is marked by the work assigned to Each. When it says <em>Let us make</em>, creation is identified with the word of command; but when it is written, <em>I was with Him, setting them in order</em>, God reveals that He did not do the work in isolation. For He was rejoicing before Him, Who, He tells us, rejoiced in return; <em>Moreover, I was daily rejoicing in His sight, all the while that He was rejoicing in the world that He had made, and in the sons of men</em>. Wisdom has taught us the reason of Her <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. She rejoiced because of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who rejoices over the completion of the world and over the sons of men. For it is written, <em>And God saw that they were good</em>. She rejoices that God is well pleased with His work, which has been made through Her, at His command. She avows that Her <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> results from the Father's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> over the finished world and over the sons of men; over the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, because in the one man <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> had begun its course. Thus in the creation of the world there is no mere soliloquy of an isolated Father; His Wisdom is His partner in the work, and rejoices with Him when their conjoint labour ends.</p>

<p>22. I am aware that the full explanation of these words involves the discussion of many and weighty problems. I do not shirk them, but postpone them for the present, reserving their consideration for later stages of the enquiry. For the present I devote myself to that article of the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a>' <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or rather faithlessness, which asserts that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> proclaims the solitude of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We do not forget that the assertion is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the sense that there is One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from Whom are all things; but neither do we forget that this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is no excuse for denying the Godhead of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, since <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> throughout the course of his writings clearly indicates the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> and God. We must examine how the history of God's choice, and of the giving of the Law, proclaims God co-ordinate with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>23. After God had often spoken with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Sarah was moved to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> against Hagar, being jealous that she, the mistress, was barren, while her handmaid had conceived a son. Then, when Hagar had departed from her sight, the Spirit speaks thus concerning her, <em>And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord said unto Hagar, Return to your mistress, and submit yourself under her hands. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord said unto her, I will multiply your seed exceedingly, and it shall not be numbered for multitude, and again, And she called the Name of the Lord that spoke with her, You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who hast seen me</em>.  It is the Angel of God Who speaks , and speaks of things far beyond the powers which a messenger, for that is the meaning of the word, could have. He says, <em>I will multiply your seed exceedingly, and it shall not be numbered for multitude</em>. The power of multiplying nations lies outside the ministry of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Yet what says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> of Him Who is called the Angel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet speaks words which belong to God alone? <em>And she called the Name of the Lord that spoke with her, You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who hast seen me</em>. First He is the Angel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; then He is the Lord, for <em>She called the Name of the Lord; </em>then, thirdly, He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for <em>You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who hast seen me</em>. He Who is called the Angel of God is also Lord and God. The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is also, according to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, the <em>Angel of great counsel</em>.  To discriminate clearly between the Persons, He is called the Angel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; He Who is God from God is also the Angel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but, that He may have the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which is His due, He is entitled also Lord and God.</p>

<p>24. In this passage the one Deity is first the Angel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and then, successively, Lord and God. But to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> He is God only. For when the distinction of Persons had first been made, as a safeguard against the delusion that God is a solitary Being, then His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and unqualified name could safely be uttered. And so it is written. <em>And God said to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Behold Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him. And as far Ishmael, behold. I have heard you and have blessed him, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve nations shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330705"><a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;17:19-20</a></span> Is it possible to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that He Who was previously called the Angel of God is here, in the sequel, spoken of as God? In both instances He is speaking of Ishmael; in both it is the same Person Who shall multiply him. To save us from supposing that this was a different Speaker from Him who had addressed Hagar, the Divine words expressly attest the identity, saying, <em>And I have blessed him, and will multiply him</em>. The blessing is repeated from a former occasion, for Hagar had already been addressed; the multiplication is promised for a future day, for this is God's first word to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> concerning Ishmael. Now it is God Who speaks to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; to Hagar the Angel of God had spoken. Thus God and the Angel of God are One; He Who is the Angel of God is also God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. He is called the Angel because He is the <em>Angel of great counsel; </em>but afterwards He is spoken of as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lest we should suppose that He Who is God is only an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Let us now repeat the facts in order. The Angel of the Lord spoke to Hagar; He spoke also to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. One Speaker addressed both. The blessing was given to Ishmael, and the promise that he should grow into a great people.</p>

<p>25. In another instance the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> reveals through <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> that it was God Who spoke. He receives the further promise of a son, Isaac. Afterwards there appear to him three men. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, though he sees three, worships One, and acknowledges Him as Lord. Three were standing before him, <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, but he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> well Which it was that he must worship and confess. There was nothing in outward appearance to distinguish them, but by the eye of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the vision of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his Lord. Then the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> goes on, <em>And He said unto him, I will </em> <em>certainly return unto you at this time hereafter, and Sarah your wife shall have a son</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330706"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;18:10</a></span>; and afterwards the Lord said to Him, <em>I will not conceal from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> My servant the things that I will do</em> ; and again, <em>Moreover the Lord said, The cry of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> is filled up, and their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are exceeding great</em>.  Then after long discourse, which for the sake of brevity shall be omitted, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, distressed at the destruction which awaited the innocent as well as the guilty, said, <em>In no wise will You, Who judgest the earth, execute this judgment. And the Lord said, If I find in <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes</em>.  Afterwards, when the warning to <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> brother, was ended, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <em>And the Lord rained upon <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and upon <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven</em> ; and, after a while, <em>And the Lord visited Sarah as He had said, and did unto Sarah as He had spoken, and Sarah conceived and bare <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> a son in his old age, at the set time of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had spoken to him</em>.  And afterwards, when the handmaid with her son had been driven from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> house, and was dreading lest her child should die in the wilderness for want of water, the same <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says <em>And the Lord God heard the voice of the lad, where he was, and the Angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What is it, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the lad from the place where he is. Arise, and take the lad and hold his hand, for I will make him a great nation</em>. </p>

<p>26. What blind faithlessness it is, what dulness of an unbelieving heart, what headstrong impiety, to abide in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of all this, or else to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and yet neglect it! Assuredly it is written for the very purpose that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or oblivion may not hinder the recognition of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. If, as we shall prove, it is impossible to escape <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the facts, then it must be nothing less than <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> to deny them. This record begins with the speech of the Angel to Hagar, His promise to multiply Ishmael into a great nation and to give him a countless offspring. She listens, and by her confession reveals that He is Lord and God. The story begins with His appearance as the Angel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; at its termination He stands confessed as God Himself. Thus He Who, while He executes the ministry of declaring the great counsel is God's Angel, is Himself in name and nature God. The name corresponds to the nature; the nature is not falsified to make it conform to the name. Again, God speaks to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> of this same matter; he is told that Ishmael has already received a blessing, and shall be increased into a nation; I have blessed him, God says. This is no change from the Person indicated before; He shows that it was He Who had already given the blessing. The Scripture has obviously been consistent throughout in its progress from <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> to clear revelation; it began with the Angel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and proceeds to reveal that it was God Himself Who had spoken in this same matter.</p>

<p>27. The course of the Divine narrative is accompanied by a progressive development of doctrine. In the passage which we have discussed God speaks to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and promises that Sarah shall bear a son. Afterwards three men stand by him; he worships One and acknowledges Him as Lord. After this worship and acknowledgment by <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the One promises that He will return hereafter at the same season, and that then Sarah shall have her son. This One again is seen by <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in the guise of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and salutes him with the same promise. The change is one of name only; <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> acknowledgment in each case is the same. It was a Man whom he saw, yet <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> worshipped Him as Lord; he beheld, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> the coming Incarnation. Faith so strong has not missed its recognition; the Lord says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <em>Your father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> rejoiced to see My day; and he saw it, and was glad</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330713"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse56">John&nbsp;8:56</a></span> To continue the history; the Man Whom he saw promised that He would return at the same season. Mark the fulfilment of the promise, remembering meanwhile that it was a Man Who made it. What says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>? <em>And the Lord visited Sarah</em>. So this Man is the Lord, fulfilling His own promise. What follows next? <em>And God did unto Sarah as He had said</em>. The narrative calls His words those of a Man, relates that Sarah was visited by the Lord, proclaims that the result was the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You are sure that it was a Man who spoke, for <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> not only heard, but saw Him. Can you be less certain that He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when the same Scripture, which had called Him Man, confesses Him God? For its words are, <em>And Sarah conceived, and bare <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> a son in his old age, and at the set time of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had spoken to him</em>. But it was the Man who had promised that He would come. Believe that He was nothing more than man; unless, in fact, He Who came was God and Lord. Connect the incidents. It was, confessedly, the Man who promised that He would come that Sarah might conceive  and bear a son. And now accept instruction, and confess the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; it was the Lord God Who came that she might conceive and bear. The Man made the promise in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; by the same power God fulfilled the promise. Thus God reveals Himself both in word and deed. Next, two of the three men whom <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> saw depart; He Who remains behind is Lord and God. And not only Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also Judge, for <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> stood before the Lord and said, In no wise shall Thou do this things, to slay the righteous with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, for then the righteous shall be as the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. In no wise will You Who judgest the whole earth, execute this judgment. <span class="stiki" id="note330714"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse25">Genesis&nbsp;18:25</a></span> Thus by all his words <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> instructs us in that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for which he was justified; he recognises the Lord from among the three, he worships Him only, and confesses that He is Lord and Judge.</p>

<p>28. Lest you fall into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of supposing that this acknowledgment of the One was a payment of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to all the three whom <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> saw in company, mark the words of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> when he saw the two who had departed; <em>And when <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> saw them, he rose up to meet them, and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; and he said, Behold, my lords, turn in to your servant's house</em>.  Here the plural <em>lords </em>shows that this was nothing more than a vision of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; in the other case the faithful patriarch pays the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> due to One only. Thus the sacred narrative makes it clear that two of the three were mere <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; it had previously proclaimed the One as Lord and God by the words, <em>And the Lord said unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I then bear a child? But I am grown old. Is anything from God impossible? At this season I will return to you hereafter, and Sarah shall have a son</em>.  The Scripture is accurate and consistent; we detect no such confusion as the plural used of the One God and Lord, no Divine honours paid to the two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, calls them <em>lords</em>, while the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> calls them <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. The one is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reverence, the other literal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>29. And now there falls on <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> the vengeance of a righteous judgment. What can we learn from it for the purposes of our enquiry? <em>The Lord rained brimstone and fire from the Lord</em>. It is <em>The Lord from the Lord</em>; Scripture makes no distinction, by difference of name, between Their natures, but discriminates between Themselves. For we read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <em>The Father judges no man, but has given all judgment to the Son</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330717"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;5:22</a></span> Thus what the Lord gave, the Lord had received from the Lord.</p>

<p>30. You have now had evidence of God the Judge as Lord and Lord; learn next that there is the same joint ownership of name in the case of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and God. Jacob, when he fled through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of his brother, saw in his dream a ladder resting upon the earth and reaching to heaven, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God ascending and descending upon it, and the Lord resting above it, Who gave him all the blessings which He had bestowed upon <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Isaac. At a later time God spoke to him thus: <em>And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to the place Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an altar unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that appeared unto you when you fled from the face of your brother</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330718"><a href="../bible/gen035.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;35:1</a></span> God demands <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and makes it clear that demand is on behalf of Another than Himself. <em>He who appeared to you when you fled</em> are His words: He guards carefully against any confusion of the Persons. It is God Who speaks, and God of Whom He speaks. Their majesty is asserted by the combination of Both under Their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while the words plainly declare Their several <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.</p>

<p>31. Here again there occur to me considerations which must be taken into account in a complete treatment of the subject. But the order of defence must adapt itself to the order of attack, and I reserve these outstanding questions for discussion in the next book. For the present, in regard to God Who demanded <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it will suffice for me to point out that He Who was the Angel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He spoke with Hagar, was God and Lord when He spoke of the same matter with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; that the Man Who spoke with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was also God and Lord, while the two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who were seen with the Lord and whom He sent to <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, are described by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> as <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and nothing more. Nor was it to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> only that God appeared in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> guise; He appeared as Man to Jacob also. And not only did He appear, but, so we are told, He wrestled; and not only did He wrestle, but He was vanquished by His adversary. Neither the time at my disposal, nor the subject, will allow me to discuss the typical meaning of this wrestling. It was certainly God Who wrestled, for Jacob prevailed against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> saw God.</p>

<p>32. And now let us enquire whether elsewhere than in the case of Hagar the Angel of God has been discovered to be God Himself. He has been so discovered, and found to be not only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and of Isaac and of Jacob. For the Angel of the Lord appeared to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> from the bush; and Whose voice, think you, are we to suppose was heard? The voice of Him Who was seen, or of Another? There is no room for deception; the words of Scripture are clear: <em>And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire from a bush</em>, and again, <em>The Lord called unto him from the bush, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and he answered, What is it? And the Lord said, Draw not near hither, put off your shoes from off your feet, for the place whereon you stand is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ground. And He said unto him, I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob</em>.  He who appeared in the bush speaks from the bush; the place of the vision and of the voice is one; He Who speaks is none other than He Who was seen. He Who is the Angel of God when the eye beholds Him is the Lord when the ear hears Him, and the Lord Whose voice is heard is recognised as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. When He is styled the Angel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the fact is revealed that He is no self-contained and solitary Being: for He is the Angel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. When He is designated Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He receives the full title which is due to His nature and His name. You have, then, in the Angel Who appeared from the bush, Him Who is Lord and God.</p>

<p>33. Continue your study of the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> borne by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; mark how diligently he seizes every opportunity of proclaiming the Lord and God. You take note of the passage, <em>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord your God is One</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330720"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:4</a></span> Note also the words of that Divine song of his; <em>See, See, that I am the Lord, and there is no God beside </em>Me.  While God has been the Speaker throughout the poem, he ends with, <em>Rejoice, you heavens, together with Him and let all the sons of God praise Him. Rejoice, O you nations, with His people, and let all the Angels of God do Him <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a></em>.  God is to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the Angels of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and He says, <em>For I am the Lord, and there is no God beside Me</em>. For He is God the Only-begotten, and the title 'Only-begotten' excludes all partnership in that character, just as the title 'Unoriginate' denies that there is, in that regard, any who shares the character of the Unoriginate Father. The Son is One from One. There is none unoriginate except God the Unoriginate, and so likewise there is none only-begotten except God the Only-begotten. They stand Each single and alone, being respectively the One Unoriginate and the One Only-begotten. And so They Two are One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for between the One, and the One Who is His offspring there lies no gulf of difference of nature in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Godhead. Therefore He must be worshipped by the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Honour and reverence is demanded for God from the sons and from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Notice Who it is that shall receive this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and by whom it is to be paid. It is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and they are the sons and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And lest you should <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is not demanded for God Who shares our nature , but that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is thinking here of reverence due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>&mdash;though, indeed, it is in the Son that the Father must be honoured&mdash; examine the words of the blessing bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> upon Joseph, at the end of the same book. They are, <em>And let the things that are well-pleasing to Him that appeared in the bush come upon the head and crown of Joseph</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330724"><a href="../bible/deu033.htm#verse16">Deuteronomy&nbsp;33:16</a></span> Thus God is to be worshipped by the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but God Who is Himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And God is to be reverenced by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but God Who is Himself the Angel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For God appeared from the bush as the Angel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for Joseph is that he may receive such blessings as He shall please. He is none the less God because He is the Angel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and none the less the Angel of God because He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A clear indication is given of the Divine Persons; the line is definitely drawn between the Unbegotten and the Begotten. A revelation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of heaven is granted, and we are taught not to dream of God as dwelling in solitude, when <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and sons of God shall worship Him, Who is God's Angel and His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</p>

<p>34. Let this be taken as our answer from the books of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, or rather as the answer of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they can use his assertion of the Unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in disproof of the Divinity of God the Son; a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> in defiance of the clear warning of their own <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, for whenever he confesses that God is One he never fails to teach the Son's Divinity. Our next step must be to adduce the manifold utterance of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> concerning the same Son.</p>

<p>35. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the words, <em>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord your God is One;</em> would that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them aright! As you interpret them, I seek in vain for their sense. It is said in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <em><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You</em>.  Impress upon the reader's mind the distinction between the Anointer and the Anointed; discriminate between the <em>You</em> and the <em>Your: </em>make it clear to Whom and of Whom the words are spoken. For this definite confession is the conclusion of the preceding passage, which runs thus; <em>Your throne, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is for ever and ever; the sceptre of Your kingdom is a right sceptre. You have loved righteousness and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity. </em>And then he continues, <em>Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You</em>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> kingdom, in reward for His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of righteousness and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of iniquity, is anointed by His God. Surely some broad difference is drawn, some gap too wide for our mental span, between these names? No; the distinction of Persons is indicated by <em>You </em>and <em>Your</em>, but nothing suggests a difference of nature. <em>Your </em>points to the Author, <em>You </em>to Him Who is the Author's offspring. For He is God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as these same words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> declare, <em><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You</em>. And His own words bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that there is no God anterior to God the Un-originate; <em>Be My witnesses, and I am <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, says the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, and My Servant Whom I have chosen, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and understand that I am, and before Me there is no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor shall be after Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330726"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;43:10</a></span> Thus the majesty of Him that has no beginning is declared, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him that is from the Unoriginate is safeguarded; for <em><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You</em>. That word <em>Your </em>declares His birth, yet does not contradict His nature ; <em>Your God</em> means that the Son was born from Him to share the Godhead. But the fact that the Father is God is no obstacle to the Son's being God also, for <em><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You</em>. Mention is made both of Father and of Son; the one title of God conveys the assurance that in character and majesty They are One.</p>

<p>36. But lest these words, <em>For I am, and before Me there is no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor shall be after Me</em>, be made a handle for <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> presumption, as proving that the Son is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since after the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whom no God precedes, there follows no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the purpose of the passage must be considered. God is His own best interpreter, but His chosen Servant joins with Him to assure us that there is no God before Him, nor shall be after Him. His own <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> concerning Himself is, indeed, sufficient, but He has added the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the Servant Whom He has chosen. Thus we have the united testimony of the Two, that there is no God before Him; we accept the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because all things are from Him. We have Their <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> also that there shall be no God after Him; but They do not deny that God has been born from Him in the past. Already there was the Servant speaking thus, and bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the Father; the Servant born in that tribe from which God's elect was to spring. He sets forth also the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>: <em>Behold, My Servant Whom I have chosen, My Beloved in Whom My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is well pleased</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330728"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;12:18</a></span> This is the sense, then, in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> says, <em>There is no other God before Me, nor shall be after Me</em>. He reveals the infinity of His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and unchanging majesty by this assertion that there is no God before or after Himself. But He gives His Servant a share both in the bearing of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> and in the possession of the Name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>37. The fact is obvious from His own words. For He says to Hosea the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <em>I will no more have mercy upon the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, but will altogether be their enemy. But I will have mercy upon the children of Judah, and will save them in the Lord their God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330729"><a href="../bible/hos001.htm#verse6">Hosea&nbsp;1:6-7</a></span> Here <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father gives the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without any ambiguity, to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in Whom also He chose us before countless ages. <em>Their God</em>, He says, for while the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, being Unoriginate, is independent of all, He has given us for an inheritance to His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. In like manner we read, <em>Ask of Me, and I will give You the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> for Your inheritance</em>.  None can be God to Him from Whom are all things , for He is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and has no beginning; but the Son has <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from Whom He was born, for His Father. Yet to us the Father is God and the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the Father reveals to us that the Son is our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Son teaches that the Father is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over us. The point for us to remember is that in this passage the Father gives to the Son the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the title of His own unoriginate majesty. But I have commented sufficiently on these words of Hosea.</p>

<p>38. Again, how clear is the declaration made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father through Isaiah concerning our Lord! He says, <em>For thus says the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, Who made the things to come, Ask me concerning your sons and your daughters, and concerning the works of My hands command ye Me. I have made the earth and man upon it, I have commanded all the stars, I have raised up a King with righteousness, and all His ways are straight. He shall build My city, and shall turn back the captivity of My people, not for price nor reward, says the Lord of Sabaoth. <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> shall labour, </em> <em>and the merchandise of the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> and Sabeans. Men of stature shall come over unto You and shall be Your servants, and shall follow after You, bound in chains, and shall worship You and make supplication unto You, for God is in You and there is no God beside You. For You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not, O God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Saviour. All that resist Him shall be ashamed and confounded, and shall walk in confusion</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330732"><a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;45:11-16</a></span> Is any opening left for gainsaying, or excuse for <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>? If <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> continue, is it not in brazen defiance that it survives? God from Whom are all things, Who made all by His command, asserts that He is the Author of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, for, unless He had spoken, nothing had been created. He asserts that He has raised up a righteous King, who builds for Himself, that is, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a city, and turns back the captivity of His people, for no gift nor reward, for freely are we all saved. Next, He tells how after the labours of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and after the traffic of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> and Sabeans, men of stature shall come over to Him. How shall we understand these labours in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, this traffic of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> and Sabeans? Let us call to mind how the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> of the East worshipped and paid tribute to the Lord; let us estimate the weariness of that long pilgrimage to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> of Judah. In the toilsome journey of the Magian princes we see the labours of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> alludes. For when the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> executed, in their spurious, material way, the duty ordained for them by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the whole <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> world was offering in their person the deepest reverence of which its worship was capable. And these same <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> presented gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh from  the merchandise of the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> and Sabeans; a thing foretold by another <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, who has said, <em>The <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> shall fall down before His face, and His enemies shall lick the dust. The Kings of Tharsis shall offer presents, the Kings of the Arabians and Sabeans shall bring gifts, and there shall be given to Him of the gold of Arabia</em>.  The <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> and their offerings stand for the labour of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and for the merchandise of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> and Sabeans; the adoring <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> represent the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> world, and offer the choicest gifts of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to the Lord Whom they adore.</p>

<p>39. As for the men of stature who shall come over to Him and follow Him in chains, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> who they are. Turn to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>; Peter, when he is to follow his Lord, is girded up. Read the Apostles: <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, boasts of his bonds. Let us see whether this 'prisoner of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>' conforms in his teaching to the prophecies uttered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> concerning God His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. God had said, <em>They shall make supplication, for God is in You</em>. Now mark and digest these words of the Apostle:&mdash; <em>God was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, reconciling the world to Himself</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330735"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:19</a></span> And then the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> continues, <em>And there is no God beside You</em>. The Apostle promptly matches this with <em>For there is one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, through Whom are all things</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330736"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:6</a></span> Obviously there can be none other but He, for He is One. The third prophetic statement is, <em>You are God and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not</em>. But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, once the persecutor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, says, <em>Whose are the fathers, from Whom is Christ, Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over all</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330737"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;9:5</a></span> Such is to be the message of these men in chains; men of stature, indeed, they will be, and shall sit on twelve thrones to judge the tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and shall follow their Lord, witnesses to Him in teaching and in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p>

<p>40. Thus God is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it is God in Whom God dwells. But how is <em>There is no God beside You</em> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, if God be within Him? Heretic! In support of your confession of a solitary Father you employ the words, <em>There is no God beside Me; </em>what sense can you assign to the solemn declaration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <em>There is no God beside You</em>, if your explanation of <em>There is no God beside Me </em>be a denial of the Godhead of the Son? To whom, in that case, can God have said, <em>There is no God beside You? </em>You cannot suggest that this solitary Being said it to Himself. It was to the King Whom He summoned that the Lord said, by the mouth of the men of stature who worshipped and made supplication, <em>For God is in You. </em>The facts are inconsistent with solitude. <em>In You </em>implies that there was One present within range, if I may say so, of the Speaker's voice. The complete sentence, <em>God is in You</em>, reveals not only God present, but also God abiding in Him Who is present. The words distinguish the Indweller from Him in Whom He dwells, but it is a distinction of Person only, not of character. God is in Him, and He, in Whom God is, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The residence of God cannot be within a nature strange and alien to His own. He abides in One Who is His own, born from Himself. God is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because God is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <em>For You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not, O God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Saviour.</em></p>

<p>41. My next book is devoted to the refutation of your denial that God is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> continues, <em>All that resist Him shall be ashamed and confounded and shall walk in confusion.</em> This is God's sentence, passed upon your unbelief. You set yourself in opposition to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and it is on His account that the Father's voice is raised in solemn reproof; for He, Whose Godhead you deny, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And you deny it under cloak of reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He says, <em>There is no other God beside Me</em>. Submit to shame and confusion; the Unoriginate God has no need of the dignity you offer; He has never asked for this majesty of isolation which you attribute to Him. He repudiates your officious interpretation which would twist His words, <em>There is no other God beside Me, </em>into a denial of the Godhead of the Son Whom He begot from Himself. To frustrate your purpose of demolishing the Divinity of the Son by assigning the Godhead in some special sense to Himself, He rounds off the glories of the Only-begotten by the attribution of absolute Divinity:&mdash; <em>And there is no God beside You</em>. Why make distinctions between exact equivalents? Why separate what is perfectly matched? It is the peculiar characteristic of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> that there is no God beside Him; the peculiar characteristic of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father that there is no God apart from Him. Use His words concerning Himself; confess Him in His own terms, and entreat Him as King; <em>For God is in You, and there is no God beside You. For You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not, O God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Saviour</em>. A confession couched in words so reverent is free from the taint of presumption: its terms can excite no repugnance. Above all, we must remember that to refuse it means shame and ignominy. Brood in thought over these words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; employ them in your confession of Him, and so escape the threatened shame. For if you deny the Divinity of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, you will not be augmenting the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God by adoring Him in lonely majesty; you will be slighting the Father by refusing to reverence the Son. In <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and veneration confess of the Unoriginate God that there is no God beside Him; claim for God the Only-begotten that apart from Him there is no God.</p>

<p>42. As you have listened already to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Isaiah, so listen now to Jeremiah inculcating the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as they:&mdash; <em>This is our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there shall be none other likened unto Him, Who has found out all the way of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and has given it unto Jacob His servant and to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> His beloved. Afterward did He show Himself upon earth and dwelt among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a></em>.  For previously he had said, <em>And He is Man, and Who shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him</em> ? Thus you have God seen on earth and dwelling among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Now I ask you what sense you would assign to <em>No one has seen God at any time, save the Only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330740"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;1:18</a></span>, when Jeremiah proclaims God seen on earth and dwelling among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? The Father confessedly cannot be seen except by the Son; Who then is This who was seen and dwelt among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? He must be our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He is God visible in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, Whom men can handle. And take to heart the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> words, <em>There shall be none other likened to Him</em>. If you ask how this can be, listen to the remainder of the sentence, lest you be tempted to deny to the Father His share of the confession. <em>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord your God is One</em>. The whole passage is, <em>There shall be none likened unto Him, Who has found out all the way of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and has given it unto Jacob His servant and to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> His beloved. Afterward did He show Himself upon earth and dwelt among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a></em>. For there is one Mediator between God and Men, Who is both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a>; Mediator both in giving of the Law and in taking of our body. Therefore none other can be likened unto Him, for He is One, born from God into <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and He it was through Whom all things were created in heaven and earth, through Whom times and worlds were made. Everything, in fine, that exists owes its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to His action. He it is that instructs <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that speaks with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, that testifies to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that abides in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that was born through the Virgin from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, that nails to the cross of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> the powers that are our foes, that slays death in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, that strengthens the assurance of our hope by His Resurrection, that destroys the corruption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His Body. Therefore none shall be likened unto Him. For these are the peculiar powers of God the Only-begotten; He alone was born from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the blissful Possessor of such great prerogatives. No second god can be likened unto Him, for He is God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not born from any alien being. There is nothing new or strange or modern created in Him. When <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> hears that its God is one, and that no second god is likened, that men may deem him <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to God Who is God's Son, the revelation means that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and God the Son are One altogether, not by confusion of Person but by unity of substance. For the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> forbids us, because God the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to liken Him to some second deity.</p>
