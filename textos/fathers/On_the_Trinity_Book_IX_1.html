<h1>On the Trinity (Book IX)</h1>

<div class="stiki"><p>Book IX. After a summary (&sect; 1) of the results already obtained, Hilary returns, in &sect; 2, to certain of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> proof-texts, and warns his readers that their life depends on the recognition in Christ of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man, for it is this twofold <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which makes Him the Mediator (&sect; 3). Universal analogy and our consciousness of the capacity to rise to the life in God convince us of these two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> in Him, Who makes this rise possible (&sect; 4). But <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> lays hold of words spoken by Christ Incarnate, appropriate to His humility as Man, and assigns them to Him in His previous state; thus they make Him deny His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead. But His utterances before the Incarnation, during His life on earth, and after His return to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, must be carefully distinguished (&sect;&sect; 5, 6). Hilary now examines the aims and achievements of Christ Incarnate, and shows that His work for men was a Divine work, accomplished by Him for us only because He was throughout both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a>, the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> in Him being inseparable (&sect;&sect; 7-14). After reaching this conclusion from a general survey of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> life on earth, he examines in the light of it the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> arguments from isolated words. They assert that Christ refused to be called <em>Good</em> or <em>Master</em>. He refused neither title, and yet declared that both belong to God only (&sect;&sect; 15-18). And, indeed, He could not have associated Himself more closely than He did with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, while yet He kept His Person distinct (&sect; 19). The Father Himself bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the Son; and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and loss of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> is this, that, seeing the Father's works done by Christ, they did not see in Him the Son (&sect;&sect; 20, 21). The <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Christ is inseparable from that of God (&sect;&sect; 22, 23). The Scribe did well to confess the Divine unity, but was still outside the Kingdom because He did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ as God (&sect;&sect; 24-27). Next, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> argument from the words, <em>This is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Whom You have sent</em>, is refuted by comparison with cognate passages (&sect;&sect; 28-35). For, indeed, if the Father be the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Son must also be the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God (&sect; 36). That Divine nature which is common to Father and Son is subject to no limitations, and the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> generation can be illustrated by no analogy of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things (&sect; 37). Christ took humanity, and, since the Father's nature did not share in this, the unity was so far impaired. But humanity has been raised in Christ to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this could only be because His unity in the Divine nature with the Father was perfect. Otherwise the flesh which Christ took could not have entered into the Divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> (&sect; 38). There is but one <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Father and of Son; the Son sought in the Incarnation not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for the Word but for the flesh (&sect;&sect; 39, 40). The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Father and Son is one; in that unity the Son bestows, as well as receives, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> (&sect;&sect; 41, 42), and this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, common to Both, is evidence that the Divine nature also is common to Both (&sect; 42). Again, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> allege the words, <em>The Son can do nothing of Himself</em>, which Hilary shows, by an examination of the context, to be a support of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> (&sect;&sect; 43-46). The Son does the Father's work, not under compulsion as an inferior, but because They are One. His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is free, yet in perfect harmony with that of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because of their unity of nature (&sect;&sect; 47-50). The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> also appeal to the text, <em>The Father is greater than I</em>. The Father is, in fact, greater, first as being the Unbegotten, and secondly inasmuch as the Son has condescended to the state of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, yet without forfeiting His Godhead (&sect; 51). But He is not greater in nature than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, Who is His Image; or rather, the Begetter is the greater, while the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as the Begotten, is not less than He, for, although begotten, He had no beginning of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> (&sect;&sect; 52-57). Next, the allegation of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, based on St. <a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse32">Mark xiii. 32</a>, and therefore of difference in nature from God Omniscient is refuted (&sect;&sect; 58-62), both by express statements of Scripture and by a consideration of the Divine character. It is only in figurative senses that God is stated in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> sometimes to come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, sometimes to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of, particular facts (&sect;&sect; 63, 64). And so it is with Christ; His <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is but a wise and merciful concealment of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (&sect;&sect; 65-67). Yet the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, though they admit that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, being superior to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all the secrets of humanity, assert that He cannot penetrate the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of God (&sect; 68). But Christ expressly declares that He can and does, for Each is in the Other and is mirrored in the Other (&sect; 69). The <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> can be nothing but concealment. Only the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, i.e. He has told none but the Son; the Son does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, i.e. He wills not to reveal His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (&sect;&sect; 70, 71). God is unlimited; unlimited therefore in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The nature of Father and Son being one, it is impossible that the Son should be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. As in will, so in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, They are One (&sect;&sect; 72-74). And the Apostles, by repeating their question after the Resurrection, show that they were aware that His <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> meant reserve. And Christ did not, this time, speak of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, though He withheld the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which they asked (&sect; 75).</p></div>

<p>1. In the last book we treated of the indistinguishable nature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and demonstrated that the words, <em>I and the Father are One</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330958"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span>, go to prove not a solitary <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but a unity of the Godhead unbroken by the birth of the Son: for God can be born only of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and He that is born God of God must be all that God is. We reviewed, although not exhaustively, yet enough to make our meaning clear, the sayings of our Lord and the Apostles, which teach the inseparable nature and power of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; and we came to the passage in the teaching of the Apostle, where he says, <em>Take heed lest there shall be any one that leads you astray through <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain deceit, after the tradition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ; for in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330959"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse8">Colossians&nbsp;2:8-9</a></span> We pointed out that here the words, <em>in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily</em>, prove Him <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect God of His Father's nature, neither severing Him from, nor identifying Him with, the Father. On the one hand we are taught that, since the incorporeal God dwelt in Him bodily, the Son as God begotten of God is in natural unity with the Father: and on the other hand, if God dwelt in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, this proves the birth of the personal Christ in Whom He dwelt.  We have thus, it seems to me, more than answered the irreverence of those who refer to a unity or agreement of will such words of the Lord as, <em>He that has seen Me has seen the Father</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330961"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;14:9</a></span>, or, <em>The Father is in Me and I in the Father</em> , or, <em>I and the Father are One</em> , or, <em>All things whatsoever the Father has are Mine</em>.  Not daring to deny the words themselves, these false teachers, in the mask of religion, corrupt the sense of the words. For instance, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that where the unity of nature is proclaimed the agreement of will cannot be denied; but in order to set aside that unity which follows from the birth, they profess merely a relationship of mutual harmony. But the blessed Apostle, after many indubitable statements of the real <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, cuts short their rash and profane assertions, by saying, <em>in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily</em>, for by the bodily indwelling of the incorporeal God in Christ is taught the strict unity of Their nature. It is, therefore, not a matter of words, but a real <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that the Son was not alone, but the Father abode in Him: and not only abode, but also worked and spoke: not only worked and spoke, but also manifested Himself in Him. Through the Mystery of the birth the Son's power is the power of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, His authority the Father's authority, His nature the Father's nature. By His birth the Son possesses the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Father: as the Father's image, He reproduces from the Father all that is in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because He is the reality as well as the image of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for a perfect birth produces a perfect image, and the <em>fullness of the Godhead dwelling bodily in Him</em> indicates the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His nature.</p>

<p>2. All this is indeed as it is: He, Who is by nature God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must possess the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His origin, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> possesses, and the indistinguishable unity of a living nature cannot be divided by the birth of a living nature. Yet nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, under cover of the saving confession of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, are stealing on to the subversion of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: for by forcing their own interpretations on words uttered with other meanings and intentions, they are robbing the Son of His natural unity. Thus to deny the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, they quote the authority of His own words, <em>Why do you call Me good? None is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, save one, God</em>.  These words, they say, proclaim the Oneness of God: anything else, therefore, which shares the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot possess the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for God is One. And from His words, <em>This is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that they should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330966"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;17:3</a></span>, they attempt to establish the theory that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is called God by a mere title, not as being very God. Further, to exclude Him from the proper nature of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they quote, <em>The Son can do nothing of Himself except that which He has seen the Father do</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330967"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;5:19</a></span> They use also the text, <em>The Father is greater than I.</em>  Finally, when they repeat the words, <em>Of that day and that hour <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no one, neither the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in heaven, nor the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but the Father only</em> , as though they were the absolute renunciation of His claim to divinity, they boast that they have overthrown the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The birth, they say, cannot raise to equality the nature which the limitation of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> degrades. The Father's omniscience and the Son's <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> reveal unlikeness in the Divinity, for God must be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of nothing, and the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> cannot be compared with the omniscient. All these passages they neither understand rationally, nor distinguish as to their occasions, nor apprehend in the light of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, nor realize in the strict meaning of the words and so they impugn the divine nature of Christ with crude and insensate rashness, quoting single detached utterances to catch the ears of the unwary, and keeping back either the sequel which explains or the incidents which prompted them, though the meaning of words must be sought in the context before or after them.</p>

<p>3. We will offer later an explanation of these texts in the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and Epistles themselves. But first we hold it right to remind the members of our common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Eternal is presented in the same confession which gives <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.  He does not, he cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his own life, who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that Christ Jesus was very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as He was very man. It is equally perilous, whether we deny that Christ Jesus was God the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, or that He was flesh of our body: <em>Every one therefore who shall confess Me before men, him will I also confess before My Father which is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. But whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny before My Father which is in heaven</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330971"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;10:32-33</a></span> So said the Word made flesh; so taught the man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Lord of majesty, constituted Mediator in His own person for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and being in that very <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Mediatorship between men and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Himself one Person, both <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For He, being of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> united for that Mediatorship, is the full reality of each nature; while abiding in each, He is wanting in neither; He does not cease to be God because He becomes man, nor fail to be man because He remains for ever God. This is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> blessedness, to preach at once the Godhead and the manhood, to confess the Word and the flesh, neither forgetting the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He is man, nor ignoring the flesh, because He is the Word.</p>

<p>4. It is contrary to our experience of nature, that He should be born man and still remain <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but it accords with the tenor of our expectation, that being born man, He still remained <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for when the higher nature is born into the lower, it is credible that the lower should also be born into the higher. And, indeed, according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and habits of nature, the working of our expectation even anticipates the divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. For in every thing that is born, nature has the capacity for increase, but has no power of decrease. Look at the trees, the crops, the cattle. Regard man himself, the possessor of reason. He always expands by growth, he does not contract by decrease; nor does he ever lose the self into which he has grown. He wastes indeed with age, or is cut off by death; he undergoes change by lapse of time, or reaches the end allotted to the constitution of life, yet it is not in his power to cease to be what he is; I mean that he cannot make a new self by decrease from his old self, that is, become a child again from an old man. So the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of perpetual increase, which is imposed on our nature by natural law, leads us on good grounds to expect its promotion into a higher nature, since its increase is according to, and its decrease contrary to, nature. It was God alone Who could become something other than before, and yet not cease to be what He had ever been; Who could shrink within the limits of womb, cradle, and infancy, yet not depart from the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This is a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, not for Himself, but for us. The assumption of our nature was no advancement for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but His willingness to lower Himself is our promotion, for He did not resign His divinity but conferred divinity on man.</p>

<p>5. The Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, when He was born man of the Virgin, and in the fullness of time was about in His own person to raise humanity to divinity, always maintained this form of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> teaching. He taught, namely, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and exhorted to preach Him the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>; man saying and doing all that belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; God saying and doing all that belongs to man. Yet never did He speak without signifying by the twofold aspect of these very utterances both His manhood and His divinity. Though He proclaimed one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He declared Himself to be in the nature of the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His generation. Yet in His office as Son and His condition as man, He subjected Himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, since everything that is born must refer itself back to its author, and all flesh must confess itself weak before God. Here, accordingly, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> find opportunity to deceive the simple and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. These words, uttered in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> character, they <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> refer to the weakness of His divine nature; and because He was one and the same Person in all His utterances, they claim that He spoke always of His entire self.</p>

<p>6. We do not deny that all the sayings which are preserved of His, refer to His nature. But, if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> be man and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither God for the first time, when He became man, nor then ceasing to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor after He became Man in God less than perfect man and perfect <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His words must be one and the same with that of His nature. When according to the time indicated, we disconnect His divinity from humanity, then let us also disconnect His language as God from the language of man; when we confess Him <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> at the same time, let us distinguish at the same time His words as God and His words as man; when after His manhood and Godhead, we recognise again the time when His whole manhood is wholly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let us refer to that time all that is revealed concerning it.  It is one thing, that He was God before He was man, another, that He was man and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and another, that after being man and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He was perfect man and perfect God. Do not then confuse the times and natures in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the dispensation, for according to the attributes of His different natures, He must speak of Himself in relation to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His humanity, in one way before His birth, in another while He was yet to die, and in another as <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>

<p>7. For our sake, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, retaining all these attributes, and being born man in our body, spoke after the fashion of our nature without concealing that divinity belonged to His own nature. In His birth, His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, and His death, He passed through all the circumstances of our nature, but He bore them all by the power of His own. He was Himself the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His birth, He willed to suffer what He could not suffer, He died though He lives for ever. Yet God did all this not merely through man, for He was born of Himself, He suffered of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, and died of Himself. He did it also as man, for He was really born, suffered and died. These were the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the secret counsels of heaven, determined before the world was made. The Only-begotten God was to become man of His own will, and man was to abide <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. God was to suffer of His own will, that the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, working in the weakness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity, might not confirm the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in us, since God had assumed our weakness. God was to die of His own will, that no power, after that the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> God had constrained Himself within the law of death, might raise up its head against Him, or put forth the natural strength which He had created in it. Thus God was born to take us into Himself, suffered to justify us, and died to avenge us; for our manhood abides for ever in Him, the weakness of our infirmity is united with His strength, and the spiritual powers of iniquity and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> are subdued in the triumph of our flesh, since God died through the flesh.</p>

<p>8. The Apostle, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, and had received the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> through the Lord Himself, was not unmindful, that neither the world, nor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> could contain Him, for he writes, <em>Take heed, lest there shall be any one that leads you astray through <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain deceit, after the tradition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, after the rudiments of the world, and not after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, for in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and in Him you are made full, Who is the head of all principalities and powers</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330973"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse8">Colossians&nbsp;2:8-10</a></span> After the announcement that in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, follows immediately the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our assumption, in the words, <em>in Him you are made full</em>. As the fullness of the Godhead is in Him, so we are made full in Him. The Apostle says not merely <em>you are made full</em>, but, <em>in Him you are made full; </em>for all who are, or shall be, regenerated through the hope of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, abide even now in the body of Christ; and afterwards they shall be made full no longer in Him, but in themselves, at the time of which the Apostle says, <em>Who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330974"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians&nbsp;3:21</a></span> Now, therefore, we are made full in Him, that is, by the assumption of His flesh, for in Him dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Nor has this our hope a light authority in Him. Our fullness in Him constitutes His headship and principality over all power, as it is written, <em>That in His name every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things below, and every tongue confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father</em>.  Jesus shall be confessed in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, born in man, yet now no longer abiding in the infirmity of our body, but in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Every tongue shall confess this. But though all things in heaven and earth shall bow the knee to Him, yet herein He is head of all principalities and powers, that to Him the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> shall bow the knee in submission, in Whom we are made full, Who through the fullness of the Godhead dwelling in Him bodily, shall be confessed in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father.</p>

<p>9. But after the announcement of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> nature, and our assumption, that is, the fullness of Godhead abiding in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and ourselves made full in Him by His birth as man, the Apostle continues the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in the words, <em>In whom you were also <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> with a <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> not made with hands, in the stripping off of the body of the flesh, but with the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, having been buried with Him in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, wherein you were also raised with Him through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the working of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who raised Him from the dead</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330976"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse11">Colossians&nbsp;2:11-12</a></span> We are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> not with a fleshly <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> but with the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is, we are born again into a new man; for, being buried with Him in His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, we must die to the old man, because the regeneration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> has the force of resurrection. The <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of Christ does not mean the putting off of foreskins, but to die entirely with Him, and by that death to live henceforth entirely to Him. For we rise again in Him through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who raised Him from the dead; wherefore we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by Whose Working Christ was raised from the dead, for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> rises again in and with Christ.</p>

<p>10. Then is completed the entire <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the assumed manhood, <em>And you being dead through your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, you I say, did He quicken together with Him, having forgiven you all your trespasses, blotting out the bond written in ordinances, that was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and having put off from Himself His flesh, He has made a show of powers, triumphing over them in Himself</em>.  The worldly man cannot receive the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Apostle, nor can any language but that of the Apostle explain his meaning. God raised Christ from the dead; Christ in Whom the fullness of the Godhead dwelt bodily. But He quickened us also together with Him, forgiving us our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, blotting out the bond of the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which through the ordinances made aforetime was against us, taking it out of the way, and fixing it to His cross, stripping Himself of His flesh by the law of death, holding up the powers to show, and triumphing over them in Himself. Concerning the powers and how He triumphed over them in Himself, and held them up to show, and the bond which he blotted out, and the life which He gave us, we have already spoken.  But who can understand or express this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>? The working of God raises Christ from the dead; the same working of God quickens us together with Christ, forgives our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, blots out the bond, and fixes it to the cross; He puts off from Himself His flesh, holds up the powers to show, and triumphs over them in Himself. We have the working of God raising Christ from the dead, and we have Christ working in Himself the very things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in Him, for it was Christ who died, stripping from Himself His flesh. Hold fast then to Christ the man, raised from the dead by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and hold fast to Christ the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, working out our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> when He was yet to die. God works in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but it is Christ Who strips from Himself His flesh and dies. It was Christ who died, and Christ Who worked with the power of God before His death, yet it was the working of God which raised the dead Christ, and it was none other who raised Christ from the dead but Christ Himself, Who worked before His death, and put off His flesh to die.</p>

<p>11. Do you understand already the Mysteries of the Apostle's Faith? Do you think to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Christ already? Tell me, then, Who is it Who strips from Himself His flesh, and what is that flesh stripped off? I see two thoughts expressed by the Apostle, the flesh stripped off, and Him Who strips it off: and then I hear of Christ raised from the dead by the working of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If it is Christ Who is raised from the dead, and God Who raises Him; Who, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, strips from Himself the flesh? Who raises Christ from the dead, and quickens us with Him? If the dead Christ be not the same as the flesh stripped off, tell me the name of the flesh stripped off, and expound me the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Him Who strips it off. I find that Christ the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who was raised from the dead, is the same as He Who stripped from Himself His flesh, and that flesh, the same as Christ Who was raised from the dead; then I see Him holding principalities and powers up to show, and triumphing in Himself. Do you understand this triumphing in Himself? Do you perceive that the flesh stripped off, and He Who strips it off, are not different from one another? He triumphs in Himself, that is in that flesh which He stripped from Himself. Do you see that thus are proclaimed His humanity and His divinity, that death is attributed to the man, and the quickening of the flesh to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though He Who dies and He Who raises the dead to life are not two, but one Person? The flesh stripped off is the dead Christ: He Who raises Christ from the dead is the same Christ Who stripped from Himself the flesh. See His divine nature in the power to raise again, and recognise in His death the dispensation of His manhood. And though either function is performed by its proper nature, yet remember that He Who died, and raised to life, was one, Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>12. I remember that the Apostle often refers to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father as raising Christ from the dead; but he is not inconsistent with himself or at variance with the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for the Lord Himself says:&mdash; <em>Therefore does the Father <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Me, because I lay down My life, that I may take it again. No one shall take it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command have I received from the Father</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330979"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;10:17-18</a></span>: and again, when asked to show a sign concerning Himself, that they might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, He says of the Temple of His body, <em>Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise it up</em>.  By the power to take His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> again and to raise the Temple up, He declares Himself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Resurrection His own work: yet He refers all to the authority of His Father's command. This is not contrary to the meaning of the Apostle, when He proclaims Christ, the <em>power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330981"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:24</a></span>, thus referring all the magnificence of His work to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father: for whatever Christ does, the power and the wisdom of God does: and whatever the power and the wisdom of God does, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> God Himself does, Whose power and wisdom Christ is. So Christ was raised from the dead by the working of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for He Himself worked the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father with a nature indistinguishable from God's. And our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Resurrection rests on the God Who raised Christ from the dead.</p>

<p>13. It is this preaching of the double aspect of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Person which the blessed Apostle emphasises. He points out in Christ His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity, and His divine power and nature. Thus to the Corinthians he writes, <em>For though He was crucified through weakness, yet He lives through the power of God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330982"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:4</a></span>, attributing His death to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity, but His life to divine power: and again to the Romans, <em>For the death, that He died unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He died once: but the life, that He lives, He lives unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Even so reckon ye yourselves also to be dead unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330983"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;6:10-11</a></span>, ascribing His death to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that is, to our body, but His life to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose nature it is to live. We ought, therefore, he says, to die to our body, that we may live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, Who after the assumption of our body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, lives now wholly unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, uniting the nature He shared with us with the participation of divine <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</p>

<p>14. I have been compelled to dwell briefly on this, lest we should forget <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is being treated of as a Person of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, since He, Who was abiding in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, took the form of a servant, in which He was <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> even unto death. The <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of death has nothing to do with the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, just as the form of God is not inherent in the form of a servant. Yet through the Mystery of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> Dispensation the same Person is in the form of a servant and in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though it is not the same thing to take the form of a servant and to be abiding in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor could He Who was abiding in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, take the form of a servant without emptying Himself, since the combination of the two forms would be incongruous. Yet it was not another and a different Person Who emptied Himself and Who took the form of a servant. To take anything cannot be predicated of some one who is not, for he only can take who exists. The emptying of the form does not then imply the abolition of the nature: He emptied Himself, but did not lose His self: He took a new form, but remained what He was. Again, whether emptying or taking, He was the same Person: there is, therefore, a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, in that He emptied Himself, and took the form of a servant, but He does not come to an end, so as to cease to exist in emptying Himself, and to be non-existent when He took. The emptying availed to bring about the taking of the servant's form, but not to prevent Christ, Who was in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from continuing to be Christ, for it was in very deed Christ Who took the form of a servant. When He emptied Himself to become Christ the man, while continuing to be Christ the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the changing of His bodily fashion, and the assumption of another nature in His body, did not put an end to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> divinity, for He was one and the same Christ when He changed His fashion, and when He assumed our nature.</p>

<p>15. We have now expounded the Dispensation of the Mysteries, through which the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> deceive certain of the unlearned into ascribing to infirmity in the divinity, what Christ said and did through His assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and attributing to the form of God what is appropriate only to the form of the servant. Let us pass on, then, to answer their statements in detail. We can always safely distinguish the two kinds of utterances, since the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> lies in the confession of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> as Word and flesh, that is, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> consider it necessary to deny that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> by virtue of His nature was divine, because He said, <em>Why do you call Me good? None is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> save one, God</em>.  Now a satisfactory answer must stand in direct relation to the matter of enquiry, for only in that case will it furnish a reply to the question put. At the outset, then, I would ask these misinterpreters, <q>Do you think that the Lord resented being called good?</q> Would He rather have been called bad, as seems to be signified by the words, <em>Why do you call Me good? </em>I do not think any one is so unreasonable as to ascribe to Him a confession of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, when it was He Who said, <em>Come unto Me, all you that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me: for I am meek and lowly of heart, and you shall find rest unto your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light</em>.  He says He is meek and lowly: can we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> because He was called good? The two propositions are inconsistent. He Who witnesses to His own goodness would not repudiate the name of Good. Plainly, then, He was not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> because He was called good: and if we cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He resented being called good, we must ask what was said of Him which He did resent.</p>

<p>16. Let us see, then, how the questioner styled Him, beside calling Him good. He said, <em>Good Master, what good thing shall I do</em> ? Adding to the title of <q>good</q> that of master. If Christ then did not chide because He was called good, it must have been because He was called <q>good Master.</q> Further the manner of His reproof shows that it was the disbelief of the questioner, rather than the name of master, or of good, which He resented. A youth, who provides himself upon the observance of the law, but did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the end of the law <span class="stiki" id="note330987"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;10:4</a></span>, which is Christ, who thought himself justified by works, without perceiving that Christ came to <em>the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></em> , and to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the law cannot save through the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of justification , questioned the Lord of the law, the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as though He were a teacher of the common precepts and the writings of the law. But the Lord, abhorring this declaration of irreverent unbelief, which addresses Him as a teacher of the law, answered, <em>Why do you call Me good? </em>and to show how we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and call Him good, He added, <em>None is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, save one, God</em>, not repudiating the name of good, if it be given to Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>17. Then, as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that He resents the name <q>good master,</q> on the ground of the unbelief, which addresses Him as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He replies to the vain-<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> youth, and his boast that he had fulfilled the law, <em>One thing you lack, go, sell whatsoever you have, and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me</em>. There is no shrinking from the title of <q>good</q> in the promise of heavenly treasures, no reluctance to be regarded as <q>master</q> in the offer to lead the way to perfect blessedness. But there is reproof of the unbelief which draws an earthly opinion of Him from the teaching, that goodness belongs to God alone. To signify that He is both good and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He exercises the functions of goodness, opening the heavenly treasures, and offering Himself as guide to them. All the homage offered to Him as man He repudiates, but he does not disown that which He paid to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for at the moment when He confesses that the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, His words and actions are those of the power and the goodness and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>.</p>

<p>18. That He did not shrink from the title of good, or decline the office of master, but resented the unbelief which perceived no more in Him than body and flesh, may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the difference of His language, when the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> confessed Him their Master, <em>You call Me Master, and Lord, and you say well, for so I am</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330990"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;13:13</a></span>; and on another occasion, <em>Be not called masters, for Christ is your Master</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330991"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;23:10</a></span> From the faithful, to whom He is master, He accepts the title with words of praise, but here He rejects the name <q>good master,</q> when He is not acknowledged to be the Lord and the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and pronounces the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> alone good, but without distinguishing Himself from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He calls Himself Lord, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and guide to the heavenly treasures.</p>

<p>19. The Lord always maintained this definition of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which consists in teaching that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but without separating Himself from the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He declared Himself, by the nature which is His by birth, neither a second <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor the sole God. Since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the One God is in Him, He cannot be God of a different kind from Him; His birth requires that, being Son, it should be with a perfect Sonship.  So He can neither be separated from God nor merged in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence He speaks in words deliberately chosen, so that whatever He claims for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He signifies in modest language to be appropriate to Himself also. Take as an instance the command, <em>Believe in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also in Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330993"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;14:1</a></span> He is identified with God in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; how, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, can He be separated from His nature? He says, <em>Believe in Me also</em>, just as He said <em>Believe in God</em>. Do not the words <em>in Me </em>signify His nature? Separate the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, but you must separate also the two beliefs. If it be life, that we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God without Christ, strip Christ of the name and qualities of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if perfect life is given to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, only when they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ also, let the careful reader ponder the meaning of the saying, <em>Believe in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Me also</em>, for these words, uniting <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unite His nature to God's. He enjoins first of all the duty of belief in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but adds to it the command that we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Himself also; which implies that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God must also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. Yet He excludes the suggestion of a unity contrary to religion , for the exhortation <em>Believe in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Me also</em>, forbids us to think of Him as alone in solitude.</p>

<p>20. In many, nay almost all His discourses, He offers the explanation of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, never separating Himself from the divine unity, when He confesses <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and never characterising God as single and solitary, when He places Himself in unity with Him. But nowhere does He more plainly teach the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His unity and His birth than when He says, <em>But the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> which I have is greater than that of John, for the works which the Father has given Me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Me, that the Father has sent Me, and the Father which sent Me, He has borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His form. And you have not His word abiding in you, for Whom He sent, Him ye <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330995"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;5:36-38</a></span> How can the Father be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said to have borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, when neither He Himself was seen, nor His voice heard? Yet I remember that a voice was heard from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, which said, <em>This is My beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in Whom I have been well pleased; hear ye Him</em>.  How can it be said that they did not hear the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when the voice which they heard itself asserted that it was the Father's voice? But perhaps the dwellers in Jerusalem had not heard what John had heard in the solitude of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. We must ask, then, <q>How did the Father bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in Jerusalem?</q> It is no longer the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> given to John, who heard the voice from heaven, but a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> greater than that of John. What that <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is He goes on to say, <em>The works which the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works which I do, bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Me, that the Father has sent Me</em>. We must admit the authority of the testimony, for no one, except the Son sent of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, could do such works. His works are therefore His testimony. But what follows? <em>And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, which sent Me, He has borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form, and you have not His word abiding in you</em>. Are they blameless, in that they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who was never heard or seen among them, and Whose word was not abiding in them? No, for they cannot plead that His testimony was hidden from them; as Christ says, the testimony of His works is the testimony of the Father concerning Him. His works testify of Him that He was sent of the Father; but the testimony of these works is the Father's testimony; since, therefore, the working of the Son is the Father's testimony, it follows of necessity that the same nature was operative in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by which the Father testifies of Him. So Christ, Who works the works, and the Father Who testifies through them, are revealed as possessing one inseparable nature through the birth, for the operation of Christ is signified to be itself the testimony of God concerning Him.</p>

<p>21. They are not, therefore, acquitted of blame for not recognising the testimony; for the works of Christ are the Father's testimony concerning Him. Nor can they plead <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the testimony on the ground that they had not heard the voice of the Testifier, nor seen His form, nor had His word abiding in them. For immediately after the words, <em>You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form, and you have not His word abiding in you</em>, He points out why the voice was not heard, nor the form seen, and the word did not abide in them, though the Father had testified concerning Him: <em>For Whom He sent, Him ye <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not; </em>that is, if they had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Him, they would have heard the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and seen the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and His word would have been in them, since through the unity of Their nature the Father is heard and manifested and possessed in the Son. Is He not also the expression of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, since He was sent from Him? Does He distinguish Himself by any difference of nature from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when He says that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, testifying of Him, was neither heard, nor seen, nor understood, because they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, Whom the Father sent? The Only-begotten God does not, therefore, separate Himself from God when He confesses <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father; but, proclaiming by the word <q>Father</q> His relationship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He includes Himself in the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>22. For, in this very same discourse in which He pronounces that His works testify of Him that He was sent of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and asserts that the Father testifies of Him, that He was sent from Him, He says, <em>The <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Him, Who alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you seek not</em>.  This is not, however, a bare statement, without any previous preparation for the belief in His unity with the Father. Hear what precedes it, <em>You will not come to Me that you may have life. I receive not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from men. But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you, that you have not the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in yourselves. I have come in My Father's name, and you receive Me not: if another shall come in His name</em> , <em>him you will receive. How can you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, which receive <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from men, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him, Who alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you seek not.</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330999"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse40">John&nbsp;5:40-44</a></span> He disdains the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> should rather be sought of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is the mark of unbelievers to receive <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of one another: for what <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> can man give to man? He says He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is not in them, and pronounces, as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, that they do not receive Him coming in His Father's name. <q>Coming in His Father's name:</q> what does that mean but <q>coming in the name of God?</q> Is it not because they rejected Him Who came in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is not in them? Is it not implied that He has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He says, <em>You will not come to Me that you may have life</em>. Hear what He said of Himself in the same discourse, <em>Verily, verily, I say unto you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and they that hear shall live</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331000"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;5:25</a></span> He comes in the name of the Father: that is, He is not Himself the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, yet is in the same divine nature as the Father: for as Son and God it is natural for Him to come in the name of the Father. Then, another coming in the same name they will receive: but he is one from whom men will expect <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and to whom they will give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in return, though he will feign to have come in the name of the Father. By this, doubtless, is signified the <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, glorying in his false use of the Father's name. Him they will glorify, and will be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> of him: but the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him, Who alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they will not seek.</p>

<p>23. They have not the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in them, He says, because they rejected Him coming in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but accepted another, who came in the same name, and received <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of one another, but neglected the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him, Who is the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Is it possible to think that He separates Himself from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He gives as the reason why they seek not the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that they receive <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, and Himself they will not receive? To reject Him is to neglect the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; is not, then, His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if to receive Him steadfastly was to seek the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the only God? This very discourse is our <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>: for at its beginning we read, <em>That all may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, even as they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Father. He that honours not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, honours not the Father which sent Him</em>.  It is only things of the same nature that are equal in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; equality of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> denotes that there is no separation between the honoured. But with the revelation of the birth is combined, the demand for equality of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Since the Son is to be honoured as the Father , and since they seek not the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Him, Who is the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He is not excluded from the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is one and the same as that of God: just as <em>He that honours not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, honours not the Father also</em>, so he who seeks not the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeks not the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Christ also. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Christ is inseparable from the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. By His words, when the news of Lazarus' sickness was brought to Him, He illustrates the complete identification of Father and Son in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>: <em>This sickness is not unto death, but for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> through him.</em>  Lazarus dies for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> through him. Is there any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when the death of Lazarus, which is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, glorifies the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? Thus Christ is declared to be one in nature with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father through His birth, since the sickness of Lazarus is for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and at the same time the Mystery of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not violated, for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> through Lazarus. The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is to be regarded as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet He is none the less to be confessed also <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>: for by glorifying God through Lazarus, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</p>

<p>24. By the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the divine nature we are forbidden to separate the birth of the living Son from His living Father. The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> suffers no such change of kind, that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His Father's nature does not abide in Him. For even where, by the confession of one God only, He seems to disclaim for Himself the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God by the term <q>only,</q> nevertheless, without destroying the belief in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He places Himself in the unity of the Father's nature. Thus, when the Scribe asked Him, which is the chief commandment of the law, He answered, <em>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord our God is one Lord: you shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with all your spirit, and with all your strength. This is the first commandment. And the second is like it, You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself. There is none other commandment greater than these</em>.  They think that He severs Himself from the nature and worship of the One God when He pronounces as the chief commandment, <em>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord our God is one Lord</em>, and does not even make Himself the object of worship in the second commandment, since the law bids us to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our neighbour, as it bids us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one God. Nor must we pass over the answer of the Scribe, <em>Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> you have well said, that God is one, and there is none other but He: and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him with all the heart, and all the strength and all the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> his neighbour as himself, this is greater than all whole burnt offerings and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331005"><a href="../bible/mar012.htm#verse52">Mark&nbsp;12:52,&nbsp;33</a></span> The answer of the Scribe seems to accord with the words of the Lord, for He too proclaims the innermost and inmost <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and professes the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of one's neighbour as real as the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of self, and places <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of one's neighbour above all the burnt offerings of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. But let us see what follows.</p>

<p>25. <em>And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, He said unto him, You are not far from the kingdom of God</em>.  What is the meaning of such moderate praise? Believe in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with all your strength, and with all your heart, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself; if this be the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which makes man perfect for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>, why is not the Scribe already within, instead of <em>not far from the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>? </em>It is in another strain that He grants the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> to those who clothe the naked, feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, and visit the sick and the prisoner, <em>Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331007"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;25:34</a></span>; or rewards the poor in spirit, <em>Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a></em>.  Their gain is perfect, their possession complete, their inheritance of the kingdom prepared for them is secured. But was this young man's confession short of theirs? His ideal of duty raises <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of neighbour to the level of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of self; what more did he want to attain to the perfection of good conduct? To be occasionally charitable, and ready to help, is not perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; but perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has fulfilled the whole duty of charity, when a man leaves no debt to his neighbour unpaid, but gives him as much as he gives himself. But the Scribe was debarred from perfection, because he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which had been accomplished. He received, indeed, the praise of the Lord for his profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he heard the reply that he was not far from the kingdom, but he was not put in actual possession of the blessed hope. His course, though <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, was favourable; he put the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God before all things, and charity towards his neighbour on a level with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of self. And when he ranked the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God even higher than charity towards his neighbour, he broke through the law of burnt offerings and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; and that was not far from the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<p>26. We may perceive also, from the words of our Lord Himself, why He said, <em>You are not far from the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a></em>, rather than, <em>You shall be in the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a></em>. Then follows: <em>And no man after that dared ask Him any question. And Jesus answered and said, as He taught in the Temple, How say the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> that the Christ is the Son of David? David himself says in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit on My right hand, till I make Your enemies the footstool of Your feet </em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa109.htm#verse1">Psalm 110:1</a></span>. <em>David himself calls Him Lord, and whence is He his Son</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331009"><a href="../bible/mar012.htm#verse34">Mark&nbsp;12:34-37</a></span> <em>? </em>The Scribe is not far from the Kingdom of God when he confesses one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is to be loved above all things. But his own statement of the law is a reproach to him that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the law has escaped him, that he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Christ the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His birth to be included in the confession of the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>. The confession of one God according to the law seemed to leave no room for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the one Lord; so He asks the Scribe, how he can call Christ the Son of David, when David calls Him his Lord, since it is against the order of nature that the son of so great a Patriarch should be also his Lord. He would bid the Scribe, who regards Him only in respect of His flesh, and His birth from Mary, the daughter of David, to remember that, in respect of His Spirit, He is David's Lord rather than his son; that the words, <em>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord our God is one Lord</em>, do not sever Christ from the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the One Lord, since so great a Patriarch and Prophet calls Him his Lord, as the Son begotten of the Lord before the morning star. He does not pass over the law, or forget that none other is to be confessed Lord, but without violating the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the law, He teaches that He is Lord, in that He had His being by the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of a natural birth from the substance of the incorporeal God. He is one, born of one, and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the one Lord has made Him by nature Lord.</p>

<p>27. What room is any longer left for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>? The Lord Himself proclaiming that the chief commandment of the law is to confess and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the one Lord, proves Himself to be Lord not by words of His own, but by the Prophet's testimony, always signifying, however, that He is Lord, because He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. By <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of His birth He abides in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the birth transmitting with it, as it did, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God is not the issuing forth of another God with a different nature; and, because the generation is real, neither is the Father degraded from being Lord, nor is the Son born less than Lord. The Father retains His authority, the Son obtains His nature. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is one Lord, but the Only-begotten God the Lord is not separated from the One, since He derives His nature as Lord from the one Lord. Thus by the law Christ teaches that there is one Lord; by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> He proves Himself Lord also.</p>

<p>28. May the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> ever profit thus by the rash contentions of the ungodly to defend itself with the weapons of their attack, and conquering with the arms prepared for its destruction, prove that the words of the one Spirit are the doctrine of the one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>! For Christ is none other than He is preached, namely the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and abiding in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Just as He proclaims Himself Lord out of the law, even when He seems to deny the fact, so in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> He proves Himself the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even when He appears to confess the opposite. To escape the acknowledgment that He is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> plead that He said, <em>And this is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that they should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. and Him Whom You sent, even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331010"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;17:3</a></span> When He says, <em>You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em>, they think He excludes Himself from the reality of God by the restriction of solitariness; for the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God cannot be understood except as a solitary God. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> the Apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not suffer us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in two <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Gods, for nothing which is foreign to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> can be put on equality with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of that nature; and there is more than one God in the reality of the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if there exists outside the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God of another kind, not possessing by virtue of His birth the same nature with Him.</p>

<p>29. But by these very words He proclaims Himself plainly to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. To understand this, let our answer proceed from statements which He made previously, though the connection is unbroken right down to these words. We can then establish the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> step by step, and let the confidence of our freedom rest at last on the summit of our argument, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. There comes first the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His words, <em>He that has seen Me, has seen the Father; </em>and, <em>Do ye not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me? The words that I say unto you, I speak not from Myself; but the Father abiding in Me, Himself does His works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me: or else <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me for the very works' sake</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331011"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;14:9-11</a></span> At the close of this discourse, teeming with deep <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, follows the reply of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <em>Now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> we that You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things, and needest not that any man should ask you: by this we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that You came forth from God</em>.  They perceived in Him the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God by the divine powers which He exercised; for to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things, and to read the thoughts of the heart belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, not to the mere messenger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They confessed, therefore, that He had come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because the power of the divine nature was in Him.</p>

<p>30. The Lord praised their understanding, and answered not that He was sent from, but that He had come out from, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, signifying by the words <q>come out from</q> the great fact of His birth from the incorporeal God. He had already proclaimed the birth in the same language, when He said, <em>You <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Me, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that I came out from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and came from the Father into this world</em>.  He had come from the Father into this world, because He had come out from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To show that He signifies His birth by the coming out, He adds that He has come from the Father; and since He had come out from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He had come from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that <q>coming out,</q> followed, as it is, by the confession of the Father's name, is simply and solely the birth. To the Apostles, then, as understanding this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His coming out, He continues, <em>You <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> now, Behold the hour comes, yea has come, that you shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave Me alone: yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me</em>.  He would show that the <q>coming out</q> is not a separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but a birth, which by His being born continues in Him the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and therefore He adds that He is not alone, but the Father is with Him; in power, that is, and unity of nature, for the Father was abiding in Him, speaking in His words, and working in His works. Lastly to show the reason of this whole discourse, He adds, <em>These things I have spoken to you, that in Me ye may have peace. In this world you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331015"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;16:33</a></span> He has spoken these things unto them, that in Him they may abide in peace, not torn asunder by the passion of dissension over debates about the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He was left alone, but was not alone, for He had come out from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there abode still in Him the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from Whom He had come out. Therefore he bade them, when they were harassed in the world, to wait for His promises, for since He had come out from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God was still in Him, He had conquered the world.</p>

<p>31. Then, finally, to express in words the whole Mystery, He raised His eyes to heaven, and said, <em>Father, the hour has come: glorify Your Son, that Your Son may glorify You. Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that, whatsoever You have given Him, to them He should give <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life</em>.  Do you call Him weak because He asks to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>? So be it, if He does not ask to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in order that He may Himself glorify Him by Whom He is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. Of the receiving and giving of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> we have spoken in another book , and it would be superfluous to go over the question again. But of this at least we are certain, that He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in order that the Father may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by granting it. But perhaps He is weak in that He <em>receives </em>power over all flesh. And indeed the receiving of power might be a sign of weakness if He were not able to give to those whom He receives life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Yet the very fact of receiving is used to prove inferiority of nature. It might, if Christ were not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God by birth as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> as is the Unbegotten. But if the receiving of power signifies neither more nor less than the Birth, by which He received all that He has, that gift does not degrade the Begotten, because it makes Him perfectly and entirely what God is. God Unbegotten brought God Only-begotten to a perfect birth of divine blessedness: it is, then, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Father to be the Author of the Birth, but it is no degradation to the Son to be made the perfect image of His Author by a real birth. The giving of power over all flesh, and this, in order that to all flesh might be given <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, postulates the Fatherhood of the Giver and the Divinity of the Receiver: for by giving is signified that the One is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and in receiving the power to give <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, the Other remains God the Son. All power is therefore natural and congenital to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and though it is given, that does not separate Him from His Author, for that which is given is the property of His Author, power to bestow <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, to change the corruptible into the incorruptible. The Father gave all, the Son received all; as is plain from His words, <em>All things, whatsoever the Father has, are Mine</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331018"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;16:15</a></span> He is not speaking here of species of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, and processes of material change , but He unfolds to us the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the blessed and perfect Divinity, and teaches us that God is here manifested as the sum of His attributes, His power, His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, His authority; not that we should think that He possesses these as something extraneous to Himself, but that by these His qualities He Himself has been expressed in terms partly comprehensible by our sense. The Only-begotten, therefore, taught that He had all that the Father has, and that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> should receive of Him: as He says, <em>All things, whatsoever the Father has, are Mine; therefore I said, He shall take of Mine</em>.  All that the Father has are His, delivered and received: but these gifts do not degrade His divinity, since they give Him the same attributes as the Father.</p>

<p>32. These are the steps by which He advances the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself. He teaches that He has come out from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, proclaims that the Father is with Him, and testifies that He has conquered the world. He is to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and will glorify Him: He will use the power He has received, to give to all flesh <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Then hear the crowning point, which concludes the whole series, <em>And this is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that they should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him Whom You sent, even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></em>.  Learn, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, to confess, if you cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which gives <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Separate, if you can, Christ from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Son from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, God over all from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the One from the Only: if, as you say, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God without <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. But if there is no <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life in a confession of the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which separates Christ from Him, how, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, can Christ be separated from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when He is not separable for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>?</p>

<p>33. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that laboured solutions of difficult questions do not find favour with the reader, but it will perhaps be to the advantage of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> if I permit myself to postpone for a time the exposition of the full <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and wrestle against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> with these words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. You hear the statement of the Lord, <em>This is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that they should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him Whom You sent, even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></em>. What is it, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, which suggests to you that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God? No further indication is given to show you what you should think of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. There is nothing but <em><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>: </em>not <em><a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a></em>, as He generally called Himself: not <em><a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em>, as He often declared Himself: not <em>the living bread which comes down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note331022"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse51">John&nbsp;6:51</a></span>, as He repeated to the scandal of many. He says, <em>You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him Whom You sent, even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></em>, omitting all His usual names and titles, natural and assumed. Hence, if the confession of the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, gives us <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the name <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has here the full sense of that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>34. But perhaps by saying, <em>You the only</em>, Christ severs Himself from communion and unity with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yes, but after the words, <em>You the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em>, does He not immediately continue, and <em>Him Whom You sent, even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>? </em>I appeal to the sense of the reader: what must we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Christ to be, when we are commanded to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him also, as well as the Father the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God? Or, perhaps, if the Father is the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there is no room for Christ to be God. It might be so, if, because there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Christ were not the one Lord.  The fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is one, leaves Christ none the less the one Lord: and similarly the Father's one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead makes Christ none the less <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God: for we can only obtain <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as well as in the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</p>

<p>35. Come, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, what will your fatuous doctrine instruct us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> of Christ; Christ, Who dispenses <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, Who is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> of, and glorifies, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who overcame the world, Who, deserted, is not alone, but has the Father with Him, Who came out from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and came from the Father? He is born with such divine powers; what of the nature and reality of God will you allow Him? It is in vain that we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, unless we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also in Him, Whom He sent, even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Why do you hesitate? Tell us, what is Christ to be confessed? You deny what has been written: what is left, but to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what has not been written? O unhappy wilfulness! O <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> striving against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>! Christ is united in belief and confession  with the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father: what <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is it, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, to deny Him to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to call Him a creature, when it is no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God without Christ? But you are narrow, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, and unable to receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. The sense of the heavenly words escapes you; stung with the asp's poison of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, you forget that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is to be confessed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if we would obtain <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</p>

<p>36. But the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, while confessing the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, confesses Christ also. It does not confess Christ <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God without the Father the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor the Father the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God without Christ. It confesses Christ <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because it confesses the Father the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Thus the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God constitutes Christ also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. The Only-begotten God suffered no change of nature by His natural birth: and He Who, according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His divine origin was born God from the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is, by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of that nature, inalienable from the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Thus there follows from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> divine nature its necessary result, that the outcome of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> divinity must be a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth, and that the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> could not produce from Himself a God of a second kind. The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of God consists neither in simplicity, nor in multiplicity: for neither is there another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who springs from God with qualities of His own nature, nor does God remain as a single Person, for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth of the Son teaches us to confess Him as Father. The begotten God did not, therefore, lose the qualities of His nature: He possesses the natural power of Him, Whose nature He retains in Himself by a natural birth. The divinity in Him is not changed, or degenerate, for if His birth had brought with it any defect, it would more <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> cast upon the Nature, through which He came into being, the reflection of having failed to implant in its offspring the properties of itself. The change would not degrade the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, Who had passed into a new substance by birth, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who had been unable to maintain the constancy of His nature in the birth of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and had brought forth something external and foreign to Himself.</p>

<p>37. But, as we have often said, the inadequacy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> ideas has no corresponding inadequacy in the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and God the Son: as though there were extension, or series, or flux, like a spring pouring forth its stream from the source, or a tree supporting its branch on the stem, or fire giving out its heat into space. In these cases we have expansion without any separation: the parts are bound together and do not exist of themselves, but the heat is in the fire, the branch in the tree, the stream in the spring. So the thing itself alone has an independent <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; the one does not pass into the other, for the tree and the branch are one and the same, as also the fire and the heat, the spring and the stream. But the Only-begotten God is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, subsisting by virtue of a perfect and ineffable birth, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Scion of the Unbegotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, incorporeal offspring of an incorporeal nature, living and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God of living and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, God of a nature inseparable from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The fact of birth does not make Him God with a different nature, nor did the generation, which produced His substance, change its nature in kind.</p>

<p>38. Put in the dispensation of the flesh which He assumed, and through the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> whereby He emptied Himself of the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Christ, born man, took to Himself a new nature, not by loss of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or nature but by change of fashion. He emptied Himself of the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and took the form of a servant, when He was born. But the Father's nature, with which He was in natural unity, was not affected by this assumption of flesh; while Christ, though abiding in the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of His nature, yet in respect of the humanity assumed in this temporal change, lost together with the form of God the unity with the divine nature also. But the Incarnation is summed up in this, that the whole Son, that is, His manhood as well as His divinity, was permitted by the Father's gracious favour to continue in the unity of the Father's nature, and retained not only the powers of the divine nature, but also that nature's self. For the object to be gained was that man might become God. But the assumed manhood could not in any wise abide in the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless, through unity with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it attained to unity with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Then, since <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Word made flesh would in its turn also be in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus, if the flesh were united to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Word, the man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> could abide in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Word made flesh could be restored to the unity of the Father's nature, even as regards His manhood, since the assumed flesh had obtained the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Word. Therefore the Father must reinstate the Word in His unity, that the offspring of His nature might again return to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Himself: for the unity had been infringed by the new dispensation, and could only be restored perfect as before if the Father <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> with Himself the flesh assumed by the Son.</p>

<p>39. For this reason, having already so well prepared their minds for the understanding of this belief, the Lord follows up the words, <em>And this is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, that they should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him Whom You sent, even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></em>, with a reference to the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> displayed in His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, <em>I have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> You on the earth, I have accomplished the work which You gave Me to do</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331024"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;17:3-4</a></span> And then, that we might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the reward of His <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, and the secret purpose of the whole divine plan, He continued, <em>And now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with Your own self, with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had with You before the world was</em>.  Does any one deny that Christ remained in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him separable and distinct from the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God? Let him tell us what is the meaning of this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. <em>And now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with Your own self</em>. For what purpose should the Father glorify Him with His own self? What is the signification of these words? What follows from their signification? The Father neither stood in need of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, nor had He emptied Himself of the form of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. How should He glorify the Son with His own self, and with that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which He had with Him before the world was made? And what is the sense of <em>which He had with Him? </em>Christ does not say, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had before the world was made, when I was with You,</q> but, <em>The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had with You. When I was with You </em>would signify, <q>when I dwelt by Your side:</q> but <em>which I had with You </em>teaches the Mystery of His nature. Further, <em>Glorify Me with Yourself </em>is not the same as <q>Glorify Me.</q> He does not ask merely that He may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, that He may have some special <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His own, but <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that He may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> of the Father with Himself. The Father was to glorify Him with Himself, that He might abide in unity with Him as before, since the unity with the Father's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> had left Him through the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of the Incarnation. And this means that the glorifying should reinstate Him in that nature, with which He was united by the Mystery of His divine birth; that He might be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> of the Father with Himself; that He should resume all that He had had with the Father before; that the assumption of the servant's form should not estrange from Him the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should glorify in Himself the form of the servant, that it might become for ever the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He, Who had before abode in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was now in the form of a servant. And since the form of a servant was to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it was to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Him in Whose form the fashion of the servant's form was to be honoured.</p>

<p>40. But these words of the Lord are not new, or attested now for the first time in the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, for He testified to this very <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father glorifying the Son with Himself by the noble <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at the fulfilment of His hope, with which He rejoiced at the very moment when Judas went forth to betray Him. Filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> that His purpose was now to be fully accomplished, He said, <em>Now is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> and God is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Him. If God is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Him, He has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him in Himself, and straightway has He <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331026"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;13:31-32</a></span> How can we whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are burdened with bodies of clay, whose minds are polluted and stained with foul consciousness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, be so puffed up as to judge of His divine claim? How can we set up ourselves to criticise His heavenly nature, rebelling against God with our unhallowed and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> disputations? The Lord enunciated the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in the simplest words that could be found, and fitted His discourses to our understanding, so far as the weakness of our nature allowed Him, without saying anything unworthy of the majesty of His own nature. The signification of His opening words cannot, I think, be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>, <em>Now is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>; </em>that is, all the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which He obtains is not for the Word but for His flesh: not for the birth of His Godhead, but for the dispensation of His manhood born into the world. What then, may I ask, is the meaning of what follows, <em>And God is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Him? </em>I hear that God is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Him; but what that can be according to your interpretation, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. God is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Him, in the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, that is: tell me, then, is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> the same as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? And since the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> is not one and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> another, but He Who is <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is Himself also <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, Who, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, is the God Who is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in this <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, Who is also <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>?</p>

<p>41. So God is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, Who is also <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Let us see, then, what is this third clause which is added, <em>If God is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Him, God has also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him in Himself</em>. What, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, is this secret <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>? <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, glorifies a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> God in Himself! The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God is in the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God is in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Son of Man. God glorifies in Himself, but man is not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> through himself. Again the God Who is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the man, though He receives the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, yet is Himself none other than God. But since in the glorifying of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who glorifies, glorifies God in Himself, I recognise that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> nature is taken into the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of that nature which glorifies His nature. God does not glorify Himself; but He glorifies in Himself God <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in man. And this <q>glorifies in Himself,</q> though it is not a glorifying of Himself, yet means that He took the nature, which He <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, into the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His own nature since the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who glorifies the God <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in man, glorifies Him in Himself, He proves that the God Whom He glorifies is in Himself, for He glorifies Him in Himself. Come, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, whoever you be, produce the inextricable objections of your tortuous doctrine; though they bind themselves in their own tangles, yet, marshal them as you will, we shall not be in danger of sticking in their snares. The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>; God is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Him; God glorifies in Himself Him, Who is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the man. It is not the same that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, as that God is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, or that God glorifies in Himself Him, Who is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the man. Express in the terms of your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> belief, what you mean by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> being <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>. It must certainly be either Christ Who is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the flesh, or the Father Who is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. If it is Christ, Christ is manifestly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the flesh. If it is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, we are face to face with the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the unity, since the Father is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the Son. Thus, if you allow it to be Christ, despite yourself you confess Him <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; if you understand it of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, you cannot deny the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Let this be enough concerning the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> and God <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Him. But when we consider that God glorifies in Himself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, by what loophole, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, can your profane doctrine escape from the confession that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is very God according to the verity of His nature? God glorifies in Himself Christ, Who was born a man; is Christ then outside Him, when He glorifies Him in Himself? He restores to Christ in Himself the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which He had with Himself, and now that the servant's form, which He assumed, is in turn assumed into the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, God Who is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in man is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Himself; He was in God's self before the dispensation, by which He emptied Himself, and now He is united with God's self, both in the form of the servant, and in the nature belonging to His birth. For His birth did not make Him God of a new and foreign nature, but by generation He was made natural Son of a natural Father. After His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> birth, when He is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in His manhood, He shines again with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His own nature; the Father glorifies Him in Himself, when He is assumed into the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His Father's nature, of which He had emptied Himself in the dispensation.</p>

<p>42. The words of the Apostle's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are a barrier against your reckless and frenzied profanity, which forbids you to turn the freedom of speculation into licence, and wander into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. <em>Every tongue, he says, shall confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father</em>.  The Father has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him in Himself, therefore He must be confessed in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father. And if He is to be confessed in the Father's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the Father has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him in Himself, is He not plainly all that His Father is, since the Father has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him in Himself and He is to be confessed in the Father's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? He is now not merely in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. The Father glorifies Him, not with a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from without, but in Himself. By taking Him back into that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which belongs to Himself, and which He had with Him before, the Father glorifies Him with Himself and in Himself. Therefore this confession is inseparable from Christ even in the humiliation of His manhood, as He says, <em>And this is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, that they should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Him, Whom You sent, even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note331028"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;17:3</a></span>; for firstly there is no life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in the confession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father without <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and secondly Christ is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the Father. Eternal life is precisely this, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and Him, Whom He sent, even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; deny that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if you can have life by believing in God without Him. As for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; let this be untrue of the God Christ, unless Christ's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is wholly in the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. For if the Father glorifies Him in Himself, and the Father is the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Christ is not outside the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who is the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, glorifies in Himself Christ, Who is raised into the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And in that He is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God in Himself, He is not estranged from the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God in Himself, the only God.</p>

<p>43. But perhaps the godless unbeliever meets the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> believer with the assertion that we cannot understand of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God a confession of powerlessness, such as, <em>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He has seen the Father doing</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331029"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;5:19</a></span> If the twofold <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>  of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had not demanded a twofold answer, it would indeed have been a confession of weakness, that the Son could do nothing of Himself, except what He had seen the Father doing. But Christ was answering in the same sentence the double charge of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who accused Him of violating the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and of making Himself equal with God by calling God His Father. Do you think, then, that by fixing attention upon the form of His reply you can withdraw it for the substance? We have already treated of this passage in another book ; yet as the exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> gains rather than loses by repetition, let us ponder once more on the words, since the occasion demands it of us.</p>

<p>44. Hear how the necessity for the reply arose:&mdash; <em>And for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> did the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and sought to kill Him, because He did these things on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331032"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;5:16</a></span> Their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> was so kindled against Him, that they desired to kill Him, because He did His works on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. But let us see also what the Lord answered, <em>My Father works even until now, and I work</em>.  Tell us, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, what is that work of the Father; since through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, are all things, visible and invisible? You, who are wise beyond the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, have doubtless obtained from some other secret source of learning the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father's work, to reveal Him to us. But the Father works in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as the Son Himself says, <em>The words that I say unto you, I speak not from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works</em>.  Do you grasp the meaning of the words, <em>My Father works even until now? </em>He speaks that we may recognise in Him the power of the Father's nature employing the nature, which has that power, to work on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. The Father works in Him while He works; without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, then, He works along with the working of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and therefore He says, <em>My Father works even until now</em>, that this present work of His words and actions may be regarded as the working of the Father's nature in Himself. This <em>works even until now </em>identifies the time with the moment of speaking, and therefore we must regard Him as referring to that very work of the Father's which He was then doing, for it implies the working of the Father at the very time of His words. And lest the Faith, being restricted to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father only, should fail of the hope of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, He adds at once, <em>And I work; </em>that is, what the Father works even until now, the Son also works. Thus He expounds the whole of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for the work which is now, belongs to the present time; and if the Father works, and the Son works, no union exists between them, which merges them into a single Person.  But the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the bystanders is now redoubled. Hear what follows, <em>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> sought the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, but because He called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331036"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;5:18</a></span> Allow me here to repeat that, by the judgment of the Evangelist and by common consent of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, the Son is in equality with the Father's nature; and that equality cannot exist except by identity of nature. The begotten cannot derive what it is save from its source and the thing generated cannot be foreign to that which generates it, since from that alone has it come to be what it is. Let us see, then, what the Lord replied to this double outburst of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, <em>Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He has seen the Father doing: for what things soever He does, these the Son also does in like manner</em>. </p>

<p>45. Unless we regard these words as an integral part of His statement, we do them <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> by forcing upon them an arbitrary and unbelieving interpretation. But if His answer refers to the grounds of their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> expresses rightly what He meant to teach, and the perversity of the ungodly is left without support for its profane delusion. Let us see then whether this reply is suitable to an accusation of working on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. <em>The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He has seen the Father doing</em>. He has said just above, <em>My Father works even until now, and I work</em>. If by virtue of the authority of the Father's nature within Him, all that He works, He works with the Father in Him, and the Father works even until now on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, then the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, Who pleads the authority of the Father's working, is acquitted of blame. For the words, <em>can do nothing</em>, refer not to strength but to authority; He can do nothing of Himself, except what He has seen. Now, to have seen does not confer the power to do, and therefore He is not weak, if He can do nothing without having seen, but His authority is shown to depend on seeing. Again the words, <em>unless He has seen</em>, signify the consciousness derived from seeing, as when He says to the Apostles, <em>Behold I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331038"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;4:35</a></span> With the consciousness that the Father's nature is abiding in Him, and working in Him when He works, to forestall the idea that the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> has violated the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, He pronounces that, <em>The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He has seen the Father doing. </em>And thus He demonstrates that His every action springs from His consciousness of the nature working within Him; when He works on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, the Father works even until now on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. In what follows, however, He refers to the second <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their indignation, <em>For what things soever He does, the Son does in like manner</em>. Is it false that, what things soever the Father does, the Son does in like manner? Does the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> admit a distinction between the Father's power and working and His own? Does He shrink from claiming the equality of homage befitting an equal in power and nature? If He does, disdain His weakness, and degrade Him from equality of nature with the Father. But He Himself says only a little later, <em>That all may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, even as they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He that honours not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, honours not the Father which sent Him</em>.  Discover, if you can, the inferiority, when Both are equal in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; make out the weakness, when Both work with the same power.</p>

<p>46. Why do you misrepresent the occasion of the reply in order to detract from His divinity? To the working on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> He answers that He can do nothing of Himself, but what He has seen the Father doing: to demonstrate His equality, He professes to do what things soever the Father does. Enforce your charge of weakness, by His answer concerning the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, if you can disprove that <em>what things soever the Father does, the Son does in like manner</em>. But if what things soever includes all things without exception; in what is He found weak, when there is nothing that the Father does, which He cannot also do? Where is His claim to equality refuted by any episode of weakness, when one and the same <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is demanded for Him and for the Father? If Both have the same power in operation, and both claim the same reverence in worship, I cannot understand what dishonour of inferiority can exist, since Father and Son possess the same power of operation, and equality of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</p>

<p>47. Although we have treated this passage as the facts themselves explain it, yet to prove that the Lord's words, <em>The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He has seen the Father doing</em>, so far from supporting this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> degradation of His nature, testify to His conscious possession of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by Whose authority He worked on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, let us show them that we can produce another saying of the Lord, which bears upon the question, <em>I do nothing of Myself, but as the Father taught Me, I speak these things. And He that sent Me is with Me: He has not left Me alone, for I do always the things that are pleasing to Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331040"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;8:28-29</a></span> Do you feel what is implied in the words, <em>The Son can do nothing, but what He has seen the Father doing? </em>Or what a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is contained in the saying, <em>I can do nothing of myself, and He has not left me alone, for I do always the things that are pleasing to Him?</em> He does nothing of Himself, because the Father abides in Him; can you reconcile with this the fact that the Father does not leave Him, because He does the things which are pleasing to Him? Your interpretation, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, sets up a contradiction between these two statements, that He does nothing of Himself, unless taught of the Father abiding in Him, and that the Father abides in Him, because He does always the things which are pleasing to Him. For if the Father's abiding in Him means that He does nothing of Himself, how could He have deserved that the Father should abide in Him, by doing always the things which are pleasing to the Father. It is no merit, not to do of oneself what one does. Conversely, how are the Son's <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> pleasing to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, if the Father Himself, abiding in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, be their Author? Impiety, you are in a sore strait; the well-armed <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has hemmed you in. The Son is either an Agent, or He is not. If He is not an Agent, how does He please by his acts? If He is an Agent, in what sense are <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, done <em>not of Himself</em>, His own? On the one hand, He must have done the things which are pleasing; on the other, it is no merit to have done, yet not of oneself, what one does.</p>

<p>48. But, my opponent, the unity of Their nature is such, that the several action of Each implies the conjoint action of Both, and Their joint activity a several activity of Each. Conceive the Son acting, and the Father acting through Him. He acts not of Himself, for we have to explain how the Father abides in Him. He acts in His own Person, for in accordance with His birth as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, He does Himself what is pleasing. His acting <em>not of Himself</em> would prove Him weak, were it not the case that He so acts that what He does is pleasing to the Father. But He would not be in the unity of the divine nature, if the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which He does, and wherein He pleases, were not His own, and He were merely prompted to action by the Father abiding in Him. The Father then in abiding in Him, teaches Him, and the Son in acting, acts not of Himself; while, on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, though not acting of Himself, acts Himself, for what He does is pleasing. Thus is the unity of Their nature retained in Their action, for the One, though He acts Himself, does not act of Himself, while the Other, Who has abstained from action, is yet active.</p>

<p>49. Connect with this that saying, which you lay hold of to support the imputation of infirmity, <em>All that the Father gives Me shall come unto Me, and him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out; for I have come down from heaven not to do My own will, but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father that sent Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331041"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;6:37-38</a></span> But, perhaps you say, the Son has no freedom of will: the weakness of His nature subjects Him to necessity, and He is denied <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, and subjected to necessity that He may not reject those who are given to Him and come from the Father. Nor was the Lord content to demonstrate the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Unity by His action in not rejecting those who are given to Him, nor seeking to do His own will instead of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him that sent Him, but when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, after the repetition of the words, <em>Him that sent Me</em>, began to murmur, He confirms our interpretation by saying, <em>Every one who hears from the Father and learns, comes unto Me. Not that any man has seen the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, save He which is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He has seen the Father. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Me has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life</em>.  Now, tell me first, where has the Father been heard, and where has He taught His hearers? No one has seen the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, save Him Who is from God: has any one ever heard Him Whom no one has ever seen? He that has heard from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, comes to the Son: and he that has heard the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, has heard the teaching of the Father's nature, for its properties are revealed in the Son. When, therefore, we hear the Son teaching, we must understand that we are hearing the teaching of the Father. No one has seen the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, yet he who comes to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, hears and learns from the Father to come: it is manifest, therefore, that the Father teaches through the words of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and, though seen of none, speaks to us in the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, by virtue of His perfect birth, possesses all the properties of His Father's nature. The Only-begotten God desiring, therefore, to testify of the Father's authority, yet inculcating His own unity with the Father's nature, does not cast out those who are given to Him of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or work His own will instead of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that sent Him: not that He does not will what He does, or is not Himself heard when He teaches; but in order that He may reveal Him Who sent Him, and Himself the Sent, under the aspect of one indistinguishable nature, He shows all that He wills, and says, and does, to be the will and works of the Father.</p>

<p>50. But He proves abundantly that His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is free by the words, <em>As the Father raises the dead and quickens them, even so the Son also quickens whom He will</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331043"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse21">John&nbsp;5:21</a></span> When the equality of Father and Son in power and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is indicated, then the freedom of the Son's will is made manifest: when Their unity is demonstrated, His conformity to the Father's will is signified, for what the Father wills, the Son does. But to do is something more than to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> a will: the latter would imply external necessity, while to do another's will requires unity with him, being an act of volition. In doing the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father the Son teaches that through the identity of Their nature His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the same in nature with the Father's, since all that He does is the Father's will. The Son plainly wills all that the Father wills, for wills of the same nature cannot dissent from one another. It is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father which is revealed in the words, <em>For this is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of My Father, that every one that beholds the Son and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Him, should have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and that I should raise Him up at the last day</em>.  Hear now, whether the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Son is discordant with the Father's, when He says, <em>Father, those whom You have given Me, I will that where I am they also may be with Me</em>.  Here is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the Son wills: for while the Father wills that those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Son should have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, the Son wills that the believer should be where He is. For is it not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life to dwell together with Christ? And does He not grant to the believer in Him all perfection of blessing when He says, <em>No one has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Son save the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, neither has any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Father save the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he to whomsoever the Son wills to reveal Him</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331046"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span>? Has He not freedom of will, when He wills to impart to us the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father's <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>? Is not His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> so free that He can bestow on whom He will the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself and His Father? Thus Father and Son are manifestly joint Possessors of a nature common to Both through birth and common through unity: for the Son is free of will, but what He does willingly is an act of the Father's will.</p>

<p>51. He who has not grasped the manifest truths of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, obviously cannot have an understanding of its <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>; because he has not the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> he is an alien to the hope of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. We must confess the Father to be in the Son and the Son in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by unity of nature, by might of power, as equal in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> as Begetter and Begotten. But, perhaps you say, the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of our Lord Himself is contrary to this declaration, for He says, <em>The Father is greater than I</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331047"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;14:28</a></span> Is this, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, the weapon of your profanity? Are these the arms of your frenzy? Has it escaped you, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not admit two Unbegotten, or confess two Fathers? Have you forgotten the Incarnation of the Mediator, with the birth, the cradle, the childhood, the passion, the cross and the death belonging to it? When you were born again, did you not confess the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, born of Mary? If the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, of Whom these things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, says, <em>The Father is greater than I</em>, can you be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that the Incarnation for your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was an emptying of the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, unaffected by this assumption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conditions, abode in the blessed <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of His own incorrupt nature without taking our flesh? We confess that the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while He abode in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, abode in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but we do not at once reabsorb into the substance of the divine unity His unity bearing the form of a servant. Nor do we teach that the Father is in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as if He entered into Him bodily; but that the nature which was begotten by the Father of the same kind as His own, possessed by nature the nature which begot it : and that this nature, abiding in the form of the nature which begot it, took the form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and weakness. Christ possessed all that was proper to His nature: but the form of God had departed from Him, for by emptying Himself of it, He had taken the form of a servant. The divine nature had not ceased to be, but still abiding in Him, it had taken upon itself the humility of earthly birth, and was exercising its proper power in the fashion of the humility it assumed. So <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being found as man in the form of a servant, but acting as God in His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, was at once God as His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, and yet man, for He was found in the fashion of man.</p>

<p>52. Therefore, in the discourse we have expounded above, He had borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the unity of His nature with the Father's: <em>He that has seen Me, has seen the Father also</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331049"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;14:9</a></span> <em>: The Father is in Me, and I in the Father</em>  These two passages perfectly agree, since Both Persons are of equal nature; to behold the Son is the same as to behold the Father; that the One abides in the One shows that They are inseparable. And, lest they should misunderstand Him, as though when they beheld His body, they beheld the Father in Him, He had added, <em>Believe Me, that I am in the Father and the Father in Me: or else <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me for the very works' sake</em>.  His power belonged to His nature, and His working was the exercise of that power; in the exercise of that power, then, they might recognise in Him the unity with the Father's nature. In proportion as any one recognised Him to be God in the power of His nature, he would come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, present in that mighty nature. The Son, Who is equal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, showed by His works that the Father could be seen in Him: in order that we, perceiving in the Son a nature like the Father's in its power, might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in Father and Son there is no distinction of nature.</p>

<p>53. So the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, just before He finished His work in the flesh, and completed the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of taking the servant's form, in order to establish our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, thus speaks, <em>You heard how I said unto you, I go away, and I came unto you. If you loved Me, you would <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, because I go unto the Father; for the Father is greater than I</em>.  He has already, in an earlier part of this very discourse unfolded in all its aspects the teaching of His divine nature: can we, then, on the strength of this confession deprive the Son of that equality, which His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth has perfected in Him? Or is it an indignity to the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the Unbegotten God is His Father, seeing that His Only-begotten birth from the Unbegotten gives Him the Only-begotten nature? He is not the source of His own being, nor did He, being Himself non-existent, bring to pass His own birth out of nothing; but, existing as a living nature and from a living nature, He possesses the power of that nature, and declares the authority of that nature, by bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and in His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> belonging to the birth He received. He pays to the Father the tribute of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him Who sent Him, but the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of humility does not dissolve the unity of His nature: He becomes <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> unto death, but, after death, He is above every name <span class="stiki" id="note331053"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;2:8-9</a></span> .</p>

<p>54. But if His equality is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> because the Name is given Him after He put off the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we dishonour Him by ignoring the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the humility which He assumed. The birth of His humanity brought to Him a new nature, and His form was changed in His humility, by the assumption of a servant's form, but now the giving of the Name restores to Him equality of form. Ask yourself what it is, which is given. If the gift be something pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the grant to the receiving nature does not impair the divinity of the giving nature. Again, the words, <em>And gave Him the Name, </em>involve a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> in the giving, but the giving of the Name does not make it another name. To Jesus is given, that to Him, <em>Every knee shall bow of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth, and every tongue confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father</em>.  The <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is given Him that He should be confessed in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. Do you hear Him say, <em>The Father is greater than I? </em>Know Him also, of Whom it is said in reward of His <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, <em>And gave unto Him the Name which is above every name</em> ; hear Him Who said, <em>I and the Father are one; He that has seen Me, has seen the Father also; I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in Me</em>. Consider the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the confession which is granted Him, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. When, then, is the Father greater than the Son? Surely, when He gives Him the Name above every name. And on the other hand, when is it that the Son and the Father are one? Surely, when every tongue confesses that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. If, then, the Father is greater through His authority to give, is the Son less through the confession of receiving? The Giver is greater: but the Receiver is not less, for to Him it is given to be one with the Giver. If it is not given to Jesus to be confessed in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He is less than the Father. But if it is given Him to be in that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in which the Father is, we see in the prerogative of giving, that the Giver is greater, and in the confession of the gift, that the Two are One. The Father is, therefore, greater than the Son: for manifestly He is greater, Who makes another to be all that He Himself is, Who imparts to the Son by the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the birth the image of His own unbegotten nature, Who begets Him from Himself into His own form, and restores Him again from the form of a servant to the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose work it is that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, born God according to the Spirit in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> dead in the flesh, should be once more God in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father. When, therefore, Christ says that He is going to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He reveals the reason why they should <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> if they loved Him, because the Father is greater than He.</p>

<p>55. After the explanation that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is the source of this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, because <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> rejoices that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is to be confessed in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He next expresses His claim to receive back that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in the words, <em>For the prince of this world comes, and he has nothing in Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331056"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;14:30</a></span> The prince of this world has nothing in Him: for being found in fashion as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He dwelt in the likeness of the flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet apart from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the flesh, and in the flesh condemned <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.  Then, giving <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the Father's command as His only motive, He adds, <em>But that the world may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, even as the Father gave Me commandment, so I do. Arise, let us go hence</em>.  In His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to do the Father's commandment, He rises and hastens to complete the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His bodily passion. But the next moment He unfolds the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His assumption of flesh. Through this assumption we are in Him, as the branches in the vinestock <span class="stiki" id="note331059"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;15:1-2</a></span>; and unless He had become the Vine, we could have borne no good fruit. He exhorts us to abide in Himself, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His assumed body, that, since the Word has been made flesh, we may be in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His flesh, as the branches are in the Vine. He separates the form of the Father's majesty from the humiliation of the assumed flesh by calling Himself the Vine, the source of unity for all the branches, and the Father the careful Husbandman, Who prunes away its useless and barren branches to be burnt in the fire. In the words, <em>He that has seen Me, has seen the Father also</em>, and <em>The words that I say unto you, I speak not of Myself, but the Father abiding in Me, He does His works, </em>and <em>Believe Me, that I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in Me</em>, He reveals the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His birth and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His Incarnation. He then continues the thread of His discourse, until He comes to the saying, <em>The Father is greater than I; </em>and after this, to complete the meaning of these words, He hastens to add the illustration of the husbandman, the vine, and the branches, which directs our notice to His submission to bodily humiliation. He says that, because the Father is greater than Himself, He is going to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> should <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, that He is going to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that is, to receive back His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from the Father: with Him, and in Him, to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> not with a brand-new <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, but with the old, not with some strange <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> but with that which He had with Him before. If then Christ shall not enter into Him with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, to abide in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you may disparage His nature: but if the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which He receives is the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His Godhead, recognise that it as Giver of this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the Father is the greater.</p>

<p>56. Why do you distort the Incarnation into a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>? Why pervert the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> into a weapon of destruction? The Father, Who glorifies the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, is greater: The Son, Who is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is not less. How can He be less, when He is in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father? And how can the Father not be greater? The Father therefore is greater, because He is Father: but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because He is Son, is not less. By the birth of the Son the Father is constituted greater: the nature that is His by birth, does not suffer the Son to be less. The Father is greater, for the Son <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> Him to render <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to manhood He has assumed. The Son is not less, for He receives back His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with the Father. Thus are consummated at once the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Birth, and the dispensation of the Incarnation. The Father, as Father, and as glorifying Him Who now is <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, is greater: Father and Son are one, in that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, born of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, after assuming an earthly body is taken back to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father.</p>

<p>57. The birth, therefore, does not constitute His nature inferior, for He is in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as being born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And though by their very signification, 'Unbegotten' and 'Begotten' seem to be opposed, yet the Begotten cannot be excluded from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Unbegotten, for there is none other from whom He could derive His substance. He does not indeed share in the supreme majesty of being unbegotten: but He has received from the Unbegotten God the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of divinity. Thus <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> confesses the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though it can give no meaning to begetting or beginning in His case. His nature forbids us to say that He ever began to be, for His birth lies beyond the beginnings of time. But while we confess Him existent before all ages, we do not hesitate to pronounce Him born in timeless <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, for we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> His birth, though we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it never had a beginning.</p>

<p>58. Seeking to disparage His nature, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> lay hold of such sayings as, <em>The Father is greater than I, </em>or, <em>But of that day and hour <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no one, not even the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in heaven, neither the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but the Father only</em>.  It is turned to a reproach against the Only-begotten God that He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the day and the hour: that, though <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He is not in the perfection of divine nature, since He is subjected to the limitation of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; that is, an external force stronger than Himself, triumphing, as it were, over His weakness, makes Him captive to this infirmity. And, indeed, it is with an apparent right to claim that this confession is inevitable, that the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, in their frenzy, would drive us to such a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> interpretation. The words are those of the Lord Himself, and what, it may be asked, could be more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> than to corrupt His express assertion by our attempt to explain it away.</p>

<p>59. But, before we investigate the meaning and occasion of these words, let us first appeal to the judgment of common sense. Is it credible, that He, Who stands to all things as the Author of their present and future, should not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things? If all things are through and in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and in such a way through Christ that they are also in Him, must not that, which is both in Him and through Him, be also in His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, when that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, by virtue of a nature which cannot be nescient, <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> apprehends what is neither in, nor through Him ? But that which derives from Him alone its origin, and has in Him alone the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its present state and future development, can that be beyond the ken of His nature, through which is effected, and in which is contained, all that it is and shall be? <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as it is now, stirred by present motives, and as it will be tomorrow, aroused by the impulse of future desires. Hear the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the Evangelist, <em>For Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> from the beginning who they were that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not, and who it was that should betray Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331062"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse64">John&nbsp;6:64</a></span> By its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> His nature could perceive the unborn future, and foresee the awakening of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> yet dormant in the mind: do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that it did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is through itself, and within itself? He is Lord of all that belongs to others, is He not Lord of His own? Remember what is written of Him, <em>All things have been created through Him, and in Him: and He is before all things</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331063"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse16">Colossians&nbsp;1:16</a></span>: or again, <em>For it was the good pleasure of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that in Him should all the fullness dwell, and through Him to reconcile all things unto Himself</em> , all fullness is in Him, all things were made through Him, and are reconciled in Him, and for that day of reconciliation we wait expectant; did He not, then, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, when its time was in His hands, and fixed by His <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, for it is the day of His coming, of which the Apostle wrote, <em>When Christ, Who is your life, shall be manifested, then shall you also with Him be manifested in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></em>.  No one is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of that which is through himself and within himself: shall Christ come, and does He not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the day of His coming? It is His day, for the same Apostle says, <em>The day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331066"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:2</a></span>: can we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, then, that He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it? Human natures, so far as in them lies, foresee what they determine to do: <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the end desired accompanies the desire to act: does not He Who is born <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is in, and through, Himself? The times are through Him, the day is in His hand, for the future is constituted through Him, and the Dispensation of His coming is in His power: is His understanding so dull, that the sense of His torpid nature does not tell Him what He has Himself determined? Is He like the brute and the beast, which, animated by no reason or foresight, not even conscious of acting but driven to and fro by the impulse of irrational desire, proceed to their end with fortuitous and uncertain course?</p>

<p>60. But, again, how can we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, because He was able not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the day of His own coming, was of a discordant and imperfect nature, subject to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of coming, but <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the day of His coming? This would make God weaker than the power of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, which took from Him the prerogative of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Then, too, how we redouble occasions of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, if we impute not only infirmity to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but also defect to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, saying that He defrauded of foreknowledge of this day the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Son of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> denied Him certainty concerning the future consummation: suffered Him to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the day and hour of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, but withheld from Him the day of His power, and the hour of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> among His Saints: took from Him the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His blessedness, while He granted Him prescience of His death? The trembling <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of man dare not presume to think thus of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or ascribe to Him such taint of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fickleness, that the Father should deny anything to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, Who was born as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, should possess an imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>61. But God can never be anything but <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, or anything but the Father: and He, Who loves, does not <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>; He Who is Father, is wholly and entirely Father. This name admits of no compromise: no one can be partly father, and partly not. A father is father in respect of his whole personality; all that he is is present in the child, for paternity by piecemeal is impossible: not that paternity extends to self-generation, but that a father is altogether father in all his qualities, to the offsprings born of him. According to the constitution of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies, which are made of dissimilar elements, and composed of various parts, the father must be father of the whole, since a perfect birth hands on to the child all the different elements and parts, which are in the father. The father is, therefore, father of all that is his; the birth proceeds from the whole of himself, and constitutes the whole of the child. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, has no body, but simple <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>: no parts, but an all-embracing whole: nothing quickened, but everything living. God is therefore all life, and all one, not compounded of parts, but perfect in His simplicity, and, as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, must be Father to His begotten in all that He Himself is, for the perfect birth of the Son makes Him perfect Father in all that He has. So, if He is proper Father to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the Son must possess all the properties of the Father. Yet how can this be, if the Son has not the quality of prescience, if there is anything from His Author, which is wanting in His birth? To say that there is one of God's properties which He has not, is almost equivalent to saying that He has none of them. And what is proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if not the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the future, a vision, which embraces the invisible and unborn world, and has within its scope that which is not yet, but is to be?</p>

<p>62. Moreover <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, forestalls the impious <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, that the Only-begotten God was partially nescient. Listen to his words, <em>Being instructed in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, unto all riches of the fullness of understanding, unto <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even Christ, in Whom are all the treasures of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> hidden</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331067"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse2">Colossians&nbsp;2:2-3</a></span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even Christ, is the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, and all the treasures of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are hidden in Him. But a portion is one thing, the whole another: a part is not the same as <em>all</em>, nor can <em>all </em>be called a part. If the Son does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the day, all the treasures of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are not in Him; but He has all the treasures of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in Him, therefore He is not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the day. But we must remember that those treasures of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> were <em>hidden </em>in Him, though not, because hidden, therefore wanting. As in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they are in Him: as in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, they are hidden. But Christ, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Whom are all the treasures of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> hidden, is not Himself hidden from our eyes and minds. Since then He is Himself the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, let us see whether He is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> when He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. If elsewhere His profession of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does not imply that He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, here also it will be wrong to call Him <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, if He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. In Him are hidden all the treasures of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and so His <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is an economy rather than <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Thus we can assign a reason for His <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, without the assumption that He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</p>

<p>63. Whenever God says that He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, He professes <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> indeed, but is not under the defect of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. It is not because of the infirmity of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but because it is not yet the time to speak, or the divine Plan to act. Thus He says to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <em>The cry of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> is full, and their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is very grievous. Therefore I will go down now, and see if they have done altogether according to the cry of it: and if not, I will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331068"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse20">Genesis&nbsp;18:20-21</a></span> Here we perceive God not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that which notwithstanding He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are very grievous, but He comes down again to see whether they have done altogether, and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> if they have not. We observe, then, that He is not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, although He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but that, when the time comes for action, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. This <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not, therefore, a change from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but the coming of the fullness of time. He waits still to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but we cannot suppose that He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: therefore His not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, is nothing else than a divine economy in word and deed.</p>

<p>64. We cannot, then, <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God depends on the occasion and not on any change on His part: by the occasion being meant the occasion, not of obtaining but of declaring <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as we learn from His words to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <em>Lay not your hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him, for now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you fear your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and hast not withheld your beloved son, for My sake</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331069"><a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse12">Genesis&nbsp;22:12</a></span> God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> now, but that <em>now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> </em>is a profession of previous <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>: yet it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that until now God did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, for it is written, <em><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it was counted to him for righteousness</em> , and therefore this <em>now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> </em>marks the time when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> received this testimony, not when God began to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of his son, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> he bore to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it at the time He spoke: but as we cannot suppose that He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> before, we must for this reason suppose that He took <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it then because He spoke.</p>

<p>By way of example, we have chosen for our consideration this passage out of many in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, which treat of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order to show that when God does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> lies, not in His <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but in the occasion.</p>

<p>65. We find our Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, yet not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, many things. Thus He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the workers of iniquity, who <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in their mighty works and in His name, for He says to them, <em>Then will <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, I never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you; depart from Me, all you that work iniquity</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331071"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;7:23</a></span> He declares with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> even, that He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, but nevertheless He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them to be workers of iniquity. He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, not because He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but because by the iniquity of their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> they are unworthy of His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and He even confirms His denial with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. By the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of His nature He could not be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> He refused to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Again the Unbegotten God does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the foolish <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>; He is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of those who were too careless to have their oil ready, when He entered the chamber of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> coming. They come and implore, and so far from not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> them, He cries, <em>Verily, I say unto you, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you not</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331072"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;25:12</a></span> Their coming and their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> compel Him to recognize them, but His profession of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> refers to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, not to His nature: they are unworthy to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of Him to Whom nothing is unknown. Hence, in order that we should not impute His <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to infirmity, He says immediately to the Apostles, <em>Watch therefore, for you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the day nor the hour</em>.  When He bids them watch, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the day or the hour, He points out that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, because through sleep and neglect they had no oil, and therefore were unworthy to enter into His chamber.</p>

<p>66. The Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, then, <em>Who searches the heart and the reins</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331074"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse23">Revelation&nbsp;2:23</a></span>, has no weakness in His nature, that He should not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, for, as we perceive, even the fact of His <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> proceeds from the omniscience of His nature. Yet if any there be, who impute to Him <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, let them tremble, lest He Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> their thoughts should say to them, <em>Wherefore think ye <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in your hearts</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331075"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;9:4</a></span> <em>? </em>The All-<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, though not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of thoughts and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, sometimes enquires as if He were, as for instance when He asks the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who it was that touched the hem of His garment, or the Apostles, why they quarrelled among themselves, or the mourners, where the sepulchre of Lazarus was: but His <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, except in words. It is against reason that He should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from afar the death and burial of Lazarus, but not the place of his sepulchre: that He should read the thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and not recognise the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: that He should not need to ask concerning anything , yet be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the dissension of the Apostles. But He, Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things, sometimes by a practice of economy professes <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, even though He is not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. Thus, in the case of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, God concealed His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> for a time: in that of the foolish <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and the workers of iniquity, He refused to recognise the unworthy: in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, His asking, as if <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, expressed His humanity. He accommodated Himself to the reality of His birth in the flesh in everything to which the weakness of our nature is subject, not in such wise that He became weak in His divine nature, but that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, born man, assumed the weaknesses of humanity, yet without thereby reducing His unchangeable nature to a weak nature, for the unchangeable nature was that wherein He mysteriously assumed flesh. He, Who was God is man, but, being man, has not ceased to remain God. Conducting Himself then as one born man, and proving Himself such, though remaining <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, He often uses the language of man (though <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, speaking as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, makes frequent use of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> terms), and does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that which it is not yet time to declare, or which is not deserving of His recognition.</p>

<p>67. We can now understand why He said that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the day. If we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to have been really <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, we contradict the Apostle, who says, <em>In Whom are all the treasures of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> hidden</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331077"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse3">Colossians&nbsp;2:3</a></span> There is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is hidden in Him, and because it has to be hidden, it must sometimes for this purpose be professed as <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, for once declared, it will no longer be secret. In order, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> may remain hidden, He declares that He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. But if He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, in order that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> may remain hidden, this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is not due to His nature, which is omniscient, for He is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> solely in order that it may be hidden. Nor is it hard to see why the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the day is hidden. He exhorts us to watch continually with unrelaxing <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and withholds from us the security of certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that our minds may be kept on the stretch by the uncertainty of suspense, and while they hasten towards and continually look for the day of His coming, may always watch in hope; and that, though we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the time must come, its very uncertainty may make us careful and vigilant. Thus the Lord says, <em>Therefore be ye also ready, for you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what hour the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> shall come</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331078"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;24:44</a></span>; and again, <em>Blessed is that servant whom His lord, when He comes, shall find so doing</em>.  The <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is, therefore, a means not to delude, but to encourage in perseverance. It is no loss to be denied a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which it is an advantage not to have, for the security of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> might breed negligence of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which now is concealed, while the uncertainty of expectation keeps us continually prepared, even as the master of the house, with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of loss before his eyes, watches and guards against the dreaded coming  of the thief, who chooses the time of sleep for his work.</p>

<p>68. Manifestly, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of God is not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> but a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>: in the economy of His actions and words and manifestations, He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and at the same time He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and at the same time does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. But we must ask, whether it may not be through the Son's infirmity that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. He could perhaps read the thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart, because His stronger nature can unite itself with a weaker in all its movements, and by the force of its power, as it were, pass through and through the feeble nature. But a weaker nature is powerless to penetrate a stronger: light things may be penetrated by heavy, rare by dense, liquid by solid, but the heavy are impenetrable to the light, the dense to the rare, and the solid to the liquid: the strong are not exposed to the weak, but the weak are penetrated by the strong. Therefore, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> say, the Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because, being Himself weak, He could not approach the more powerful and enter into Him, or pass through Him.</p>

<p>69. Should any one presume, not merely to speak thus of the Only-begotten God in the rashness of his tongue, but even to think so in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of his heart, let him hear what the Apostle thought of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, from the words he wrote to the Corinthians, <em>But unto us God revealed them through the Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yea the deep things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For who among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which are in him, save the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the things which are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, none <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, save the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331080"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:10-11</a></span> But let us cast aside these empty illustrations of material things, and measure God born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Spirit of Spirit, by His own powers and not by earthly conditions. Let us measure Him not by our own senses, but by His divine claims. Let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him Who said, <em>He that has seen Me has seen the Father also</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331081"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;14:9</a></span> Let us not forget that He said, <em>Believe, if only by My works, that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father</em> , and again, <em>I and the Father are one</em>.  If the names which correspond to realities, when intelligibly used, impart to us any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> information, then He Who is seen in Another by the eye of understanding is not different in nature from that Other; not different in kind, since He abides in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in Him; not separate, since Both are One. Perceive their unity in the indivisibility of their nature, and apprehend the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of that indivisible nature by regarding the One as the mirror of the Other. But remember that He is the mirror, not as the image reflected by the splendour of a nature outside Himself, but as being a living nature, indistinguishable from the Father's living nature, derived wholly from the whole of His Father's, having the Father's in Him because He is the Only begotten, and abiding in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>70. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> cannot deny that the Lord used these words to signify the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> His birth, but they attempt to escape from them by referring them to a harmony of will. They make the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and God the Son not one of divinity, but merely of will: as if the divine teaching were poor in expression and the Lord could not have said, <em>I and the Father are one in will</em>; or as if those words could have the same meaning as <em>I and the Father are one; </em>or as if He meant, <em>He that has seen My will, has seen the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of My Father also</em>, but, being unskilled statement, tried to express that idea in the words, <em>He that has seen Me has seen the Father also: </em>or as if the divine vocabulary did not contain the terms, <em>The will of My Father is in Me, and My will is in the Father</em>, but this thought could be expressed by <em>I in the Father and the Father in Me</em>. All this is nauseous and irreverent nonsense; common sense condemns the judgment of such silly fancies, as that the Lord could not say what He wanted, or did not say what He said. True, we find Him speaking in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and allegories, but it is a different thing to strengthen one's words with illustrations, or satisfy the dignity of the subject with the help of suggestive proverbs, or adapt one's language to the needs of the moment. But this passage concerning the unity, of which we are speaking, does not allow us to look for the meaning outside the plain sound of the words. If Father and Son are one, in the sense that They are one in will, and if separable natures cannot be one in will, because their diversity of kind and nature must draw them into diversities of will and judgment, how can They be one in will, not being one in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? There can be no unity of will between <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Omniscience and nescience are opposites, and opposites cannot be of the same will.</p>

<p>71. But perhaps it may be held to confirm the Son in His confession of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that He says the Father alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. But unless He had plainly said that the Father alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, it would have been a matter of the greatest danger for our understanding,  since we might have thought that He Himself did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. For, since His <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is due to the economy of hidden <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and not to a nature capable of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, now that He says the Father alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, we cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; for, as we said above, God's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not the discovery of what He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but its declaration. The fact that the Father alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, is no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the Son is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>: He says that He does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that others may not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: that the Father alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, to show that He Himself also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. If we say that God came to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> , when He ceased to conceal His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it follows that only because He did not conceal it from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, can the Father be said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the day, for God does not learn by sudden perception, but declares His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> with the occasion. If, then, the Son according to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the day, that He may not reveal it: on the other hand, only by the fact that He has revealed it can the Father be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the day.</p>

<p>72. Far be it from us to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> vicissitudes of bodily change in the Father and Son, as though the Father sometimes spoke to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and sometimes was silent. We remember, indeed, that a voice was sometimes uttered from heaven for us, that the power of the Father's words might confirm for us the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as the Lord says, <em>This voice has not come from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> for My sake but for your sakes</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331085"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;12:30</a></span> But the divine nature can dispense with the various combinations necessary for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> functions, the motion of the tongue, the adjustment of the mouth, the forcing of the breath, and the vibration of the air. God is a simple Being: we must understand Him by devotion, and confess Him by reverence. He is to be worshipped, not pursued by our senses, for a conditioned and weak nature cannot grasp with the guesses of its imagination the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> and <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> nature. In God is no variability, no parts, as of a composite divinity, that in Him will should follow inaction, speech silence, or work rest, or that He should not will, without passing from some other mental state to volition, or speak, without breaking the silence with His voice, or act, without going forth to labour. He is not subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature, for nature has received its law from Him: He never suffers weakness or change when He acts, for His power is boundless, as the Lord said, <em>Father, all things are possible unto You</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331086"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse36">Mark&nbsp;14:36</a></span> He can do more than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sense can conceive. The Lord does not deprive even Himself of the quality of omnipotence, for He says, <em>What things soever the Father does, these the Son also does in like manner</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331087"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;5:19</a></span> Nothing is difficult, when there is no weakness; for only a power which is weak to effect, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the need of effort. The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of difficulty is the weakness of the motive force; a force of limitless power rises above the conditions of impotence.</p>

<p>73. We have established this point to exclude the idea that after silence God spoke to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or after <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> the Son began to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. To reach our intelligence terms must be used applicable to our own nature: thus we do not understand communication except by word of mouth, or comprehend the opposite of nescience except as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Thus the Son does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the day for the reason that He does not reveal it: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He says, alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it for the reason that He reveals it to the Son alone. But, as we have said, Christ is conscious of no such natural impediments as an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which must be removed before He can come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is not His before the Father begins to speak. He declares the unity of His nature, as the only-begotten, with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by the unmistakable words, <em>All things whatsoever the Father has, are Mine</em>.  There is no mention here of coming into possession: it is one thing, to be the Possessor of things external to Him; another, to be self-contained and self-existent. The former is to possess heaven and earth and the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, the latter to be able to describe Himself by His own properties, which are His, not as something external and subject, but as something of which He Himself subsists. When He says, therefore, that all things which the Father has, are His, He alludes to the divine nature, and not to a joint ownership of gifts bestowed. For referring to His words that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> should take of His , He says, <em>All things whatsoever the Father has are Mine, therefore said I, He shall take of Mine: </em>that is, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> takes of His, but takes also of the Father's: and if He receives of the Father's, He receives also of His. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and does not receive of a creature, but teaches us that He receives all these gifts, because they are all God's. All things that belong to the Father are the Spirit's; but we must not think that whatever He received of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, He did not receive of the Father also; for all that the Father has belongs equally to the Son.</p>

<p>74. So the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Christ needed no change, or question, or answer, that it should advance from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or ask of One Who had continued in silence, and wait to receive His answer: but, abiding perfectly in <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> unity with Him, it received of God its whole being as it derived from Him its origin. And, further, it received all that belonged to the whole being of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely, His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. What the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, the Son does not learn by question and answer; what the Father wills, the Son does not will by command. Since all that the Father has, is His, it is the property of His nature to will and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, exactly as the Father wills and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. But to prove His birth He often expounds the doctrine of His Person, as when He says, <em>I came not to do My own will, but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that sent Me</em>.  He does the Father's will, not His own, and by <em>the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that sent Me</em>, He means His Father. But that He Himself wills the same, is unmistakeably declared in the words, <em>Father, those whom You have given Me, I will, that, where I am, they also may be with Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331091"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;17:24</a></span> The Father wills that we should be with Christ, in Whom, according to the Apostle, He chose us before the foundation of the world <span class="stiki" id="note331092"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse4">Ephesians&nbsp;1:4</a></span>, and the Son wills the same, namely that we should be with Him. His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is, therefore, the same in nature as the Father's will, though to make plain the fact of the birth it is distinguished from the Father's.</p>

<p>75. The Son is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, then, of nothing which the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, nor does it follow because the Father alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, that the Son does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Father and Son abide in unity of nature, and the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the Son belongs to the divine Plan of silence, seeing that in Him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. This the Lord Himself testified, when He answered the question of the Apostles concerning the times, <em>It is not yours to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> times or moments, which the Father has set within His own authority</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331093"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse7">Acts&nbsp;1:7</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is denied them, and not only that, but the anxiety to learn is forbidden, because it is not theirs to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these times. Yet now that He is risen, they ask again, though their question on the former occasion had been met with the reply, that not even the Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. They cannot possibly have understood literally that the Son did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, for they ask Him again as though He did <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. They perceived in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> a divine Plan of silence, and now, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, they renew the question, thinking that the time has come to speak. And the Son no longer denies that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, but tells them that it is not theirs to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, because the Father has set it within His own authority. If then, the Apostles attributed it to the divine Plan, and not to weakness, that the Son did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the day, shall we say that the Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the day for the simple reason that He was not God? Remember, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father set the day within His authority, that it might not come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, when asked before, replied that He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but now, no longer denying His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, replies that it is theirs not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, for the Father has set the times not in His own <em><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a></em>, but in His own <em>authority</em>. The day and the moment are included in the word 'times': can it be, then, that He, Who was to restore <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to its kingdom, did not Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the day and the moment of that restoration? He instructs us to see an evidence of His birth in this exclusive prerogative of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, yet He does not deny that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>: and while He proclaims that the possession of this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is withheld from ourselves, He asserts that it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Father's authority.</p>

<p> We must not therefore think, because He said He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the day and the moment, that the Son did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. As man He wept, and slept, and sorrowed, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is incapable of tears, or <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, or sleep. According to the weakness of His flesh He shed tears, slept, hungered, thirsted, was weary, and feared, yet without impairing the reality of His Only-begotten nature; equally so must we refer to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the words that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the day or the hour.</p>
