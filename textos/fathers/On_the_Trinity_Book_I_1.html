<h1>On the Trinity (Book I)</h1>

<div class="stiki"><p>Book I. The treatise begins with St. Hilary's own spiritual history, the events of which are displayed, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, more <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> and symmetrically in the narrative than they had occurred in the writer's experience. He tells of the efforts of a pure and noble <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, impeded, so far as we hear, neither by unworthy desires nor by indifference, to find an adequate end and aim of life. He rises first to the conception of the old <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and then by successive advances, as he learns more and more of the Divine revelation in Scripture, he attains the object of his search in the apprehension of God as revealed in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith. But this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is not the result of a mere intellectual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but of belief as well. In &sect;&sect; 1-14 we have this advance from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and peace. And here he might have rested, had he not been charged with the sacerdotal (i.e., in the language of that time, the episcopal) office, which laid upon him the duty of caring for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of others. And such care was needed, for (&sect;&sect; 15, 16) <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> were abroad, and chiefly two; the Sabellian which said that Father and Son were mere names or aspects of one Divine Person, and therefore there had been no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth of the Son; and the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> (which, however, Hilary rarely calls by the name of its advocate, preferring to style it the 'new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>') asserting more or less openly that the Son is created and not born, and therefore is different in kind from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and not, in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense, God. Hilary declares (&sect; 17) that his purpose is to refute these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and to demonstrate the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the evidence of Scripture. He demands from his hearers a loyal belief in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which he will cite; without such <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> his arguments will not profit them (&sect; 18); and in &sect; 19 he warns them of the limits of the argument from analogy, which he must employ, inadequate as it is in respect of the finite illustrations which he must use to express the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Then in &sect; 20 he speaks with a modest <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of his careful marshalling of the arguments which shall lead his readers to the right conclusion, and in &sect;&sect; 21-36 he gives a summary of the contents of the work. He concludes the first Book (&sect;&sect; 37, 38) with a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which expresses his certainty that what he holds is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and entreats the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> that he may have the eloquence of language and the cogency of reasoning needed for the worthy presentation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> concerning Them.</p></div>

<p>1. When I was seeking an employment adequate to the powers of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life and righteous in itself, whether prompted by nature or suggested by the researches of the wise, whereby I might attain to some result worthy of that Divine gift of understanding which has been given us, many things occurred to me which in general esteem were thought to render life both useful and desirable. And especially that which now, as always in the past, is regarded as most to be desired, leisure combined with <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, came before my mind. The one without the other seemed rather a source of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than an opportunity for good, for leisure in poverty is felt to be almost an exile from life itself, while <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> possessed amid anxiety is in itself an affliction, rendered the worse by the deeper humiliation which he must suffer who loses, after possessing, the things that most are wished and sought. And yet, though these two embrace the highest and best of the luxuries of life, they seem not far removed from the normal pleasures of the beasts which, as they roam through shady places rich in herbage, enjoy at once their safety from toil and the abundance of their food. For if this be regarded as the best and most perfect conduct of the life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it results that one object is common, though the range of feelings differ, to us and the whole unreasoning animal world, since all of them, in that bounteous provision and absolute leisure which nature bestows, have full scope for enjoyment without anxiety for possession.</p>

<p>2. I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the mass of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> have spurned from themselves and censured in others this acquiescence in a thoughtless, animal life, for no other reason than that nature herself has taught them that it is unworthy of humanity to hold themselves born only to gratify their greed and their sloth, and ushered into life for no high aim of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> deed or fair accomplishment, and that this very life was granted without the power of progress towards <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; a life, indeed, which then we should confidently assert did not deserve to be regarded as a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since, racked by pain and laden with trouble, it wastes itself upon itself from the blank mind of infancy to the wanderings of age. I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that men, prompted by nature herself, have raised themselves through teaching and practice to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which we name patience and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and forbearance, under the conviction that right living means right action and right thought, and that Immortal God has not given life only to end in death; for none can <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Giver of good has bestowed the pleasant sense of life in order that it may be overcast by the gloomy <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of dying.</p>

<p>3. And yet, though I could not tax with folly and uselessness this counsel of theirs to keep the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> free from blame, and evade by foresight or elude by skill or endure with patience the troubles of life, still I could not regard these men as guides competent to lead me to the good and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> Life. Their precepts were platitudes, on the mere level of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> impulse; animal instinct could not fail to comprehend them, and he who understood but disobeyed would have fallen into an insanity baser than animal unreason. Moreover, my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was eager not merely to do the things, neglect of which brings shame and suffering, but to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the God and Father Who had given this great gift, to Whom, it felt, it owed its whole self, Whose service was its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, on Whom all its hopes were fixed, in Whose lovingkindness, as in a safe home and haven, it could rest amid all the troubles of this anxious life. It was inflamed with a passionate desire to apprehend Him or to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him.</p>

<p>4. Some of these teachers brought forward large households of dubious deities, and under the persuasion that there is a sexual activity in divine beings narrated births and lineages from god to god. Others asserted that there were gods greater and less, of distinction proportionate  to their power. Some denied the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of any gods whatever, and confined their reverence to a nature which, in their opinion, owes its being to chance-led vibrations and collisions. On the other hand, many followed the common belief in asserting the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but proclaimed Him heedless and indifferent to the affairs of men. Again, some worshipped in the elements of earth and air the actual bodily and visible forms of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things; and, finally, some made their gods dwell within images of men or of beasts, tame or wild, of birds or of snakes, and confined the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> and Father of infinity within these narrow prisons of metal or stone or wood. These, I was sure, could be no exponents of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for though they were at one in the absurdity, the foulness, the impiety of their observances, they were at variance concerning the essential articles of their senseless belief. My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was distracted amid all these claims, yet still it pressed along that profitable road which leads inevitably to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It could not hold that neglect of a world created by Himself was worthily to be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that deities endowed with sex, and lines of begetters and begotten, were compatible with the pure and mighty nature of the Godhead. Nay, rather, it was sure that that which is Divine and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> must be one without distinction of sex, for that which is self-existent cannot have left outside itself anything superior to itself. Hence omnipotence and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> are the possession of One only, for omnipotence is incapable of degrees of strength or weakness, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of priority or succession. In God we must worship absolute <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and absolute power.</p>

<p>5. While my mind was dwelling on these and on many like thoughts, I chanced upon the books which, according to the tradition of the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, were written by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and found in these words spoken by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Creator testifying of Himself '<span class="sc">I Am that I Am</span>, and again, He that is <em>has sent me unto you</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330508"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;3:14</a></span>.' I confess that I was amazed to find in them an indication concerning God so exact that it expressed in the terms best adapted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> understanding an unattainable insight into the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Divine nature. For no property of God which the mind can grasp is more characteristic of Him than <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, since <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, in the absolute sense, cannot be predicated of that which shall come to an end, or of that which has had a beginning, and He who now joins continuity of being with the possession of perfect felicity could not in the past, nor can in the future, be non-existent; for whatsoever is Divine can neither be originated nor destroyed. Wherefore, since God's <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is inseparable from Himself, it was worthy of Him to reveal this one thing, that He is, as the assurance of His absolute <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.</p>

<p>6. For such an indication of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'s infinity the words '<span class="sc">I Am that I Am</span> ' were clearly adequate; but, in addition, we needed to apprehend the operation of His majesty and power. For while absolute <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is peculiar to Him Who, abiding <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, had no beginning in a past however remote, we hear again an utterance worthy of Himself issuing from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and Holy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who says, <em>Who holds the heaven in His palm and the earth in His hand</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330509"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;40:12</a></span>, and again, <em>The heaven is My throne and the earth is the footstool of My feet. What house will you build Me or what shall be the place of My rest</em>  <em>? </em>The whole heaven is held in the palm of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the whole earth grasped in His hand. Now the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, profitable as it is to the cursory thought of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, reveals a deeper meaning to the patient student than to the momentary hearer. For this heaven which is held in the palm of God is also His throne, and the earth which is grasped in His hand is also the footstool beneath His feet. This was not written that from throne and footstool, metaphors drawn from the posture of one sitting, we should conclude that He has extension in space, as of a body, for that which is His throne and footstool is also held in hand and palm by that <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> Omnipotence. It was written that in all born and <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things God might be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> within them and without, overshadowing and indwelling, surrounding all and interfused through all, since palm and hand, which hold, reveal the might of His external control, while throne and footstool, by their support of a sitter, display the subservience of outward things to One within Who, Himself outside them, encloses all in His grasp, yet dwells within the external world which is His own. In this wise does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from within and from without, control and correspond to the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; being <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> He is present in all things, in Him Who is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> all are included. In devout thoughts such as these my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, engrossed in the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, took its delight. For it seemed that the greatness of God so far surpassed the mental powers of His handiwork, that however far the limited mind of man might strain in the hazardous effort to define Him, the gap was not lessened between the finite nature which struggled and the boundless infinity that lay beyond its ken , I had come by reverent reflection on my own part to understand this, but I found it confirmed by the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <em>Whither shall I go from Your Spirit? Or whither shall I flee from Your face? If I ascend up into heaven, You are there; if I go down into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, You are there also; if I have taken my wings before dawn and made my dwelling in the uttermost parts of the sea (You are there). For there Your hand shall guide me and Your right hand shall hold me</em>.  There is no space where God is not; space does not exist apart from Him. He is in heaven, in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, beyond the seas; dwelling in all things and enveloping all. Thus He embraces, and is embraced by, the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, confined to no part of it but pervading all.</p>

<p>7. Therefore, although my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> drew <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> from the apprehension of this august and unfathomable Mind, because it could worship as its own Father and Creator so limitless an Infinity, yet with a still more eager desire it sought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> aspect of its <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Lord, that it might be able to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that that immeasurable Deity was apparelled in splendour befitting the beauty of His wisdom. Then, while the devout <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was baffled and astray through its own feebleness, it caught from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> voice this scale of comparison for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, admirably expressed, <em>By the greatness of His works and the beauty of the things that He has made the Creator of worlds is rightly discerned</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330513"><a href="../bible/wis013.htm#verse5">Wisdom&nbsp;13:5</a></span> The Creator of great things is supreme in greatness, of beautiful things in beauty. Since the work transcends our thoughts, all thought must be transcended by the Maker. Thus heaven and air and earth and seas are fair: fair also the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, as the Greeks agree, who from its beautiful ordering call it <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x1F79;&#x03C3;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>, that is, <em>order</em>. But if our thought can estimate this beauty of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> by a natural instinct&mdash; an instinct such as we see in certain birds and beasts whose voice, though it fall below the level of our understanding, yet has a sense clear to them though they cannot utter it, and in which, since all speech is the expression of some thought, there lies a meaning patent to themselves&mdash; must not the Lord of this universal beauty be recognised as Himself most beautiful amid all the beauty that surrounds Him? For though the splendour of His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> overtax our mind's best powers, it cannot fail to see that He is beautiful. We must in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> confess that God is most beautiful, and that with a beauty which, though it transcend our comprehension, forces itself upon our perception.</p>

<p>8. Thus my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, full of these results which by its own reflection and the teaching of Scripture it had attained, rested with assurance, as on some peaceful watchtower, upon that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> conclusion, recognising that its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature made it capable of one homage to its Creator, and of none other, whether greater or less; the homage namely of conviction that His is a greatness too vast for our comprehension but not for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For a reasonable <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is akin to reason and accepts its aid, even though that same reason cannot cope with the vastness of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Omnipotence.</p>

<p>9. Beneath all these thoughts lay an instinctive hope, which strengthened my assertion of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in some perfect blessedness hereafter to be earned by devout thoughts concerning God and upright life; the reward, as it were, that awaits the triumphant warrior. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in God would pass unrewarded, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be destroyed by death, and quenched in the extinction of bodily life. Even unaided reason pleaded that it was unworthy of God to usher man into an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> which has some share of His thought and wisdom, only to await the sentence of life withdrawn and of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death; to create him out of nothing to take his place in the World, only that when he has taken it he may perish. For, on the only rational theory of creation, its purpose was that things non-existent should come into being, not that things existing should cease to be.</p>

<p>10. Yet my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was weighed down with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> both for itself and for the body. It retained a firm conviction, and a devout loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but had come to harbour a deep anxiety concerning itself and the bodily dwelling which must, it thought, share its destruction. While in this state, in addition to its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the teaching of the Law and Prophets, it learned the truths taught by the Apostle in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>&mdash; <em>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All things were made through Him, and without Him was not anything made. That which was made in Him is life</em>  <em>, and the life was the light of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the light shines in darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not. There was a man sent from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose name was John. He came for <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that he might bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the light. That was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, which lightens every man that comes </em> <em>into this world. He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not. He came unto His own things, and they that were His own received Him not. But to as many as received Him He gave power to become sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His Name; which were born, not of blood, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as of the Only-begotten from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330515"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1-14</a></span> Here the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> makes an advance beyond the attainment of its natural capacities, is taught more than it had dreamed concerning God. For it learns that its Creator is God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; it hears that the Word is God and was with God in the beginning. It comes to understand that the Light of the world was abiding in the world and that the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not; that He came to His own possession and that they that were His own received Him not; but that they who do receive Him by virtue of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> advance to be sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being born not of the embrace of the flesh nor of the conception of the blood nor of bodily desire, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; finally, it learns that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and that His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was seen, which, as of the Only-begotten from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is perfect through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>11. Herein my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, trembling and distressed, found a hope wider than it had imagined. First came its introduction to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. Then it learned that the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and infinity and beauty which, by the light of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, it had attributed to its Creator belonged also to God the Only-begotten. It did not disperse its <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> among a plurality of deities, for it heard that He is God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor did it fall into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of attributing a difference of nature to this God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it learned that He is full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Nor yet did my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> perceive anything contrary to reason in God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He was revealed as having been in the beginning God with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It saw that there are very few who attain to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this saving <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, though its reward be great, for even His own received Him not though they who receive Him are promoted to be sons of God by a birth, not of the flesh but of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It learned also that this sonship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a compulsion but a possibility, for, while the Divine gift is offered to all, it is no heredity inevitably imprinted but a prize awarded to willing choice. And lest this very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that whosoever will may become a son of God should stagger the weakness of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (for most we desire, but least expect, that which from its very greatness we find it hard to hope for), <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> became flesh, that through His Incarnation our flesh might attain to union with <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>. And lest we should think that this incarnate Word was some other than <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, or that His flesh was of a body different from ours, He dwelt among us that by His dwelling He might be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the indwelling <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, by His dwelling among us, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as God incarnate in no other flesh than our own, and moreover, though He had condescended to take our flesh, not destitute of His own attributes; for He, the Only-begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is fully possessed of His own attributes and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> endowed with ours.</p>

<p>12. This lesson in the Divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> was gladly welcomed by my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, now drawing near through the flesh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, called to new birth through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, entrusted with liberty and power to win the heavenly regeneration, conscious of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of its Father and Creator, sure that He would not annihilate a creature whom He had summoned out of nothing into life. And it could estimate how high are these truths above the mental vision of man; for the reason which deals with the common objects of thought can conceive of nothing as existent beyond what it perceives within itself or can create out of itself. My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> measured the mighty workings of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wrought on the scale of His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> omnipotence, not by its own powers of perception but by a boundless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and therefore refused to disbelieve, because it could not understand, that God was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, but bore in mind the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that with the will to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> would come the power to understand.</p>

<p>13. And lest the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should stray and linger in some delusion of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, it receives this further lesson of perfect loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, taught by the Apostle in words inspired:&mdash; <em>Beware lest any man spoil you through <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain deceit, after the tradition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, after the rudiments of the word, and not after Christ; for in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you are made full in Him, Which is the Head of all principality and power; in Whom you were also <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> with a <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> not made with hands, in putting off the body, of the flesh, but with the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of Christ; buried with Him in Baptism, wherein also you have risen again through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the working of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who raised Him from the dead. And you, when you were dead in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and in the </em> <em>uncircumcision of your flesh, He has quickened with Him, having forgiven you all your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, blotting out the bond which was against us by its ordinances, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the Cross; and having put off the flesh He made a show of powers openly, triumphing over them through confidence in Himself</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330516"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse8">Colossians&nbsp;2:8-15</a></span> Steadfast <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> rejects the vain subtleties of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> enquiry; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> refuses to be vanquished by these treacherous devices of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> folly, and enslaved by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. It will not confine God within the limits which barred our common reason, nor judge <em>after the rudiments of the world</em> concerning Christ, <em>in Whom dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily</em>, and in such wise that the utmost efforts of the earthly mind to comprehend Him are baffled by that immeasurable Eternity and Omnipotence. My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> judged of Him as One Who, drawing us upward to partake of His own Divine nature, has loosened henceforth the bond of bodily observances Who, unlike the Symbolic Law, has initiated us into no <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of mutilating the flesh, but Whose purpose is that our spirit, <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, should purify all the natural faculties of the body by abstinence from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that we being buried with His Death in Baptism may return to the life of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> (since regeneration to life is death to the former life), and dying to our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be born again to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, that even as He abandoned His <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> to die for us, so should we awaken from death to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> with Him. For He took upon Him the flesh in which we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> that by wearing our flesh He might forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; a flesh which He shares with us by wearing it, not by sinning in it. He blotted out through death the sentence of death, that by a new creation of our race in Himself He might sweep away the penalty appointed by the former Law. He let them nail Him to the cross that He might nail to the curse of the cross and abolish all the curses to which the world is condemned. He suffered as man to the utmost that He might put powers to shame. For Scripture had foretold that He Who is God should die; that the victory and triumph of them that trust in Him lay in the fact that He, Who is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and cannot be overcome by death, was to die that mortals might gain <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. These <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wrought in a manner beyond our comprehension, cannot, I repeat, be understood by our natural faculties, for the work of the Infinite and Eternal can only be grasped by an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> intelligence. Hence, just as the truths that God became man, that the Immortal died that the Eternal was buried, do not belong to the rational order but are an unique work of power, so on the other hand it is an effect not of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> but of omnipotence that He Who is man is also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He Who died is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, that He Who was buried is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. We, then, are raised together by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Christ through His death. But, since in Christ there is the fullness of the Godhead, we have herein a revelation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father joining to raise us in Him Who died; and we must confess that Christ Jesus is none other than God in all the fullness of the Deity.</p>

<p>14. In this calm assurance of safety did my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> gladly and hopefully take its rest, and feared so little the interruption of death, that death seemed only a name for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. And the life of this present body was so far from seeming a burden or affliction that it was regarded as children regard their alphabet, sick men their draught, shipwrecked sailors their swim, young men the training for their profession, future commanders their first campaign; that is, as an endurable submission to present necessities, bearing the promise of a blissful <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. And further, I began to proclaim those truths in which my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had a personal <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as a duty of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> which had been laid upon me, employing my office to promote the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</p>

<p>15. While I was thus engaged there came to light certain fallacies of rash and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, hopeless for themselves and merciless towards others, who made their own feeble nature the measure of the might of God's nature. They claimed, not that they had ascended to an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> things, but that they had reduced all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, undefined before, within the scope of ordinary reason, and fixed the limits of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Whereas the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> work of religion is a service of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>; and these were men heedless of their own weakness, reckless of Divine realities, who undertook to improve upon the teaching of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>16. Not to touch upon the vain enquiries of other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>&mdash; concerning whom however, when the course of my argument gives occasion, I will not be silent&mdash; there are those who tamper with the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> by denying, under the cloak of loyalty to the One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the birth of God the Only-begotten. They assert that there was an extension of God into man, not a descent; that He, Who for the season that He took our flesh was <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, had not been previously, nor was then, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; that there was no Divine birth in His case, but an identity of Begetter and Begotten; and (to maintain what they consider a perfect loyalty to the unity of God) that there was an unbroken continuity in the Incarnation, the Father extending Himself into the Virgin, and Himself being born as His own Son. Others, on the contrary (<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, because there is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> apart from Christ, Who in the beginning was <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> with God), deny that He was born and declare that He was merely created. Birth, they hold, would confess Him to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while creation proves His Godhead unreal; and though this explanation be a fraud against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, regarded as an accurate definition, yet they think it may pass muster as figurative language. They degrade, in name and in belief, His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth to the level of a creation, to cut Him off from the Divine unity, that, as a creature called into being, He may not claim the fullness of the Godhead, which is not His by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth.</p>

<p>17. My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been burning to answer these insane attacks. I call to mind that the very centre of a saving <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the belief not merely in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in God as a Father; not merely in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but in Christ as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; in Him, not as a creature, but as God the Creator, born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. My prime object is by the clear assertions of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> to refute the insanity and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of men who use the unity of God (in itself a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and profitable confession) as a cloak for their denial either that in Christ God was born, or else that He is very God. Their purpose is to isolate a solitary God at the heart of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by making Christ, though mighty, only a creature; because, so they allege, a birth of God widens the believer's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> into a trust in more gods than one. But we, divinely taught to confess neither two Gods nor yet a solitary <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, will adduce the evidence of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> for our confession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, united, not confounded, in our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. We will not admit Their identity nor allow, as a compromise, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is God in some imperfect sense; for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot be the same as His Father, since He is His Son, nor yet can He be different in nature.</p>

<p>18. And you, whose warmth of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and passion for a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> unknown to the world and its <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> shall prompt to read me, must remember to eschew the feeble and baseless conjectures of earthly minds, and in devout willingness to learn must break down the barriers of prejudice and half-<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The new faculties of the regenerate <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are needed; each must have his understanding enlightened by the heavenly gift imparted to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. First he must take his stand upon the sure ground [<em>substantia </em>= <span class="greek">&#x1F51;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F71;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;</span>] of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Jeremiah says , that since he is to hear about that nature [substantia] he may expand his thoughts till they are worthy of the theme, not fixing some arbitrary standard for himself, but judging as of infinity. And again, though he be aware that he is partaker of the Divine nature, as the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> says in his second Epistle , yet he must not measure the Divine nature by the limitations of his own, but gauge God's assertions concerning Himself by the scale of His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> self-revelation. For he is the best student who does not read his thoughts into the book, but lets it reveal its own; who draws from it its sense, and does not import his own into it, nor force upon its words a meaning which he had determined was the right one before he opened its pages. Since then we are to discourse of the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let us assume that God has full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself, and bow with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> reverence to His words. For He Whom we can only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> through His own utterances is the fitting <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> concerning Himself.</p>

<p>19. If in our discussion of the nature and birth of God we adduce certain analogies, let no one suppose that such comparisons are perfect and complete. There can be no comparison between God and earthly things, yet the weakness of our understanding forces us to seek for illustrations from a lower sphere to explain our meaning about loftier themes. The course of daily life shows how our experience in ordinary matters enables us to form conclusions on unfamiliar subjects. We must therefore regard any comparison as helpful to man rather than as descriptive of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it suggests, rather than exhausts, the sense we seek. Nor let such a comparison be thought too bold when it sets side by side carnal and spiritual natures, things invisible and things palpable, since it avows itself a necessary aid to the weakness of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and deprecates the condemnation due to an imperfect analogy. On this principle I proceed with my task, intending to use the terms supplied by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet colouring my argument with illustrations drawn from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life.</p>

<p>20. And first, I have so laid out the plan of the whole work as to consult the advantage of the reader by the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> order in which its books are arranged. It has been my resolve to publish no half-finished and ill-considered treatise, lest its disorderly array should resemble the confused clamour of a mob of peasants. And since no one can scale a precipice unless there be jutting ledges to aid his progress to the summit, I have here set down in order the primary outlines of our ascent leading our difficult course of argument up the easiest path; not cutting steps in the face of the rock, but levelling it to a gentle slope, that so the traveller, almost without a sense of effort may reach the heights.</p>

<p>21. Thus, after the present first book, the second expounds the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Divine birth, that those who shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Names, and not be perplexed about their sense but accurately informed as to fact and meaning, and so receive full assurance that in the words which are used they have the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Names, and that those Names involve the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>22. After this short and simple discourse concerning the Trinity, the third book makes further progress, sure though slow. Citing the greatest instances of His power, it brings within the range of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith's</a> understanding that saying, in itself beyond our comprehension, <em>I in the Father and the Father in Me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330519"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;10:38</a></span>, which Christ utters concerning Himself. Thus <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> beyond the dull wit of man is the prize of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> equipped with reason and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for neither may we <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> God's Word concerning Himself, nor can we suppose that the devout reason is incapable of apprehending His might.</p>

<p>23. The fourth book starts with the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and disowns complicity in the fallacies whereby they are traducing the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It publishes that <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a> creed which a number of them have lately promulgated , and exposes the dishonesty, and therefore the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, of their arguments from the Law for what they call the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It sets out the whole evidence of Law and Prophets to demonstrate the impiety of asserting the unity of God to the exclusion of the Godhead of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the treason of alleging that if Christ be God the Only-begotten, then God is not one.</p>

<p>24. The fifth book follows in reply the sequence of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> assertion. They had <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> declared that they followed the law in the sense which they assigned to the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that they had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from it that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God is of one Person; and this in order to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">rob</a> the Lord Christ of His birth by their conclusion concerning the One <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for birth is the evidence of origin. In answer I assert, step by step, what they deny; for from the Law and the Prophets I demonstrate that there are not two gods, nor one isolated <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither perverting the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Divine unity nor denying the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And since they say that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, created rather than born, bears the Divine Name by gift and not by right, I have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity from the Prophets in such a way that, He being acknowledged very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the assurance of His inherent Godhead shall hold us fast to the certainty that God is One.</p>

<p>25. The sixth book reveals the full deceitfulness of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teaching. To win credit for their assertions they denounce the impious doctrine of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>:&mdash; of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, to wit, and Sabellius and Manich&aelig;us and Hieracas, and appropriate the godly language of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a cover for their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. They reprove and alter the language of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, correcting it into a vague resemblance to <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, in order to suppress the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> while apparently denouncing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. But we state clearly what is the language and what the doctrine of each of these men, and acquit the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of any complicity or fellowship with condemned <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Their words which deserve condemnation we condemn, and those which claim our <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> acceptance we accept. Thus that Divine Sonship of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, which is the object of their most strenuous denial, we prove by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by Christ's own assertion, by the preaching of Apostles, by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, by the cries of devils, by the contradiction of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, in itself a confession, by the recognition of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> who had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and all this to rescue from dispute a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of which Christ had left us no excuse for <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.</p>

<p>26. Next the seventh book, starting from the basis of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> now attained, delivers its verdict in the great debate. First, armed with its sound and incontrovertible <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the impregnable <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it takes part in the conflict raging between Sabellius and Hebion and these opponents of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead. It joins issue with Sabellius on his denial of the pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and with his assailants on their assertion that He is a creature. Sabellius overlooked the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God worked in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body. Our present adversaries deny that He was born, assert that He was created, and fail to see in His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> the works of very God. What both sides dispute, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Sabellius denies that it was the Son who was working, and he is wrong; but he proves his case triumphantly when he alleges that the work done was that of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. The Church shares his victory over those who deny that in Christ was very God. But when Sabellius denies that Christ <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the worlds, his adversaries prove to conviction that Christ's activity is from everlasting, and we are on their side in this confutation of Sabellius, who recognises <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in this activity. And our two previous adversaries join forces to refute Hebion, the second demonstrating the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while the first proves that His work is that of very God. Thus the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> overthrow one another, while the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as against Sabellius, against those who call Christ a creature, against Hebion, bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> is very God of very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, born before the worlds and born in after times as man.</p>

<p>27. No one can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that we have taken the course of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reverence and of sound doctrine when, after proving from Law and Prophets first that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and next that He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this without breach of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> unity, we proceed to support the Law and the Prophets by the evidence of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, and prove from them also that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and Himself very God. It is the easiest of tasks, after demonstrating His right to the Name of Son, to show that the Name <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> describes His relation to the Father; though indeed universal usage regards the granting of the name of son as convincing evidence of sonship. But, to leave no loophole for the trickery and deceit of these traducers of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth of God the Only-begotten, we have used His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead as evidence of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Sonship; to show that He Who (as is confessed by all) bears the Name of <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is actually <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we have adduced His Name, His birth, His nature, His power, His assertions. We have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that His Name is an accurate description of Himself, that the title of Son is an evidence of birth, that in His birth He retained His Divine Nature, and with His nature His power, and that that power manifested itself in conscious and deliberate self-revelation. I have set down the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of each several point, showing how His self-revelation displays His power, how His power reveals His nature, how His nature is His by birthright, and from His birth comes His title to the name of Son. Thus every whisper of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is silenced, for the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of His own mouth has taught us that He is, as His Name, His birth, His nature, His power declare, in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense of Deity, very God of very God.</p>

<p>28. While its two predecessors have been devoted to the confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Christ as <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the eighth book is taken up with the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, showing that this unity is consistent with the birth of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and that the birth involves no duality in the Godhead. First it exposes the sophistry with which these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have attempted to avoid, though they could not deny, the confession of the real <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Father and Son; it demolishes their helpless and absurd plea that in such passages as, <em>And the multitude of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> were one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and heart</em> , and again, <em>He that plants and He that waters are one</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330522"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:8</a></span>, and <em>Neither for these only do I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, but for them also that shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Me through their word, that they may all be one, even as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in You, that they also may be in Us</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330523"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse20">John&nbsp;17:20-21</a></span>, a unity of will and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, not of Divinity, is expressed. From a consideration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense of these texts we show that they involve the reality of the Divine birth; and then, displaying the whole series of our Lord's self-revelations, we exhibit, in the language of Apostles and in the very words of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the whole and perfect <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God as Father and as Only-begotten Son. Because there is a Father we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is a Son; in that Son the Father is manifested to us, and hence our certainty that He is born the Only-begotten and that He is very God.</p>

<p>29. In matters essential to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> it is not enough to advance the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> supplies and finds sufficient. Arguments which we have not tested may delude us into a misapprehension of the meaning of our own words, unless we take the offensive by exposing the hollowness of the enemy's <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, and so establish our own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> upon the demonstrated absurdity of his. The ninth book, therefore, is employed in refuting the arguments by which the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> attempt to invalidate the birth of God the Only-begotten;&mdash; <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who ignore the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the revelation hidden from the beginning of the world, and forget that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> proclaims the union of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For their denial that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, like God and equal with God as Son with Father, born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and by right of His birth subsisting as very Spirit, they are accustomed to appeal to such words of our Lord as, <em>Why do you call Me good? None is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> save One, even God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330524"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;18:19</a></span> They argue that by His reproof of the man who called Him good, and by His assertion of the goodness of God only, He excludes Himself from the goodness of that God Who alone is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and from that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity which belongs only to One. With this text their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> reasoning connects another, <em>And this is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> that they should </em> <em><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him Whom You sent, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330525"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;17:3</a></span> Here, they say, He confesses that the Father is the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that He Himself is neither <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nor <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since this recognition of an only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God is limited to the Possessor of the attributes assigned. And they profess to be quite clear about His meaning in this passage, since He also says, <em>The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He has seen the Father doing</em>.  The fact that He can only copy is said to be evidence of the limitation of His nature. There can be no comparison between Omnipotence and One whose action is dependent upon the previous activity of Another; reason itself draws an absolute line between power and the want of power. That line is so clear that He Himself has avowed concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <em>The Father is greater than I</em>.  So frank a confession silences all demur; it is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> to assign the dignity and nature of God to One who disclaims them. So utterly devoid is He of the qualities of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God that He actually bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> concerning Himself, <em>But of that day and hour <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no one, neither the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in heaven nor the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330528"><a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse32">Mark&nbsp;13:32</a></span> A son who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not his father's secret must, from his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, be alien from the father who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; a nature limited in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> cannot partake of that majesty and might which alone is exempt from the tyranny of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.</p>

<p>30. We therefore expose the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> misunderstanding at which they have arrived by distortion and perversion of the meaning of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words. We account for those words by stating what manner of questions He was answering, at what times He was speaking, what partial <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> He was deigning to impart; we make the circumstances explain the words, and do not force the former into consistency with the latter. Thus each case of variance, that for instance between <em>The Father is greater than I</em> , and <em>I and the Father are One</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330530"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span>, or between <em>None is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> save One, even God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330531"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;18:19</a></span>, and <em>He that has seen Me has seen the Father also</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330532"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;14:9</a></span>, or a difference so wide as that between <em>Father, all things that are Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine</em> , and <em>That they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em> , or between <em>I in the Father and the Father in Me</em> , and <em>But of the day and hour <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no one, neither the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in heaven nor the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but the Father only</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330536"><a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse32">Mark&nbsp;13:32</a></span>, is explained by a discrimination between gradual revelation and full expression of His nature and power. Both are utterances of the same Speaker, and an exposition of the real force of each group will show that Christ's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead is no whit impaired because, to form the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the birth and Name  of Christ were revealed gradually, and under conditions which He chose of occasion and time.</p>

<p>31. The purpose of the tenth book is one in harmony with the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For since, in the folly which passes with them for wisdom, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have twisted some of the circumstances and utterances of the Passion into an insolent contradiction of the Divine nature and power of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, I am compelled to prove that this is a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> misinterpretation, and that these things were put on record by the Lord Himself as evidences of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and absolute majesty. In their parody of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they deceive themselves with words such as, <em>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sorrowful even unto death</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330538"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;26:38</a></span> He, they think, must be far removed from the blissful and passionless life of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, over Whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> brooded this crushing <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of an impending woe, Who under the pressure of suffering even humbled Himself to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, <em>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from Me</em> , and assuredly bore the appearance of fearing to endure the trials from which He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for release; Whose whole nature was so overwhelmed by agony that in those moments on the Cross He cried, <em>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have You forsaken Me</em> ? Forced by the bitterness of His pain to complain that He was forsaken: Who, destitute of the Father's help, gave up the ghost with the words, <em>Father, into Your hands I commend My Spirit</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330541"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;23:46</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, they say, which beset Him at the moment of expiring made Him entrust His Spirit to the care of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father: the very hopelessness of His own condition forced Him to commit His Soul to the keeping of Another.</p>

<p>32. Their folly being as great as their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, they fail to mark that Christ's words, spoken under similar circumstances, are always consistent; they cleave to the letter and ignore the purpose of His words. There is the widest difference between <em>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sorrowful even unto death</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330542"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;26:38</a></span>, and <em>Henceforth you shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> sitting at the right hand of power</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330543"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse64">Matthew&nbsp;26:64</a></span>; so also between <em>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away, from Me</em> , and <em>The cup which the Father has given Me, shall </em> <em>I not drink it</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330545"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;18:11</a></span> <em>? </em>and further between <em>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have You forsaken Me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330546"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;27:46</a></span> <em>? </em>and <em>Verily I say unto you, Today shall you be with Me in Paradise</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330547"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;23:43</a></span>, and between <em>Father, into Your hands I commend My Spirit</em> , and <em>Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do</em>  <em>; </em>and their narrow minds, unable to grasp the Divine meaning, plunge into <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> in the attempt at explanation. There is a broad distinction between anxiety and a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> at ease, between haste and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for delay, between words of anguish and words of encouragement, between despair for self and confident entreaty for others; and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> display their impiety by ignoring the assertions of Deity and the Divine nature of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which account for the one class of His words, while they concentrate their attention upon the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and words which refer only to His ministry on earth. I have therefore set out all the elements contained in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Soul and Body of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>; all have been sought out, none suppressed. Next, casting the calm light of reason upon the question, I have referred each of His sayings to the class to which its meaning attaches it, and so have shown that He had also a confidence which never wavered, a will which never faltered, an assurance which never murmured, that, when He commended His own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in this was involved a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the pardon of others.  Thus a complete presentment of the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> interprets and confirms all (and not some only) of the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>33. And so&mdash; for not even the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Resurrection has opened the eyes of these lost men and kept them within the manifest bounds of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash; they have forged a weapon for their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> out of a pretended reverence, and even perverted the revelation of a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> into an insult to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. From the words, <em>I ascend unto My Father and your Father, to My God and your God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330551"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;20:17</a></span>, they argue that since that Father is ours as much as His, and that God also ours and His, His own confession that He shares with us in that relation to the Father and to God excludes Him from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity, and subordinates Him to God the Creator Whose creature and inferior He is, as we are, although He has received the adoption of a Son. Nay more, we must not suppose that He possesses any of the characters of the Divine nature, since the Apostle says, <em>But when He says, all things are put in subjection, this is except Him Who did subject all things unto Him, for when all things shall have been subjected unto Him, then shall also He Himself be subjected to Him that did subject all things unto Him, that God may be all in all</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330552"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:27-28</a></span> For, so they say, subjection is evidence of want of power in the subject and of its possession by the sovereign. The eleventh book is employed in a reverent discussion of this argument; it proves from these very words of the Apostle not only that subjection is no evidence of want of power in Christ but that it actually is a sign of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity as God the Son; that the fact that His Father and God is also our Father and God is an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> advantage to us and no degradation to Him, since He Who has been born as Man and suffered all the afflictions of our flesh has gone up on high to our God and Father, to receive His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as Man our Representative.</p>

<p>34. In this treatise we have followed the course which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is pursued in every branch of education. First come easy lessons and a familiarity, slowly attained by practice, with the groundwork of the subject; then the student may make <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, in the business of life, of the training which he has received. Thus the soldier, when he is perfect in his exercises, can go out to battle; the advocate ventures into the conflicts of the courts when he is versed in the pleadings of the school of rhetoric; the sailor who has learned to navigate his ship in the land-locked harbour of his home may be trusted amid the storms of open seas and distant climes. Such has been our proceeding in this most serious and difficult science in which the whole <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is taught. First came simple instruction for the untaught believer in the birth, the name, the Divinity, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity of Christ; since then we have quietly and steadily advanced till our readers can demolish every plea of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; and now at last we have pitted them against the adversary in the present great and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> conflict. The mind of men is powerless with the ordinary resources of unaided reason to grasp the idea of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> birth, but they attain by study of things Divine to the apprehension of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> which lie beyond the range of common thought. They can explode that paradox concerning the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, which derives all its strength and semblance of cogency from a purblind pagan <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>: the paradox which asserts, <em>There was a time when He was not</em>, and <em>He was not before He was born, and He was made out of </em> <em>nothing</em>; as though His birth were <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that He had previously been non-existent and at a given moment came into being, and God the Only-begotten could thus be subjected to the conception of time, as if the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself [by conferring the title of 'Son'] and the very nature of birth <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that there was a time when He was not. Accordingly they argue that He was born out of nothing, on the ground that birth implies the grant of being to that which previously had no being. We proclaim in answer, on the evidence of Apostles and Evangelists, that the Father is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and the Son <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and demonstrate that the Son is God of all with an absolute, not a limited, pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; that these bold assaults of their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> logic&mdash; <em>He was born out of nothing</em>, and <em>He was not before He was born</em>&mdash; are powerless against Him; that His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is consistent with sonship, and His sonship with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; that there was in Him no unique exemption from birth but a birth from everlasting, for, while birth implies a Father, Divinity is inseparable from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.</p>

<p>35. Ignorance of prophetic diction and unskilfulness in interpreting Scripture has led them into a perversion of the point and meaning of the passage, <em>The Lord created Me for a beginning of His ways for His works</em>.  They labour to establish from it that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is created, rather than born, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and hence partakes the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of created beings, though He excel them in the manner of His creation, and has no <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Divine birth but only the powers of a transcendent creature. We in reply, without importing any new considerations or preconceived opinions, will make this very passage of Wisdom  display its own <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning and object. We will show that the fact that He was created for the beginning of the ways of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and for His works, cannot be twisted into evidence concerning the Divine and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> birth, because creation for these purposes and birth from everlasting are two entirely different things. Where birth is meant, there birth, and nothing but birth, is spoken of; where creation is mentioned, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that creation is first named. There is a Wisdom born before all things, and again there is a wisdom created for particular purposes; the Wisdom which is from everlasting is one, the wisdom which has come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> during the lapse of time is another.</p>

<p>36. Having thus concluded that we must reject the word 'creation' from our confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in God the Only-begotten, we proceed to lay down the teachings of reason and of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, that the reader, whose convictions have been established by patient and earnest study of the preceding books, may be provided with a complete presentation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. This end will be attained when the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teaching on this theme also have been swept away, and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, pure and undefiled, of the Trinity which regenerates us has been fixed in terms of saving precision on the authority of Apostles and Evangelists. Men will no longer dare, on the strength of mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasoning, to rank among creatures that Divine Spirit, Whom we receive as the pledge of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and source of fellowship with the sinless nature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>37. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O Lord God Almighty, that I owe You, as the chief duty of my life, the devotion of all my words and thoughts to Yourself. The gift of speech which You have bestowed can bring me no higher reward than the opportunity of service in preaching You and displaying You as You are, as Father and Father of God the Only-begotten, to the world in its blindness and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> in his rebellion. But this is the mere expression of my own desire; I must <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> also for the gift of Your help and compassion, that the breath of Your Spirit may fill the sails of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and confession which I have spread, and a favouring wind be sent to forward me on my voyage of instruction. We can trust the promise of Him Who said, <em>Ask, and it shall be given you, seek, and you shall find, knock, and it shall be opened unto you</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330555"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;11:9</a></span>; and we in our want shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the things we need. We shall bring an untiring energy to the study of Your Prophets and Apostles, and we shall knock for entrance at every gate of hidden <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but it is Yours to answer the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, to grant the thing we seek, to open the door on which we beat. Our minds are born with dull and clouded vision, our feeble <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is penned within the barriers of an impassable <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> concerning things Divine; but the study of Your revelation elevates our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the comprehension of sacred <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and submission to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the path to a certainty beyond the reach of unassisted reason.</p>

<p>38. And therefore we look to Your support for the first trembling steps of this undertaking, to Your aid that it may gain strength and prosper. We look to You to give us the fellowship of that Spirit Who guided the Prophets and the Apostles, that we may take their words in the sense in which they spoke and assign its right shade of meaning to every utterance. For we shall speak of things which they preached in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>; of You, O God Eternal, Father of the Eternal and Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who alone art without birth, and of the One Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, born of You from everlasting. We may not sever Him from You, or make Him one of a plurality of Gods, on any plea of difference of nature. We may not say that He is not begotten of You, because You are One. We must not fail to confess Him as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeing that He is born of You, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, His Father. Grant us, therefore, precision of language, soundness of argument, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of style, loyalty to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Enable us to utter the things that we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that so we may confess, as Prophets and Apostles have taught us, You, One God our Father, and One Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and put to silence the gainsaying of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, proclaiming You as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet not solitary, and Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in no unreal sense.</p>
