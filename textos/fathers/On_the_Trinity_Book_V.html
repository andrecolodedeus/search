<h1>On the Trinity (Book V)</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">Proceeds to treat of the arguments put forward by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, not from Scripture, but from their own reason. Those are refuted, who think the substance of the Father and of the Son to be not the same, because everything predicated of God is, in their opinion, predicated of Him according to substance; and therefore it follows, that to beget and to be begotten, or to be begotten and unbegotten, being diverse, are diverse substances; whereas it is here demonstrated that not everything predicated of God is predicated according to substance, in such manner as He is called good and great according to substance, or anything else that is predicated of Him in respect to Himself; but that some things are also predicated of Him relatively, i.e. not in respect to Himself, but to something not Himself, as He is called Father in respect to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and Lord in respect to the creature that serves Him; in which case, if anything thus predicated relatively, i.e. in respect to something not Himself, is even predicated as happening in time, as e.g. <q>Lord, you have become our refuge,</q> yet nothing happens to God so as to work a change in Him, but He Himself remains absolutely unchangeable in His own nature or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.</span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; What the Author Entreats from God, What from the Reader. In God Nothing is to Be Thought Corporeal or Changeable.</h2>

<p>1. Beginning, as I now do henceforward, to speak of subjects which cannot altogether be spoken as they are thought, either by any man, or, at any rate, not by myself; although even our very thought, when we think of God the Trinity, falls (as we feel) very far short of Him of whom we think, nor comprehends Him as He is; but He is seen, as it is written, even by those who are so great as was the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, <q>through a glass and in an enigma:</q>  first, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to our Lord God Himself, of whom we ought always to think, and of whom we are not able to think worthily, in praise of whom blessing is at all times to be rendered,  and whom no speech is sufficient to declare, that He will grant me both help for understanding and explaining that which I design, and pardon if in anything I offend. For I bear in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, not only my desire, but also my infirmity. I ask also of my readers to pardon me, where they may perceive me to have had the desire rather than the power to speak, what they either understand better themselves, or fail to understand through the obscurity of my language, just as I myself pardon them what they cannot understand through their own dullness.</p>

<p>2. And we shall mutually pardon one another the more easily, if we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, or at any rate firmly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and hold, that whatever is said of a nature, unchangeable, invisible and having life absolutely and sufficient to itself, must not be measured after the custom of things visible, and changeable, and mortal, or not self-sufficient. But although we labor, and yet fail, to grasp and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even those things which are within the scope of our corporeal senses, or what we are ourselves in the inner man; yet it is with no shamelessness that faithful <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> burns after those divine and unspeakable things which are above: <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, I say, not inflated by the arrogance of its own power, but inflamed by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of its Creator and Saviour Himself. For with what understanding can man apprehend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who does not yet apprehend that very understanding itself of his own, by which he desires to apprehend Him? And if he does already apprehend this, let him carefully consider that there is nothing in his own nature better than it; and let him see whether he can there see any outlines of forms, or brightness of colors, or greatness of space, or distance of parts, or extension of size, or any movements through intervals of place, or any such thing at all. Certainly we find nothing of all this in that, than which we find nothing better in our own nature, that is, in our own <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, by which we apprehend wisdom according to our capacity. What, therefore, we do not find in that which is our own best, we ought not to seek in Him who is far better than that best of ours; that so we may understand <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if we are able, and as much as we are able, as good without quality, great without quantity, a creator though He lack nothing, ruling but from no position, sustaining all things without <q>having</q> them, in His wholeness everywhere, yet without place, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> without time, making things that are changeable, without change of Himself, and without passion. Whoso thus thinks of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although he cannot yet find out in all ways what He is, yet piously takes heed, as much as he is able, to think nothing of Him that He is not.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; God the Only Unchangeable Essence.</h2>

<p>3. He is, however, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, a substance, or, if it be better so to call it, an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which the Greeks call <span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span> . For as wisdom is so called from the being wise, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>; so from being  comes that which we call <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. And who is there that is, more than He who said to His servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>I am that I am;</q> and, <q>Thus shall you say unto the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, He who is has sent me unto you?</q>  But other things that are called essences or substances admit of accidents, whereby a change, whether great or small, is produced in them. But there can be no accident of this kind in respect to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and therefore He who is God is the only unchangeable substance or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, to whom certainly being itself, whence comes the name of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, most especially and most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> belongs. For that which is changed does not retain its own being; and that which can be changed, although it be not actually changed, is able not to be that which it had been; and hence that which not only is not changed, but also cannot at all be changed, alone falls most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, without difficulty or hesitation, under the category of being .</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; The Argument of the Arians is Refuted, Which is Drawn from the Words Begotten and Unbegotten.</h2>

<p>4. Wherefore&mdash;to being now to answer the adversaries of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, respecting those things also, which are neither said as they are thought, nor thought as they really are:&mdash; among the many things which the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> are wont to dispute against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they seem chiefly to set forth this, as their most crafty device, namely, that whatsoever is said or understood of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is said not according to accident, but according to substance, and therefore, to be unbegotten belongs to the Father according to substance, and to be begotten belongs to the Son according to substance; but to be unbegotten and to be begotten are different; therefore the substance of the Father and that of the Son are different. To whom we reply, If whatever is spoken of God is spoken according to substance, then that which is said, <q>I and the Father are one,</q>  is spoken according to substance. Therefore there is one substance of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Or if this is not said according to substance, then something is said of God not according to substance, and therefore we are no longer compelled to understand unbegotten and begotten according to substance. It is also said of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <q>He thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  We ask, equal according to what? For if He is not said to be equal according to substance, then they admit that something may be said of God not according to substance. Let them admit, then, that unbegotten and begotten are not spoken according to substance. And if they do not admit this, on the ground that they will have all things to be spoken of God according to substance, then the Son is equal to the Father according to substance.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; The Accidental Always Implies Some Change in the Thing.</h2>

<p>5. That which is accidental commonly implies that it can be lost by some change of the thing to which it is an accident. For although some accidents are said to be inseparable, which in Greek are called <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C7;&#x1F7D;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span>, as the color black is to the feather of a raven; yet the feather loses that color, not indeed so long as it is a feather, but because the feather is not always. Wherefore the matter itself is changeable; and whenever that animal or that feather ceases to be, and the whole of that body is changed and turned into earth, it loses certainly that color also. Although the kind of accident which is called separable may likewise be lost, not by separation, but by change; as, for instance, blackness is called a separable accident to the hair of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, because hair continuing to be hair can grow white; yet, if carefully considered, it is sufficiently apparent, that it is not as if anything departed by separation away from the head when it grows white, as though blackness departed thence and went somewhere and whiteness came in its place, but that the quality of color there is turned and changed. Therefore there is nothing accidental in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because there is nothing changeable or that may be lost. But if you choose to call that also accidental, which, although it may not be lost, yet can be decreased or increased&mdash;as, for instance, the life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for as long as it is a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so long it lives, and because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is always, it always lives; but because it lives more when it is wise, and less when it is foolish, here, too, some change comes to pass, not such that life is absent, as wisdom is absent to the foolish, but such that it is less&mdash;nothing of this kind, either, happens to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He remains altogether unchangeable.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; Nothing is Spoken of God According to Accident, But According to Substance or According to Relation.</h2>

<p>6. Wherefore nothing in Him is said in respect to accident, since nothing is accidental to Him, and yet all that is said is not said according to substance. For in created and changeable things, that which is not said according to substance, must, by necessary alternative, be said according to accident. For all things are accidents to them, which can be either lost or diminished, whether magnitudes or qualities; and so also is that which is said in relation to something, as friendships, relationships, services, likenesses, equalities, and anything else of the kind; so also positions and conditions,  places and times, acts and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But in God nothing is said to be according to accident, because in Him nothing is changeable; and yet everything that is said, is not said, according to substance. For it is said in relation to something, as the Father in relation to the Son and the Son in relation to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, which is not accident; because both the one is always Father, and the other is always Son: yet not <q>always,</q> meaning from the time when the Son was born [<em>natus</em>], so that the Father ceases not to be the Father because the Son never <em>ceases</em> to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but because the Son was <em>always</em> born, and never began to be the Son. But if He had begun to be at any time, or were at any time to cease to be, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, then He would be called Son according to accident. But if the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in that He is called the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, were so called in relation to Himself, not to the Son; and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in that He is called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, were so called in relation to Himself, not to the Father; then both the one would be called Father, and the other Son, according to substance. But because the Father is not called the Father except in that He has a Son, and the Son is not called Son except in that He has a Father, these things are not said according to substance; because each of them is not so called in relation to Himself, but the terms are used reciprocally and in relation each to the other; nor yet according to accident, because both the being called the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the being called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and unchangeable to them. Wherefore, although to be the Father and to be the Son is different, yet their substance is not different; because they are so called, not according to substance, but according to relation, which relation, however, is not accident, because it is not changeable.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; Reply is Made to the Cavils of the Heretics in Respect to the Same Words Begotten and Unbegotten.</h2>

<p>7. But if they think they can answer this reasoning thus&mdash;that the Father indeed is so called in relation to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Son in relation to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but that they are said to be unbegotten and begotten in relation to themselves, not in relation each to the other; for that it is not the same thing to call Him unbegotten as it is to call Him the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because there would be nothing to hinder our calling Him unbegotten even if He had not begotten the Son; and if any one beget a son, he is not therefore himself unbegotten, for men, who are begotten by other men, themselves also beget others; and therefore they say the Father is called Father in relation to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Son is called Son in relation to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but unbegotten is said in relation to Himself, and begotten in relation to Himself; and therefore, if whatever is said in relation to oneself is said according to substance,  while to be unbegotten and to be begotten are different, then the substance is different:&mdash; if this is what they say, then they do not understand that they do indeed say something that requires more careful discussion in respect to the term unbegotten, because neither is any one therefore a father because unbegotten, nor therefore unbegotten because he is a father, and on that account he is supposed to be called unbegotten, not in relation to anything else, but in respect to himself; but, on the other hand, with a wonderful blindness, they do not perceive that no one can be said to be begotten except in relation to something. For he is therefore a son because begotten; and because a son, therefore certainly begotten. And as is the relation of son to father, so is the relation of the begotten to the begetter; and as is the relation of father to son, so is the relation of the begetter to the begotten. And therefore any one is understood to be a begetter under one notion, but understood to be unbegotten under another. For though both are said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, yet the former is said in relation to the begotten, that is to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, which, indeed, they do not deny; but that He is called unbegotten, they declare to be said in respect to Himself. They say then, If anything is said to be a father in respect to itself, which cannot be said to be a son in respect to itself, and whatever is said in respect to self is said according to substance; and He is said to be unbegotten in respect to Himself, which the Son cannot be said to be; therefore He is said to be unbegotten according to substance; and because the Son cannot be so said to be, therefore He is not of the same substance. This subtlety is to be answered by compelling them to say themselves according to what it is that the Son is equal to the Father; whether according to that which is said in relation to Himself, or according to that which is said in relation to the Father. For it is not according to that which is said in relation to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, since in relation to the Father He is said to be Son, and the Father is not Son, but Father. Since Father and Son are not so called in relation to each other in the same way as friends and neighbors are; for a friend is so called relatively to his friend, and if they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> each other equally, then the same friendship is in both; and a neighbor is so called relatively to a neighbor, and because they are equally neighbors to each other (for each is neighbor to the other, in the same degree as the other is neighbor to him), there is the same neighborhood in both. But because the Son is not so called relatively to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, it is not according to that which is said in relation to the Father that the Son is equal to the Father; and it remains that He is equal according to that which is said in relation to Himself. But whatever is said in relation to self is said according to substance: it remains therefore that He is equal according to substance; therefore the substance of both is the same. But when the Father is said to be unbegotten, it is not said what He is, but what He is not; and when a relative term is denied, it is not denied according to substance, since the relative itself is not affirmed according to substance.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; The Addition of a Negative Does Not Change the Predicament.</h2>

<p>8. This is to be made clear by examples. And first we must notice, that by the word begotten is signified the same thing as is signified by the word son. For therefore a son, because begotten, and because a son, therefore certainly begotten. By the word unbegotten, therefore, it is declared that he is not son. But begotten and unbegotten are both of them terms suitably employed; whereas in Latin we can use the word <q>filius,</q> but the custom of the language does not allow us to speak of <q>infilius.</q> It makes no difference, however, in the meaning if he is called <q>non filius;</q> just as it is precisely the same thing if he is called <q>non genitus,</q> instead of <q>ingenitus.</q> For so the terms of both neighbor and friend are used relatively, yet we cannot speak of <q>invicinus</q> as we can of <q>inimicus.</q> Wherefore, in speaking of this thing or that, we must not consider what the usage of our own language either allows or does not allow, but what clearly appears to be the meaning of the things themselves. Let us not therefore any longer call it unbegotten, although it can be so called in Latin; but instead of this let us call it not begotten, which means the same. Is this then anything else than saying that he is not a son? Now the prefixing of that negative particle does not make that to be said according to substance, which, without it, is said relatively; but that only is denied, which, without it, was affirmed, as in the other predicaments. When we say he is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, we denote substance. He therefore who says he is not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, enunciates no other kind of predicament, but only denies that. As therefore I affirm according to substance in saying he is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so I deny according to substance in saying he is not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And when the question is asked how large he is? And I say he is quadrupedal, that is, four feet in measure, I affirm according to quantity, and he who says he is not quadrupedal, denies according to quantity. I say he is white, I affirm according to quality; if I say he is not white, I deny according to quality. I say he is near, I affirm according to relation; if I say he is not near, I deny according to relation. I affirm according to position, when I say he lies down; I deny according to position, when I say he does not lie down. I speak according to condition,  when I say he is armed; I deny according to condition, when I say he is not armed; and it comes to the same thing as if I should say he is unarmed. I affirm according to time, when I say he is of yesterday; I deny according to time, when I say he is not of yesterday. And when I say he is at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, I affirm according to place; and I deny according to place, when I say he is not at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. I affirm according to the predicament of action, when I say he smites; but if I say he does not smite, I deny according to action, so as to declare that he does not so act. And when I say he is smitten, I affirm according to the predicament of passion; and I deny according to the same, when I say he is not smitten. And, in a word, there is no kind of predicament according to which we may please to affirm anything, without being <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to deny according to the same predicament, if we prefix the negative particle. And since this is so, if I were to affirm according to substance, in saying son, I should deny according to substance, in saying not son. But because I affirm relatively when I say he is a son, for I refer to the father; therefore I deny relatively if I say he is not a son, for I refer the same negation to the father, in that I wish to declare that he has not a parent. But if to be called son is precisely equivalent to the being called begotten (as we said before), then to be called not begotten is precisely equivalent to the being called not son. But we deny relatively when we say he is not son, therefore we deny relatively when we say he is not begotten. Further, what is unbegotten, unless not begotten? We do not escape, therefore, from the relative predicament, when he is called unbegotten. For as begotten is not said in relation to self, but in that he is <em>of</em> a begetter; so when one is called unbegotten, he is not so called in relation to himself, but it is declared that he is not <em>of</em> a begetter. Both meanings, however, turn upon the same predicament, which is called that of relation. But that which is asserted relatively does not denote substance, and accordingly, although begotten and unbegotten are diverse, they do not denote a different substance; because, as son is referred to father, and not son to not father, so it follows inevitably that begotten must be referred to begetter, and not-begotten to not-begetter. </p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; Whatever is Spoken of God According to Substance, is Spoken of Each Person Severally, and Together of the Trinity Itself. One Essence in God, and Three, in Greek, Hypostases, in Latin, Persons.</h2>

<p>9. Wherefore let us hold this above all, that whatsoever is said of that most eminent and divine loftiness in respect to itself, is said in respect to substance, but that which is said in relation to anything, is not said in respect to substance, but relatively; and that the effect of the same substance in Father and Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is, that whatsoever is said of each in respect to themselves, is to be taken of them, not in the plural in sum, but in the singular. For as the Father is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which no one doubts to be said in respect to substance, yet we do not say that the very Supreme Trinity itself is three Gods, but one God. So the Father is great, the Son great, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> great; yet not three greats, but one great. For it is not written of the Father alone, as they perversely suppose, but of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, <q>You are great: You are God alone.</q>  And the Father is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the Son good, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> good; yet not three goods, but one good, of whom it is said, <q>None is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, save one, that is, God.</q> For the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, lest He should be understood as man only by him who said, <q>Good Master,</q> as addressing a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, does not therefore say, There is none good, save the Father alone; but, <q>None is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, save one, that is, God.</q>  For the Father by Himself is declared by the name of Father; but by the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both Himself and the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, because the Trinity is one God. But position, and condition, and places, and times, are not said to be in God properly, but metaphorically and through similitudes. For He is both said to dwell between the cherubims,  which is spoken in respect to position; and to be covered with the deep as with a garment,  which is said in respect to condition; and <q>Your years shall have no end,</q>  which is said in respect of time; and, <q>If I ascend up into heaven, You are there,</q>  which is said in respect to place. And as respects action (or making), perhaps it may be said most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> of God alone, for God alone makes and Himself is not made. Nor is He liable to <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> as far as belongs to that substance whereby He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So the Father is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, the Son <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>; yet not three omnipotents, but one <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>:  <q>For of Him are all things, and through Him are all things, and in Him are all things; to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q>  Whatever, therefore, is spoken of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in respect to Himself, is both spoken singly of each person, that is, of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and together of the Trinity itself, not plurally but in the singular. For inasmuch as to God it is not one thing to be, and another thing to be great, but to Him it is the same thing to be, as it is to be great; therefore, as we do not say three essences, so we do not say three greatnesses, but one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and one greatness. I say <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which in Greek is called <span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, and which we call more usually substance.</p>

<p>10. They indeed use also the word hypostasis; but they intend to put a difference, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what, between <span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span> and hypostasis: so that most of ourselves who treat these things in the Greek language, are accustomed to say, <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03BD; &#x03BF;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;, &#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03C2; &#x1F51;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F71;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span> or in Latin, one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, three substances. </p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; The Three Persons Not Properly So Called [in a Human Sense].</h2>

<p>But because with us the usage has already obtained, that by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> we understand the same thing which is understood by substance; we do not dare to say one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, three substances, but one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or substance and three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>: as many writers in Latin, who treat of these things, and are of authority, have said, in that they could not find any other more suitable way by which to enunciate in words that which they understood without words. For, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as the Father is not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Son is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> who is also called the gift of God is neither the Father nor the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, certainly they are three. And so it is said plurally, <q>I and my Father are one.</q>  For He has not said, <q> <em>is</em> one,</q> as the Sabellians say; but, <q> <em>are</em> one.</q> Yet, when the question is asked, What three? <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> language labors altogether under great poverty of speech. The answer, however, is given, three <q><a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>,</q> not that it might be [completely] spoken, but that it might not be left [wholly] unspoken.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; Those Things Which Belong Absolutely to God as an Essence, are Spoken of the Trinity in the Singular, Not in the Plural.</h2>

<p>11. As, therefore, we do not say three essences, so we do not say three greatnesses, or three who are great. For in things which are great by partaking of greatness, to which it is one thing to <em>be</em>, and another to be <em> great</em>, as a great house, and a great mountain, and a great mind; in these things, I say, greatness is one thing, and that which is great because of greatness is another, and a great house, certainly, is not absolute greatness itself. But that is absolute greatness by which not only a great house is great, and any great mountain is great, but also by which every other thing whatsoever is great, which is called great; so that greatness itself is one thing, and those things are another which are called great from it. And this greatness certainly is primarily great, and in a much more excellent way than those things which are great by partaking of it. But since God is not great with that greatness which is not Himself, so that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in being great, is, as it were, partaker of that greatness&mdash;otherwise that will be a greatness greater than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereas there is nothing greater than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; therefore, He is great with that greatness by which He Himself is that same greatness. And, therefore, as we do not say three essences, so neither do we say three greatnesses; for it is the same thing to God to be, and to be great. For the same reason neither do we say three greats, but one who is great; since God is not great by partaking of greatness, but He is great by Himself being great, because He Himself is His own greatness. Let the same be said also of the goodness, and of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and of the omnipotence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, in short, of all the predicaments which can be predicated of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as He is spoken of in respect to Himself, not metaphorically and by similitude, but properly, if indeed anything can be spoken of Him properly, by the mouth of man.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; What is Said Relatively in the Trinity.</h2>

<p>12. But whereas, in the same Trinity, some things severally are specially predicated, these are in no way said in reference to themselves in themselves, but either in mutual reference, or in respect to the creature; and, therefore, it is manifest that such things are spoken relatively, not in the way of substance. For the Trinity is called one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, great, good, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>; and the same God Himself may be called His own deity, His own magnitude, His own goodness, His own <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, His own omnipotence: but the Trinity cannot in the same way be called the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, except perhaps metaphorically, in respect to the creature, on account of the adoption of sons. For that which is written, <q>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: the Lord our God is one Lord,</q>  ought certainly not to be understood as if the Son were excepted, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> were excepted; which one Lord our God we rightly call also our Father, as regenerating us by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Neither can the Trinity in any wise be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but it can be called, in its entirety, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, according to that which is written, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a Spirit;</q>  because both the Father is a spirit and the Son is a spirit, and the Father is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and the Son is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. Therefore, since the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and certainly God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and God is a spirit, the Trinity can be called also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But yet that <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who is not the Trinity, but is understood as in the Trinity, is spoken of in His proper name of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> relatively, since He is referred both to the Father and to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is the Spirit both of the Father and of the Son. But the relation is not itself apparent in that name, but it is apparent when He is called the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;  for He is the gift of the Father and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because <q>He proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q>  as the Lord says; and because that which the apostle says, <q>Now, if any man have not the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he is none of His,</q>  he says certainly of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> Himself. When we say, therefore, the gift of the giver, and the giver of the gift, we speak in both cases relatively in reciprocal reference. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is a certain unutterable communion of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; and on that account, perhaps, He is so called, because the same name is suitable to both the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. For He Himself is called specially that which they are called in common; because both the Father is a spirit and the Son a spirit, both the Father is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and the Son <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.  In order, therefore, that the communion of both may be signified from a name which is suitable to both, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is called the gift of both. And this Trinity is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, alone, good, great, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>; itself its own unity, deity, greatness, goodness, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, omnipotence.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; In Relative Things that are Reciprocal, Names are Sometimes Wanting.</h2>

<p>13. Neither ought it to influence us&mdash; since we have said that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is so called relatively, not the Trinity itself, but He who is in the Trinity&mdash; that the designation of Him to whom He is referred, does not seem to answer in turn to His designation. For we cannot, as we say the servant of a master, and the master of a servant, the son of a father and the father of a son, so also say here&mdash; because these things are said relatively. For we speak of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of the Father; but, on the other hand, we do not speak of the Father of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, lest the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> should be understood to be His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. So also we speak of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of the Son; but we do not speak of the Son of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, lest the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> be understood to be His Father. For it is the case in many <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>, that no designation is to be found by which those things which bear relation to each other may [in name] mutually correspond to each other. For what is more clearly spoken relatively than the word earnest? Since it is referred to that of which it is an earnest, and an earnest is always an earnest of something. Can we then, as we say, the earnest of the Father and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,  say in turn, the Father of the earnest or the Son of the earnest? But, on the other hand, when we say the gift of the Father and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, we cannot indeed say the Father of the gift, or the Son of the gift; but that these may correspond mutually to each other, we say the gift of the giver and the giver of the gift; because here a word in use may be found, there it cannot.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; How the Word Beginning (Principium) is Spoken Relatively in the Trinity.</h2>

<p>14. The Father is called so, therefore, relatively, and He is also relatively said to be the Beginning, and whatever else there may be of the kind; but He is called the Father in relation to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the Beginning in relation to all things, which are from Him. So the Son is relatively so called; He is called also relatively the Word and the Image. And in all these appellations He is referred to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but the Father is called by none of them. And the Son is also called the Beginning; for when it was said to Him, <q>Who are You?</q> He replied, <q>Even the Beginning, who also speak to you.</q>  But is He, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, the Beginning of the Father? For He intended to show Himself to be the Creator when He said that He was the Beginning, as the Father also is the beginning of the creature in that all things are from Him. For creator, too, is spoken relatively to creature, as master to servant. And so when we say, both that the Father is the Beginning, and that the Son is the Beginning, we do not speak of two beginnings of the creature; since both the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> together is one beginning in respect to the creature, as one Creator, as one God. But if whatever remains within itself and produces or works anything is a beginning to that thing which it produces or works; then we cannot deny that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also is rightly called the Beginning, since we do not separate Him from the appellation of Creator: and it is written of Him that He works; and assuredly, in working, He remains within Himself; for He Himself is not changed and turned into any of the things which He works. And see what it is that He works: <q>But the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>,</q> he says, <q>is given to every man to profit withal. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by the same Spirit; to another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; to another <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; to another the discerning of spirits; to another various kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: but all these works that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will;</q> certainly as God&mdash; for who can work such great things but God?&mdash; but <q>it is the same God which works all in all.</q>  For if we are asked point by point concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, we answer most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> together He is one God. Therefore, God is spoken of as one Beginning in respect to the creature, not as two or three beginnings.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; The Father and the Son the Only Beginning (Principium) of the Holy Spirit.</h2>

<p>15. But in their mutual relation to one another in the Trinity itself, if the begetter is a beginning in relation to that which he begets, the Father is a beginning in relation to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because He begets Him; but whether the Father is also a beginning in relation to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, since it is said, <q>He proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> is no small question. Because, if it is so, He will not only be a beginning to that thing which He begets or makes, but also to that which He gives. And here, too, that question comes to light, as it can, which is wont to trouble many, Why the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not also a son, since He, too, comes forth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as it is read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.  For the Spirit came forth, not as born, but as given; and so He is not called a son, because He was neither born, as the Only-begotten, nor made, so that by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God He might be born into adoption, as we are. For that which is born of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is referred to the Father only when called Son, and so the Son is the Son of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and not also our Son; but that which is given is referred both to Him who gave, and to those to whom He gave; and so the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not only the Spirit of the Father and of the Son who gave Him, but He is also called ours, who have received Him: as <q>The <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the Lord,</q>  who gives <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, is said also to be our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, who have received it. Therefore, the Spirit is both the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> who gave Him, and ours who have received Him. Not, indeed, that spirit of ours by which we are, because that is the spirit of a man which is in him; but this Spirit is ours in another mode, <em>viz</em>. that in which we also say, <q>Give us this day our bread.</q>  Although certainly we have received that spirit also, which is called the spirit of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. <q>For what have you,</q> he says, <q>which you did not receive?</q>  But that is one thing, which we have received that we might be; another, that which we have received that we might be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. Whence it is also written of John, that he <q>came in the spirit and power of Elias;</q>  and by the spirit of Elias is meant the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, whom Elias received. And the same thing is to be understood of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when the Lord says to him, <q>And I will take of your spirit, and will put it upon them;</q>  that is, I will give to them of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which I have already given to you. If, therefore, that also which is given has him for a beginning by whom it is given, since it has received from no other source that which proceeds from him; it must be admitted that the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are a Beginning of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, not two Beginnings; but as the Father and Son are one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and one Creator, and one Lord relatively to the creature, so are they one Beginning relatively to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is one Beginning in respect to the creature, as also one Creator and one God. </p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; Whether the Holy Spirit Was a Gift Before as Well as After He Was Given.</h2>

<p>16. But it is asked further, whether, as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, by being born, has not only this, that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but that He is absolutely; and so also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, by being given, has not only this, that He is given, but that He is absolutely&mdash; whether therefore He was, before He was given, but was not yet a <em>gift</em>; or whether, for the very reason that God was about to give Him, He was already a gift also before He was given. But if He does not proceed unless when He is given, and assuredly could not proceed before there was one to whom He might be given; how, in that case, was He [absolutely] in His very substance, if He is not unless because He is given? just as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, by being born, not only has this, that He is a Son, which is said relatively, but His very substance absolutely, so that He is. Does the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> proceed always, and proceed not in time, but from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, but because He so proceeded that He was capable of being given, was already a gift even before there was one to whom He might be given? For there is a difference in meaning between a gift and a thing that has been given. For a gift may exist even before it is given; but it cannot be called a thing that has been given unless it has been given.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; What is Said of God in Time, is Said Relatively, Not Accidentally.</h2>

<p>17. Nor let it trouble us that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, although He is co-eternal with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, yet is called something which exists in time; as, for instance, this very thing which we have called Him, a thing that has been given. For the Spirit is a gift <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, but a thing that has been given in time. For if a lord also is not so called unless when he begins to have a slave, that appellation likewise is relative and in time to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for the creature is not from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, of which He is the Lord. How then shall we make it good that relative terms themselves are not accidental, since nothing happens accidentally to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in time, because He is incapable of change, as we have argued in the beginning of this discussion? Behold! To be the Lord, is not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; otherwise we should be compelled to say that the creature also is from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, since He would not be a lord from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> unless the creature also was a servant from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. But as he cannot be a slave who has not a lord, neither can he be a lord who has not a slave. And if there be any one who says that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, indeed, is alone <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and that times are not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> on account of their variety and changeableness, but that times nevertheless did not begin to be in time (for there was no time before times began, and therefore it did not happen to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in time that He should be Lord, since He was Lord of the very times themselves, which assuredly did not begin in time): what will he reply respecting man, who was made in time, and of whom assuredly He was not the Lord before he was of whom He was to be Lord? Certainly to be the Lord of man happened to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in time. And that all dispute may seem to be taken away, certainly to be your Lord, or mine, who have only lately begun to be, happened to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in time. Or if this, too, seems uncertain on account of the obscure question respecting the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, what is to be said of His being the Lord of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? Since, although the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, which that people had (a matter into which we do not now inquire), yet that people <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> not as yet, and the time is apparent when it began to exist. Lastly, that He should be Lord of this or that tree, or of this or that grain crop, which only lately began to be, happened in time; since, although the matter itself already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, yet it is one thing to be Lord of the matter (<em>materi&aelig;</em>), another to be Lord of the already created nature (<em>natur&aelig;</em>).  For man, too, is lord of the wood at one time, and at another he is lord of the chest, although fabricated of that same wood; which he certainly was not at the time when he was already the lord of the wood. How then shall we make it good that nothing is said of God according to accident, except because nothing happens to His nature by which He may be changed, so that those things are relative accidents which happen in connection with some change of the things of which they are spoken. As a friend is so called relatively: for he does not begin to be one, unless when he has begun to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; therefore some change of will takes place, in order that he may be called a friend. And money, when it is called a price, is spoken of relatively, and yet it was not changed when it began to be a price; nor, again, when it is called a pledge, or any other thing of the kind. If, therefore, money can so often be spoken of relatively with no change of itself, so that neither when it begins, nor when it ceases to be so spoken of, does any change take place in that nature or form of it, whereby it is money; how much more easily ought we to admit, concerning that unchangeable substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that something may be so predicated relatively in respect to the creature, that although it begin to be so predicated in time, yet nothing shall be understood to have happened to the substance itself of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only to that creature in respect to which it is predicated? <q>Lord,</q> it is said, <q>You have been made our refuge.</q>  <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, is said to be our refuge relatively, for He is referred to us, and He then becomes our refuge when we flee to Him; <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> does anything come to pass then in His nature, which, before we fled to Him, was not? In us therefore some change does take place; for we were worse before we fled to Him, and we become better by fleeing to Him: but in Him there is no change. So also He begins to be our Father, when we are regenerated through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since He gave us power to become the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  Our substance therefore is changed for the better, when we become His sons; and He at the same time begins to be our Father, but without any change of His own substance. Therefore that which begins to be spoken of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in time, and which was not spoken of Him before, is manifestly spoken of Him relatively; yet not according to any accident of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that anything should have happened to Him, but clearly according to some accident of that, in respect to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> begins to be called something relatively. When a righteous man begins to be a friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he himself is changed; but far be it from us to say, that God loves any one in time with as it were a new <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which was not in Him before, with whom things gone by have not passed away and things future have been already done. Therefore He loved all His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> before the foundation of the world, as He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> them; but when they are converted and find them; then they are said to begin to be loved by Him, that what is said may be said in that way in which it can be comprehended by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affections. So also, when He is said to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the unrighteous, and gentle with the good, they are changed, not He: just as the light is troublesome to weak eyes, pleasant to those that are strong; namely, by their change, not its own.</p>
