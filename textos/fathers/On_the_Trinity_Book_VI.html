<h1>On the Trinity (Book VI)</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">The question is proposed, how the apostle calls Christ <q>the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And an argument is raised, whether the Father is not wisdom Himself, but only the Father of wisdom; or whether Wisdom begot Wisdom. But the answer to this is deferred for a little, while the unity and equality of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>; and that we ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a Trinity, not in a threefold (triplicem) god. Lastly, that saying of Hilary is explained, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, appearance in the image, use in the gift.</span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; The Son, According to the Apostle, is the Power and Wisdom of the Father. Hence the Reasoning of the Catholics Against the Earlier Arians. A Difficulty is Raised, Whether the Father is Not Wisdom Himself, But Only the Father of Wisdom.</h2>

<p>1. Some think themselves hindered from admitting the equality of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, because it is written, <q>Christ, the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> in that, on this ground, there does not appear to be equality; because the Father is not Himself power and wisdom, but the begetter of power and wisdom. And, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the question is usually asked with no common earnestness, in what way God can be called the Father of power and wisdom. For the apostle says, <q>Christ the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  And hence some on our side have reasoned in this way against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, at least against those who at first set themselves up against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> himself is reported to have said, that if He is a Son, then He was born; if He was born, there was a time when the Son was not: not understanding that even to be born is, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; so that the Son is co-eternal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as the brightness which is produced and is spread around by fire is co-eval with it, and would be co-eternal, if fire were <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. And therefore some of the later <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> have abandoned that opinion, and have confessed that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not begin to be in time. But among the arguments which those on our side used to hold against them who said that there was a time when the Son was not, some were wont to introduce such an argument as this: If the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is the power and wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God was never without power and wisdom, then the Son is co-eternal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father; but the apostle says, <q>Christ the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and a man must be senseless to say that God at any time had not power or wisdom; therefore there was no time when the Son was not.</p>

<p>2. Now this argument compels us to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is not wise, except by having the wisdom which He begot, not by the Father in Himself being wisdom itself. Further, if it be so, just as the Son also Himself is called God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Light of Light, we must consider whether He can be called wisdom of wisdom, if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is not wisdom itself, but only the begetter of wisdom. And if we hold this, why is He not the begetter also of His own greatness, and of His own goodness, and of His own <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and of His own omnipotence; so that He is not Himself His own greatness, and His own goodness, and His own <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and His own omnipotence; but is great with that greatness which He begot, and good with that goodness, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> with that omnipotence, which was born of Him; just as He Himself is not His own wisdom, but is wise with that wisdom which was born of Him? For we need not be afraid of being compelled to say that there are many sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, over and above the adoption of the creature, co-eternal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, if He be the begetter of His own greatness, and goodness, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and omnipotence. Because it is easy to reply to this cavil, that it does not at all follow, because many things are named, that He should be the Father of many co-eternal <em>sons</em>; just as it does not follow that He is the Father of two sons, because Christ is said to be the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For that certainly is the power which is the wisdom, and that is the wisdom which is the power; and in like manner, therefore, of the rest also; so that that is the greatness which is the power, or any other of those things which either have been mentioned above, or may hereafter be mentioned.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2 .&mdash; What is Said of the Father and Son Together, and What Not.</h2>

<p>3. But if nothing is spoken of the Father as such, except that which is spoken of Him in relation to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that is, that He is His father, or begetter, or beginning; and if also the begetter is by consequence a beginning to that which he begets of himself; but whatever else is spoken of Him is so spoken as <em>with</em> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or rather <em>in</em> the Son; whether that He is great with that greatness which He begot, or just with that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> which He begot, or good with that goodness which He begot, or powerful with that force or power which He begot, or wise with that wisdom which He begot: yet the Father is not said to be greatness itself, but the begetter of greatness; but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as He is called the Son as such, is not so called <em> with</em> the Father but in relation <em>to</em> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, so is not great in and by himself, but <em>with</em> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of whom He is the greatness; and so also is called wise <em>with</em> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of whom He Himself is the wisdom; just as the Father is called wise <em>with</em> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because He is wise with that wisdom which He begot; therefore the one is not called without the other, whatever they are called in respect to themselves; that is, whatever they are called that manifests their essential nature, both are so called together&mdash;if these things are so, then the Father is not God without the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, nor the Son God without the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but both together are God. And that which is said, <q>In the beginning was the Word,</q> means that the Word was in the Father. Or if <q>In the beginning</q> is intended to mean, Before all things; then in that which follows, <q>And the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> the Son alone is understood to be the Word, not the Father and Son together, as though both were one Word (for He is the Word in the same way as He is the Image, but the Father and Son are not both together the Image, but the Son alone is the Image of the Father: just as He is also the Son of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for both together are not the Son). But in that which is added, <q>And the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> there is much reason to understand thus: <q>The Word,</q> which is the Son alone, <q>was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> which is not the Father alone, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> together.  But what wonder is there, if this can be said in the case of some twofold things widely different from each other? For what are so different as <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body? Yet we can say the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that is, in a man; although the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not the body, and man is both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body together. So that what follows in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>And the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  may be understood thus: The Word, which is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, was God together with the Father. Are we then to say thus, that the Father is the begetter of His own greatness, that is, the begetter of His own power, or the begetter of His own wisdom; and that the Son is greatness, and power, and wisdom; but that the great, <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, and wise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is both together? How then God <em>of</em> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Light of Light? For not both together are God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only the Son is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is to say, of the Father; nor are both together Light of Light, but the Son only is of Light, that is, of the Father. Unless, perhaps, it was in order to intimate and inculcate briefly that the Son is co-eternal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that it is said, God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Light of Light, or anything else of the like kind: as if to say, This which is not the Son without the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <em>of</em> this which is not the Father without the Son; that is, this Light which is not Light without the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <em>of</em> that Light, <em> viz</em>. the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, which is not Light without the Son; so that, when it is said, God which is not the Son without the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and <em>of</em> God which is not the Father without the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, it may be perfectly understood that the Begetter did not precede that which He begot. And if this be so, then this alone cannot be said of them, namely, this or that of this or that, which they are not both together. Just as the Word cannot be said to be <em>of</em> the Word, because both are not the Word together, but only the Son; nor image <em>of</em> image, since they are not both together the image; nor Son <em>of</em> Son, since both together are not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, according to that which is said, <q>I and my Father are one.</q>  For <q>we are one</q> means, what He is, that am I also; according to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, not according to relation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; That the Unity of the Essence of the Father and the Son is to Be Gathered from the Words, <q>We are One.</q> The Son is Equal to the Father Both in Wisdom and in All Other Things.</h2>

<p>4. And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether the words, <q>They are one,</q> are ever found in Scripture as spoken of things of which the nature is different. But if there are more things than one of the same nature, and they differ in sentiment, they are not one, and that so far as they differ in sentiment. For if the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were already one by the fact of being men, He would not say, <q>That they may be one, as we are one,</q>  when commending them to the Father. But because <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Apollos were both alike men, and also of like sentiments, <q>He that plants,</q> he says, <q>and he that waters are one.</q>  When, therefore, anything is so called one, that it is not added in what it is one, and yet more things than one are called one, then the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and nature is signified, not differing nor disagreeing. But when it is added in what it is one, it may be meant that something is made one out of things more than one, though they are different in nature. As <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body are assuredly not one; for, what are so different? Unless there be added, or understood in what they are one, that is, one man, or one animal [person]. Thence the apostle says, <q>He who is joined to a harlot, is one body;</q> he does not say, they are one or he is one; but he has added <q>body,</q> as though it were one body composed by being joined together of two different bodies, masculine and feminine.  And, <q>He that is joined unto the Lord,</q> he says, is one spirit: he did not say, he that is joined unto the Lord is one, or they are one; but he added, <q>spirit.</q> For the spirit of man and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> are different in nature; but by being joined they become one spirit of two different spirits, so that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> is blessed and perfect without the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> spirit, but the spirit of man cannot be blessed without God. Nor is it without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, I think, that when the Lord said so much in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John, and so often, of unity itself, whether of His own with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or of ours interchangeably with ourselves; He has nowhere said, that we are also one with Himself, but, <q>that they maybe one as we also are one.</q>  Therefore the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are one, undoubtedly according to unity of substance; and there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, and one great, and one wise, as we have argued.</p>

<p>5. Whence then is the Father greater? For if greater, He is greater by greatness; but whereas the Son is His greatness, neither assuredly is the Son greater than He who begot Him, nor is the Father greater than that greatness, whereby He is great; therefore they are equal. For whence is He equal, if not in that which He is, to whom it is not one thing to be, and another to be great? Or if the Father is greater in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, the Son is not equal in anything whatsoever. For whence equal? If you say in greatness, that greatness is not equal which is less <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and so of all things else. Or is He perhaps equal in power, but not equal in wisdom? But how is that power which is less wise, equal? Or is He equal in wisdom, but not equal in power? But how is that wisdom equal which is less powerful? It remains, therefore, that if He is not equal in anything, He is not equal in all. But Scripture proclaims, that <q>He thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Therefore any adversary of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whatever, provided he feels bound by <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> authority, must needs confess that the Son is equal with God in each one thing whatsoever. Let him choose that which he will; from it he will be shown, that He is equal in all things which are said of His substance.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; The Same Argument Continued.</h2>

<p>6. For in like manner the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, although each has its own several and different meaning, yet are in no way mutually separable; so that, for instance, whosoever were equal in <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, are equal also in <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For if you say that such and such men are equal in <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, but that one of them is greater in <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, it follows that the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of the other is less <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, and so neither are they equal in <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of the former is more <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>. And so you will find it to be the case with the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, if you consider them one by one. For the question is not of the strength of the body, but of the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of the mind. How much more therefore is this the case in that unchangeable and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> substance, which is incomparably more simple than the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is? Since, in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to be is not the same as to be strong, or <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, or just, or temperate; for a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> can exist, and yet have none of these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But in God to be is the same as to be strong, or to be just, or to be wise, or whatever is said of that simple multiplicity, or multifold simplicity, whereby to signify His substance. Wherefore, whether we say God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in such way that this name belongs to each, yet not so that both together are two Gods, but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for they are in such way united with each other, as according to the apostle's testimony may take place even in diverse and differing substances; for both the Lord alone is a Spirit, and the spirit of a man alone is assuredly a spirit; yet, if it cleave to the Lord, <q>it is one spirit:</q> how much more there, where there is an absolutely inseparable and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> union, so that He may not seem absurdly to be called as it were the Son of both, when He is called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, if that which is called God is only said of both together. Or perhaps it is, that whatever is said of God so as to indicate His substance, is not said except of both together, nay of the Trinity itself together? Whether therefore it be this or that (which needs a closer inquiry), it is enough for the present to see from what has been said, that the Son is in no respect equal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, if He is found to be unequal in anything which has to do with signifying His substance, as we have already shown. But the apostle has said that He is equal. Therefore the Son is equal with the Father in all things, and is of one and the same substance.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; The Holy Spirit Also is Equal to the Father and the Son in All Things.</h2>

<p>7. Wherefore also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> consists in the same unity of substance, and in the same equality. For whether He is the unity of both, or the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, or therefore the unity because the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and therefore the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> because the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, it is manifest that He is not one of the two, through whom the two are joined, through whom the Begotten is loved by the Begetter, and loves Him that begot Him, and through whom, not by participation, but by their own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, neither by the gift of any superior, but by their own, they are <q>keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;</q>  which we are commanded to imitate by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, both towards God and towards ourselves. <q>On which two commandments hang all the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q>  So those three are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one, alone, great, wise, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, blessed. But we are blessed from Him, and through Him, and in Him; because we ourselves are one by His gift, and one spirit with Him, because our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cleaves to Him so as to follow Him. And it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for us to cleave to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He will destroy every man who is estranged from Him.  Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, whatever it is, is something common both to the Father and Son. But that communion itself is consubstantial and co-eternal; and if it may fitly be called friendship, let it be so called; but it is more aptly called <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And this is also a substance, since God is a substance, and <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> as it is written.  But as He is a substance together with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, so that substance is together with them great, and together with them good, and together with them <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and whatsoever else is said in reference to substance; since it is not one thing to God to be, and another to be great or to be good, and the rest, as we have shown above. For if <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is less great therein [<em>i.e.</em> in God] than wisdom, then wisdom is loved in less degree than according to what it is; <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is therefore equal, in order that wisdom may be loved according to its being; but wisdom is equal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above; therefore also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is equal; and if equal, equal in all things, on account of the absolute simplicity which is in that substance. And therefore they are not more than three: One who loves Him who is from Himself, and One who loves Him from whom He is, and Love itself. And if this last is nothing, how is <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a></q>? If it is not substance, how is God substance?</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; How God is a Substance Both Simple and Manifold.</h2>

<p>8. But if it is asked how that substance is both simple and manifold: consider, first, why the creature is manifold, but in no way really simple. And first, all that is body is composed certainly of parts; so that therein one part is greater, another less, and the whole is greater than any part whatever or how great soever. For the heaven and the earth are parts of the whole bulk of the world; and the earth alone, and the heaven alone, is composed of innumerable parts; and its third part is less than the remainder, and the half of it is less than the whole; and the whole body of the world, which is usually called by its two parts, <em>viz</em>. the heaven and the earth, is certainly greater than the heaven alone or the earth alone. And in each several body, size is one thing, color another, shape another; for the same color and the same shape may remain with diminished size; and the same shape and the same size may remain with the color changed; and the same shape not remaining, yet the thing may be just as great, and of the same color. And whatever other things are predicated together of body can be changed either all together, or the larger part of them without the rest. And hence the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of body is conclusively <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be manifold, and in no respect simple. The spiritual creature also, that is, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is indeed the more simple of the two if compared with the body; but if we omit the comparison with the body, it is manifold, and itself also not simple. For it is on this account more simple than the body, because it is not diffused in bulk through extension of place, but in each body, it is both whole in the whole, and whole in each several part of it; and, therefore, when anything takes place in any small particle whatever of the body, such as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can feel, although it does not take place in the whole body, yet the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> feels it, since the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not unconscious of it. But, nevertheless, since in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also it is one thing to be skillful, another to be indolent, another to be intelligent, another to be of retentive memory; since cupidity is one thing, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> another, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> another, sadness another; and since things innumerable, and in innumerable ways, are to be found in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, some without others, and some more, some less; it is manifest that its nature is not simple, but manifold. For nothing simple is changeable, but every creature is changeable.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; God is a Trinity, But Not Triple (Triplex).</h2>

<p>But God is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> called in manifold ways, great, good, wise, blessed, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and whatsoever other thing seems to be said of Him not unworthily: but His greatness is the same as His wisdom; for He is not great by bulk, but by power; and His goodness is the same as His wisdom and greatness, and His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the same as all those things; and in Him it is not one thing to be blessed, and another to be great, or wise, or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, or good, or in a word to be Himself.</p>

<p>9. Neither, since He is a Trinity, is He therefore to be thought triple (<em>triplex</em>)  otherwise the Father alone, or the Son alone, will be less than the Father and Son together. Although, indeed, it is hard to see how we can say, either the Father alone, or the Son alone; since both the Father is with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Son with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, always and inseparably: not that both are the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or both are the Son; but because they are always one in relation to the other, and neither the one nor the other alone. But because we call even the Trinity itself God alone, although He is always with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> spirits and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, but say that He only is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because they are not also God with Him; so we call the Father the Father alone, not because He is separate from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but because they are not both together the Father.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; No Addition Can Be Made to the Nature of God.</h2>

<p>Since, therefore, the Father alone, or the Son alone, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> alone, is as great as is the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> together,  in no manner is He to be called threefold. Forasmuch as bodies increase by union of themselves. For although he who cleaves to his wife is one body; yet it is a greater body than if it were that of the husband alone, or of the wife alone. But in spiritual things, when the less adheres to the greater, as the creature to the Creator, the former becomes greater than it was, not the latter.  For in those things which are not great by bulk, to be greater is to be better. And the spirit of any creature becomes better, when it cleaves to the Creator, than if it did not so cleave; and therefore also greater because better. <q>He,</q> then, that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit:  but yet the Lord does not therefore become greater, although he who is joined to the Lord does so. In God Himself, therefore when the equal Son, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> equal to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, is joined to the equal Father, God does not become greater than each of them severally; because that perfectness cannot increase. But whether it be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, He is perfect, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is perfect; and therefore He is a Trinity rather than triple.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; Whether One or the Three Persons Together are Called the Only God.</h2>

<p>10. And since we are showing how we can say the Father alone, because there is no Father in the Godhead except Himself, we must consider also the opinion which holds that the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God is not the Father alone, but the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For if any one should ask whether the Father alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how can it be replied that He is not, unless perhaps we were to say that the Father indeed is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that He is not God alone, but that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are God alone? But then what shall we do with that testimony of the Lord? For He was speaking to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and had named the Father as Him to whom He was speaking, when He says, <q>And this is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</q>  And this the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> indeed usually take, as if the Son were not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Passing them by, however, we must see whether, when it is said to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>That they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> we are forced to understand it as if He wished to intimate that the Father alone is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; lest we should not understand any to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except the three together, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Are we therefore, from the testimony of the Lord, both to call the Father the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Son the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> together, that is, the Trinity itself together, not three <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Gods but one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God? Or because He added, <q>And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> whom You have sent,</q> are we to supply <q>the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> so that the order of the words is this, <q>That they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> whom You have sent, the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God?</q> Why then did He omit to mention the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? Is it because it follows, that whenever we name One who cleaves to One by a harmony so great that through this harmony both are one, this harmony itself must be understood, although it is not mentioned? For in that place, too, the apostle seems as it were to pass over the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and yet there, too, He is understood, where he says, <q>All are yours, and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</q>  And again, <q>The head of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the man, the head of the man is Christ, and the head of Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  But again, if God is only all three together, how can God be the head of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is, the Trinity the head of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since Christ is in the Trinity in order that it may be the Trinity? Is that which is the Father with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the head of that which is the Son alone? For the Father with the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the Son alone is Christ: especially since it is the Word already made flesh that speaks; and according to this His humiliation also, the Father is greater than He, as He says, <q>for my Father is greater than I;</q>  so that the very being of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is one to Him with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is itself the head of the man who is mediator, which He is alone.  For if we rightly call the mind the chief thing of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that is, as it were the head of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> substance, although the man himself together with the mind is man; why is not the Word with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, which together is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, much more suitably and much more the head of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although Christ as man cannot be understood except with the Word which was made flesh? But this, as we have already said, we shall consider somewhat more carefully hereafter. At present the equality and one and the same substance of the Trinity has been demonstrated as briefly as possible, that in whatever way that other question be determined, the more rigorous discussion of which we have deferred, nothing may hinder us from confessing the absolute equality of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; Of the Attributes Assigned by Hilary to Each Person. The Trinity is Represented in Things that are Made.</h2>

<p>11. A certain writer, when he would briefly intimate the special attributes of each of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the Trinity, tells us that <q>Eternity is in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, form in the Image, use in the Gift.</q> And since he was a man of no mean authority in handling the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and in the assertion of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for it is Hilary who put this in his book (<em>On the Trinity, ii.</em>); I have searched into the hidden meaning of these words as far as I can, that is, of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Image, and the Gift, of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and of form, and of use. And I do not think that he intended more by the word eternity,  than that the Father has not a father from whom He is; but the Son is from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, so as to be, and so as to be co-eternal with Him. For if an image perfectly fills the measure of that of which it is the image, then the image is made equal to that of which it is the image, not the latter to its own image. And in respect to this image he has named form, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in account of the quality of beauty, where there is at once such great fitness, and prime equality, and prime likeness, differing in nothing, and unequal in no respect, and in no part unlike, but answering exactly to Him whose image it is: where there is prime and absolute life, to whom it is not one thing to live, and another to be, but the same thing to be and to live; and prime and absolute <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, to whom it is not one thing to live, another to understand, but to understand is to live, and is to be, and all things are one: as though a perfect Word, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John 1:1</a></span> to which nothing is wanting, and a certain skill of the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> and wise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, full of all living, unchangeable sciences, and all one in it, as itself is one from one, with whom it is one. Therein God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all things which He made by it; and therefore, while times pass away and succeed, nothing passes away or succeeds to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For things which are created are not therefore <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because they have been made; and not rather have been therefore made, even although changeable, because they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unchangeably by Him. Therefore that unspeakable conjunction of the Father and His image is not without fruition, without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, without <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Therefore that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, delight, felicity, or blessedness, if indeed it can be worthily expressed by any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> word, is called by him, in short, Use; and is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in the Trinity, not begotten, but the sweetness of the begetter and of the begotten, filling all creatures according to their capacity with abundant bountifulness and copiousness, that they may keep their proper order and rest satisfied in their proper place.</p>

<p>12. Therefore all these things which are made by divine skill, show in themselves a certain unity, and form, and order; for each of them is both some one thing, as are the several natures of bodies and dispositions of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; and is fashioned in some form, as are the figures or qualities of bodies, and the various learning or skill of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; and seeks or preserves a certain order, as are the several weights or combinations of bodies and the loves or delights of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. When therefore we regard the Creator, who is understood by the things that are made  we must needs understand the Trinity of whom there appear traces in the creature, as is fitting. For in that Trinity is the supreme source of all things, and the most perfect beauty, and the most blessed delight. Those three, therefore, both seem to be mutually determined to each other, and are in themselves <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. But here in corporeal things, one thing alone is not as much as three together, and two are something more than one; but in that highest Trinity one is as much as the three together, nor are two anything more than one. And They are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in themselves. So both each are in each, and all in each, and each in all, and all in all, and all are one. Let him who sees this, whether in part, or <q>through a glass and in an enigma,</q>  <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and let him <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and give thanks; but let him who does not see it, strive to see it through <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, not to cavil at it through blindness. Since God is one, but yet is a Trinity. Neither are we to take the words, <q>of whom, and through whom, and to whom are all things,</q> as used indiscriminately [<em>i.e.</em>, to denote a unity without distinctions]; nor yet to denote many gods, for <q>to <em>Him</em>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q> </p>
