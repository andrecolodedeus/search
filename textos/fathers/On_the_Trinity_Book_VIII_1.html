<h1>On the Trinity (Book VIII)</h1>

<div class="stiki"><p>Book VIII. Piety is necessary in a Bishop, but he needs also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and dialectical skill in the face of such <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> as were rampant in Hilary's day; for the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> outdo the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> in <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and are masters in the art of devising pitfalls for the unwary reasoner (&sect;&sect; 1-3). He maintains (&sect; 4) that hitherto he has established his case; and now turns, in &sect; 5, to the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> interpretation of <em>I and the Father are One</em>, as meaning that They are one in will, not in nature. The fallacy of this is shown by a comparison of the unity of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in Christ (&sect;&sect; 7-9); a unity which is confessedly one of nature, yet is not more natural than that of Father and Son, of which it is a type (&sect; 10). And indeed the words, <em>I and the Father are One</em>, are ill-adapted to express a mere harmony of will (&sect; 11). This gift of unity of nature could not be given, as it is, through the Incarnation and the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, unless the Givers Themselves possessed it; i.e. unless Father and Son were One God (&sect;&sect; 12-14). As a matter of fact, we have a perfect union, through the mediation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, with the Father; and it is a unity of nature, a permanent abiding; an assurance to us of the indwelling of Father in Son and Son in Father, and of the fact that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not a creature, one in will with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but a Son, one in nature with Him (&sect;&sect; 15-18). For, again (&sect;&sect; 19-21), the Mission of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is jointly from the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; He is called sometimes the Spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, sometimes the Spirit of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and this is a further <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the unity in nature of Father and Son. Hilary now enquires (&sect;&sect; 22-25) into the senses in which Scripture speaks of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Sometimes this title is given to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, sometimes to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in both cases to save us from corporeal conceptions of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it is also used, in the strict sense, of the Paraclete, as on the day of Pentecost. Now the Divine Spirit dwells in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; but this Spirit, whether styled the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, or the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or the Spirit of Truth, proceeding from the Father and sent by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, is only one Spirit. Hence the Godhead is One, and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Persons within that Godhead one also (&sect;&sect; 26, 27). He next points out (&sect; 28) that the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> are inconsistent in worshipping Christ, and yet styling Him a creature; for thus they fall under the curse of the Law, and forfeit the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Again (&sect;&sect; 29-34) the powers and graces bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are described indiscriminately as gifts of one or another Person in the Godhead. The Son, therefore, as a Giver, must be one with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who is also a Giver, and one with the Spirit. There is <em>One God and One Lord </em>(&sect; 35); if we deny that the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we must also deny that the Father is Lord; which is absurd. They are One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with one Spirit, but not one Person (&sect; 36). St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> expressly says that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <em>God over all</em>; an expression which must, like all the Apostle's teaching, bear the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sense, and is incompatible with <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> (&sect;&sect; 37-39). The supporters of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> are thus alien from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (&sect; 40). After a restatement of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (&sect; 41), Hilary proceeds to deduce the Divine nature of the Son from the fact that He has been sealed by the Father (&sect;&sect; 42-45). This sealing makes Him the Father's counterpart, Whose Image He thus becomes, though in the form of a servant. If He were thus the Image of God after His Incarnation, how much more before that condescension (&sect; 46). In &sect; 47 he again denies that this teaching reduces the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> to one Person; and then (&sect;&sect; 48-50) works out the sense in which Christ is the Image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It means that They are of one nature and of one power, and that the Son is the Firstborn, through Whom all things were created. But creation and also reconciliation is the joint work of Father and Son (&sect; 51). Christ could not have stated more explicitly than He has done His unity with the Father; the recognition of this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the test of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church (&sect; 52). Heresy is blind to the essential difference between the life-giving Christ and the created <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, which owes its life to Him (&sect; 53). In Him dwells <em>the whole fullness of the Godhead bodily</em>. The Indweller and the Indwelt are Both Persons, yet are One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the whole Godhead dwells in Each (&sect;&sect; 54-56).</p></div>

<p>1. The Blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> in laying down the form for appointing a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and creating by his instructions an entirely new type of member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, has taught us in the following words the sum total of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> perfected in him:&mdash; <em>Holding fast the word according to the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that he may be able to exhort to sound doctrine and to convict gainsayers. For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330884"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse9">Titus&nbsp;1:9-10</a></span> For in this way he points out that the essentials of orderliness and morals are only profitable for good service in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> if at the same time the qualities needful for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how to teach and preserve the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are not lacking, for a man is not straightway made a good and useful <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>  by a merely innocent life or by a mere <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of preaching. For an innocent minister is profitable to himself alone unless he be instructed also; while he that is instructed has nothing to support his teaching unless he be innocent. For the words of the Apostle do not merely fit a man for his life in this world by precepts of honesty and uprightness, nor on the other hand do they educate in expertness of teaching a mere Scribe of the Synagogue for the expounding of the Law: but the Apostle is training a leader of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, perfected by the perfect accomplishment of the greatest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, so that his life may be adorned by his teaching, and his teaching by his life. Accordingly he has provided Titus, the person to whom his words were addressed, with an injunction as to the perfect practice of religion to this effect:&mdash; <em>In all things showing yourself an ensample of good works, teaching with gravity sound words that cannot be condemned, that the adversary may be ashamed, having nothing disgraceful or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to say of us</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330886"><a href="../bible/tit002.htm#verse7">Titus&nbsp;2:7-8</a></span> This teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and elect doctor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, from his consciousness of Christ who spoke and dwelt within him, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> well that the infection of tainted speech would spread abroad, and that the corruption of pestilent doctrine would furiously rage against the sound form of faithful words, and infusing the poison of its own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tenets into the inmost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, would creep on with deep-seated mischief. For it is of these that he says, <em>Whose word spreads like a cancer</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330887"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:17</a></span>, tainting the health of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, invaded by it with a secret and stealthy contagion. For this reason, he wished that there should be in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the teaching of sound words, a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and expertness in exhortation to withstand <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and false and wild gainsayings. For there are many who pretend to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but are not subject to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and rather set up a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for themselves than receive that which is given, being puffed up with the thoughts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> vanity, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the things they wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and unwilling to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things that are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; since it is a mark of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom sometimes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what we do not like. However, this will-wisdom is followed by foolish preaching, for what is foolishly learned must needs be foolishly preached. Yet how great an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to those who hear is foolish preaching, when they are misled into foolish opinions by conceit of wisdom! And for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the Apostle described them thus: <em>There are many unruly, vain talkers and deceivers</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330888"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse9">Titus&nbsp;1:9</a></span> Hence we must utter our voice against arrogant <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and boastful arrogance and seductive boastfulness&mdash;yes, we must speak against such things through the soundness of our doctrine, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the sincerity of our preaching, so that we may have the purity of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of sound doctrine.</p>

<p>2. The reason why I have just mentioned this utterance of the Apostle is this; men of crooked minds and false professions, void of hope and venomous of speech, lay upon me the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of inveighing against them, because under the guise of religion they instil deadly doctrines, infectious thoughts and corrupt desires into the simple minds of their hearers. And this they do with an utter disregard of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense of the apostolic teaching, so that the Father is not a Father, nor the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, Son, nor the Faith, the Faith. In resisting their wild falsehoods, we have extended the course of our reply so far, that after proving from the Law that God and God were distinct and that very God was in very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we then showed from the teaching of <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> the perfect and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth of the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and lastly, we pointed out in the due course of our argument that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of a nature identical with the Father's, so that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should neither confess that God is single nor that there are two Gods. For neither would the birth of God allow God to be solitary, nor would a perfect birth allow different natures to be ascribed to two Gods. Now in refuting their vain speaking we have a twofold object, first that we may teach what is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and perfect and sound, and, that our discourse should not by straying through any by-paths and crooked ways, and struggling out of devious and winding tunnels, seem rather to search for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> than declare it. Our second object is that we should reveal to the conviction of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the folly and absurdity of those crafty arguments of their vain and deceitful opinions which are adapted to a plausible show of seductive <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For it is not enough for us to have pointed out what things are good, unless they are understood to be absolutely good by our refutation of their opposites.</p>

<p>3. But as it is the nature and endeavour of the good and wise to prepare themselves wholly for securing either the reality or the opportunity of some precious hope lest their preparedness should in some respects fall short of that which they look for&mdash;so in like manner those who are filled with the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> frenzy make it their chiefest anxiety to labour with all the ingenuity of their impiety against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in order that against those who are religious they may establish their own irreligion; that they may surpass the hope of our life in the hopelessness of their own, and that they may spend more thought over false than we spend over <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> teaching. For against the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> assertions of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they have carefully devised such objections of their impious misbelief, as first to ask whether we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, next, whether Christ also be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lastly, whether the Father is greater than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in order that when they hear us confess that God is one they may use our reply to show that Christ cannot be God. For they do not enquire concerning the Son whether He be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; all they wish for in asking questions about Christ is to prove that He is not a Son, that by entrapping men of simple <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they may through the belief in one God divert them from the belief in Christ as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on the ground that God is no longer one if Christ also must be acknowledged as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Again with what subtlety of worldly wisdom do they contend when they say, If God is one, whosoever that other shall be shown to be, he will not be God. For if there be another God He can no longer be one, since nature does not permit that where there is another there should be one only, or that where there is only one there should be another. Afterwards, when by the crafty cunning of this insidious argument they have misled those who are ready to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and listen, they then apply this proposition (as if they could now establish it by an easier method), that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is God rather in name than in nature, because this generic name in Him can destroy in none that only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> belief in one God: and they contend that through this the Father is greater than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because, the natures being different, as there is but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father is greater from the essential character of His nature; and that the Other is only called Son while He is really a creature subsisting by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because He is less than the Father; and also that He is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because God being one does not admit of another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since he who is less must necessarily be of a nature alien from that of the person who is greater. Again, how foolish they are in their attempts to lay down a law for God when they maintain that no birth can take place from one single being, because throughout the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> birth arises from the union of two; moreover, that the unchangeable God cannot accord from Himself birth to one who is born, because that which is changeless is incapable of addition, nor can the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a solitary and single being contain within itself the property of generation.</p>

<p>4. We, on the contrary, having by spiritual teaching arrived at the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and following after the hope of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessedness by our confession of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and having <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> out of the Law the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without overstepping the limits of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or failing to proclaim that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have adopted this method of reply from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, that we declare the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nativity of Only-begotten God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because that through this He was both very God and not alien from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the One very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thus neither could His Godhead be denied nor Himself be described as another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because while the birth made Him <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the nature within him of one God of God did not separate Him off as another God. And although our <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reason led us to this conclusion, that the names of distinct natures could not meet together in the same nature, and not be one, where the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of each did not differ in kind; nevertheless, it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that we should prove this from the express  sayings of our Lord, Who after frequently making <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope was One, in order to affirm the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while declaring and proving His own Godhead, said, <em>I and the Father are one; </em>and, <em>If you had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me, you would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> My Father also; </em>and, <em>He that has seen Me has seen the Father also; </em>and, <em>Believe Me, that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father: or else <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> for the very works' sake</em>.  He has signified His own birth in the name <em>Father</em>, and declares that in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself the Father is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. He avows the unity of nature, when those who see Him see the Father. He bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that He is indivisible from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when He dwells in the Father Who dwells in Him. He possesses the confidence of self-<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> when He demands credit for His words from the operations of His power. And thus in this most blessed <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the perfect birth, every <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, as well that of two Gods as of a single <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is abolished, since They Who are one in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> are not one person, and He Who is not one person with Him Who is, is yet so free from difference from Him that They Two are One God.</p>

<p>5. Now seeing that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> cannot deny these things because they are so clearly stated and understood, they nevertheless pervert them by the most foolish and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> lies so as afterwards to deny them. For the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <em>I and the Father are one</em> , they endeavour to refer to a mere concord of unanimity, so that there may be in them a unity of will not of nature, that is, that they may be one not by <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of being, but by identity of will. And they apply to the support of their case the passage in the Acts of the Apostles, <em>Now of the multitude of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were one</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330891"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse32">Acts&nbsp;4:32</a></span>, in order to prove that a diversity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and hearts may be united into one heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through a mere conformity of will. Or else they cite those words to the Corinthians, <em>Now he that plants and he that waters are one</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330892"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:8</a></span>, to show that, since They are one in Their work for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and in the revelation of one <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, Their unity is an unity of wills. Or again, they quote the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of our Lord for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the nations who should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him: <em>Neither for these only do I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, but for them also that shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Me through their Word; that they all may be one; even as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in You, that they also may be in Us</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330893"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse20">John&nbsp;17:20-21</a></span>, to show that since men cannot, so to speak, be fused back into God or themselves coalesce into one undistinguished mass, this oneness must arise from unity of will, while all perform actions pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and unite one with another in the harmonious accord of their thoughts, and that thus it is not nature which makes them one, but will.</p>

<p>6. He clearly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not wisdom who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not God. And since Christ is Wisdom he must needs be beyond the pale of wisdom who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not Christ or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> Him.  As, for instance, they do who will have it that the Lord of Glory, and King of the Universe, and Only-begotten God is a creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and not His Son, and in addition to such foolish lies show a still more foolish cleverness in the defence of their <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. For even putting aside for a little that essential character of unity which exists in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, they can be refuted out of the very passages which they adduce.</p>

<p>7. For as to those whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and heart were one, I ask whether they were one through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in God? Yes, assuredly, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for through this the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and heart of all were one. Again I ask, is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> one or is there a second <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? One undoubtedly, and that on the authority of the Apostle himself, who proclaims one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> even as one Lord, and one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and one hope, and one God. <span class="stiki" id="note330895"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse4">Ephesians&nbsp;4:4-5</a></span> If then it is through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that is, through the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that all are one, how is it that thou dost not understand a natural unity in the case of those who through the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are one? For all were born again to innocence, to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of hope. And if these things cannot differ within themselves because there is both one hope and one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as also there is one Lord and one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of regeneration; if these things are one rather by agreement than by nature, ascribe a unity of will to those also who have been born again into them. If, however, they have been begotten again into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of one life and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, then, inasmuch as their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and heart are one, the unity of will fails to account for their case who are one by regeneration into the same nature.</p>

<p>8. These are not our own conjectures which we offer, nor do we <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> put together any of these things in order to deceive the ears of our hearers by perverting the meaning of words; but holding fast the form of sound teaching we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and preach the things which are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For the Apostle shows that this unity of the faithful arises from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> when he writes to the Galatians,  <em>For as many of you as were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ did put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330896"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians&nbsp;3:27-28</a></span> That these are one amid so great diversities of race, condition, sex&mdash;is it from an agreement of will or from the unity of the sacrament, since these have one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and have all put on one Christ? What, therefore, will a concord of minds avail here when they are one in that they have put on one Christ through the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>?</p>

<p>9. Or, again, since he who plants and he who waters are one, are they not one because, being themselves born again in one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> they form a ministry of one regenerating <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>? Do not they do the same thing? Are they not one in One? So they who are one through the same thing are one also by nature, not only by will, inasmuch as they themselves have been made the same thing and are ministers of the same thing and the same power.</p>

<p>10. Now the contradiction of fools always serves to prove their folly, because with regard to the faults which they contrive by the devices of an unwise or crooked understanding against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, while the latter remains unshaken and immovable the things which are opposed to it must needs be regarded as false and foolish. For <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in their attempt to deceive others by the words, <em>I and the Father are one</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330897"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span>, that there might not be acknowledged in them the unity and like <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of deity, but only a oneness arising from mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and an agreement of wills&mdash; these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, I say, have brought forward an instance of that unity, as we have shown above, even from the words of our Lord, <em>That they all may be one, as Thou Father art in Me, and I in You, that they also may be in Us</em>.  Every man is outside the promises of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> who is outside the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in them, and by the guilt of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> understanding has lost all simple hope. For to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what you believe demands not so much excuse as a reward, for the greatest service of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is to hope for that which you know not. But it is the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of most consummate <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> either not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> things which are understood or to have corrupted the sense in which one believes.</p>

<p>11. But although the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of man can pervert his intellectual powers, nevertheless the words retain their meaning. Our Lord <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> to His Father that those who shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him may be one, and as He is in the Father and the Father in Him, so all may be one in Them. Why do you bring in here an identity of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, why a unity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and heart through agreement of will? For there would have been no lack of suitable words for our Lord, if it were will that made them one, to have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in this fashion&mdash;Father, as We are one in will, so may they also be one in will, that we may all be one through agreement. Or could it be that He Who is the Word was unacquainted with the meaning of words? And that He Who is Truth <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not how to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? And He Who is Wisdom went astray in foolish talk? And He Who is Power was compassed about with such weakness that He could not speak what He wished to be understood? He has clearly spoken the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and sincere <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. And He has not only spoken that we may comprehend, He has also taught that we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, saying, <em>That they all may be one, as Thou Father art in Me, and I in You, that they also may be in Us</em>. For those first of all is the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of whom it is said, <em>That they all may be one</em>. Then the promotion of unity is set forth by a pattern of unity, when He says, <em>as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in You, that they also may be in Us</em>, so that as the Father is in the Son and the Son in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, so through the pattern of this unity all might be one in the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</p>

<p>12. But because it is proper to the Father alone and the Son that They should be one by nature because God is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Only-begotten from the Unbegotten can subsist in no other nature than that of His origin; so that He Who was begotten should exist in the substance of His birth, and the birth should possess no other and different <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of deity than that from which it issued; for our Lord has left us in no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to our belief by asserting throughout the whole of the discourse which follows the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of this complete unity. For the next words are these, <em>That the world may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that You sent Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330899"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse21">John&nbsp;17:21</a></span> Thus the world is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Son has been sent by the Father because all who shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him will be one in the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. And how they will be so we are soon told&mdash; <em>And the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which You have given Me I have given unto them</em>.  Now I ask whether <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is identical with will, since will is an emotion of the mind while <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is an ornament or embellishment of nature. So then it is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> received from the Father that the Son has given to all who shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, and certainly not will. Had this been given, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> would carry with it no reward, for a necessity of will attached to us would also impose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> upon us. However He has shown what is effected by the bestowal of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> received, <em>That they may be one, even as We are one</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330901"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;17:22</a></span> It is then with this object that the received <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was bestowed, that all might be one. So now all are one in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> given is none other than that which was received: nor has it been given for any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> than that all should be one. And since all are one through the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> given to the Son and by the Son bestowed upon <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, I ask how can the Son be of a different <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from the Father's, since the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Son brings all that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> into the unity of the Father's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Now it may be that the utterance of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> hope in this case may be somewhat immoderate, yet it will not be contrary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for though to hope for this were presumptuous, yet not to have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it is sinful, for we have one and the same Author both of our hope and of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. We will treat of this matter more clearly and at greater length in its own place, as is fitting. Yet in the meantime it is easily seen from our present argument that this hope of ours is neither vain nor presumptuous. So then through the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> received and given all are one. I hold the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and recognise the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the unity, but I do not yet understand how it is that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> given makes all one.</p>

<p>13. Now our Lord has not left the minds of His faithful followers in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, but has explained the manner in which His nature operates, saying, <em>That they may be one, as We are one: I in them and You in Me, that they may be perfected in one</em>.  Now I ask those who bring forward a unity of will between Father and Son, whether Christ is in us today through verity of nature or through agreement of will. For if in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the Word has been made flesh and we in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> receive the Word made flesh as food from the Lord, are we not bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He abides in us naturally, Who, born as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, has assumed the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of our flesh now inseparable from Himself, and has conjoined the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His own flesh to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Godhead in the sacrament by which His flesh is communicated to us? For so are we all one, because the Father is in Christ and Christ in us. Whosoever then shall deny that the Father is in Christ naturally must first deny that either he is himself in Christ naturally, or Christ in him, because the Father in Christ and Christ in us make us one in Them. Hence, if indeed Christ has taken to Himself the flesh of our body, and that Man Who was born from Mary was indeed Christ, and we indeed receive in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> the flesh of His body&mdash; (and for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> we shall be one, because the Father is in Him and He in us)&mdash;how can a unity of will be maintained, seeing that the special property of nature received through the sacrament is the sacrament of a perfect unity ?</p>

<p>14. The words in which we speak of the things of God must be used in no mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and worldly sense, nor must the perverseness of an alien and impious interpretation be extorted from the soundness of heavenly words by any violent and headstrong preaching. Let us read what is written, let us understand what we read, and then fulfil the demands of a perfect <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For as to what we say concerning the reality of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> nature within us, unless we have been taught by Him, our words are foolish and impious. For He says Himself, <em>My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed. He that eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330904"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse55">John&nbsp;6:55-56</a></span> As to the verity of the flesh and blood there is no room left for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. For now both from the declaration of the Lord Himself and our own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it is verily flesh and verily blood. And these when eaten and drunk, bring it to pass that both we are in Christ and Christ in us. Is not this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>? Yet they who affirm that Christ Jesus is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> God are welcome to find it false. He therefore Himself is in us through the flesh and we in Him, while together with Him our own selves are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>15. Now how it is that we are in Him through the sacrament of the flesh and blood bestowed upon us, He Himself testifies, saying, <em>And the world will no longer see Me, but you shall see Me; because I live you shall live also; because I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you</em>.  If He wished to indicate a mere unity of will, why did He set forth a kind of gradation and sequence in the completion of the unity, unless it were that, since He was in the Father through the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Deity, and we on the contrary in Him through His birth in the body, He would have us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is in us through the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>? And thus there might be taught a perfect unity through a Mediator, while, we abiding in Him, He abode in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and as abiding in the Father abode also in us; and so we might arrive at unity with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, since in Him Who dwells naturally in the Father by birth, we also dwell naturally, while He Himself abides naturally in us also.</p>

<p>16. Again, how natural this unity is in us He has Himself testified on this wise&mdash; <em>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330906"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse56">John&nbsp;6:56</a></span> For no man shall dwell in Him, save him in whom He dwells Himself, for the only flesh which He has taken to Himself is the flesh of those who have taken His. Now He had already taught before the sacrament of this perfect unity, saying, <em>As the living Father sent Me, and I live through the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, so he that eats My flesh shall himself also live through Me</em>.  So then He lives through the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and as He lives through the Father in like manner we live through His flesh. For all comparison is chosen to shape our understanding, so that we may grasp the subject of which we treat by help of the analogy set before us. This is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our life that we have Christ dwelling within our carnal selves through the flesh, and we shall live through Him in the same manner as He lives through the Father. If, then, we live naturally through Him according to the flesh, that is, have partaken of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His flesh, must He not naturally have the Father within Himself according to the Spirit since He Himself lives through the Father? And He lives through the Father because His birth has not implanted in Him an alien and different nature inasmuch as His very being is from Him yet is not divided from Him by any barrier of an unlikeness of nature, for within Himself He has the Father through the birth in the power of the nature.</p>

<p>17. I have dwelt upon these facts because the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> maintain that the union between Father and Son is one of will only, and make use of the example of our own union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as though we were united to the Son and through the Son to the Father by mere <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> and a devout will, and none of the natural verity of communion were vouchsafed us through the sacrament of the Body and Blood; although the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Son bestowed upon us through the Son abiding in us after the flesh, while we are united in Him corporeally and inseparably, bids us preach the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and natural unity.</p>

<p>18. So we have made our reply to the folly of our violent opponents, merely to prove the emptiness of their falsehoods and so prevent them from misleading the unwary by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of their vain and foolish statements. But the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> did not of necessity require our answer. The Lord <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> on our behalf for our union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but God keeps His own unity and abides in it. It is not through any <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> appointment of God that they are one, but through a birth of nature, for God loses nothing in begetting Him from Himself. They are one, for the things which are not plucked out of His hand are not plucked out of the hand of the Father <span class="stiki" id="note330908"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;10:28-29</a></span>, for, when He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, the Father is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, for, when He is seen, the Father is seen, for what He speaks the Father speaks as abiding in Him, for in His works the Father works, for He is in the Father and the Father in Him.  This proceeds from no creation but from birth; it is not brought about by will but by power; it is no agreement of mind that speaks, it is nature; because to be created and to be born are not one and the same, any more than to will and to be able; neither is it the same thing to agree and to abide.</p>

<p>19. Thus we do not deny a unanimity between the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>&mdash;for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are accustomed to utter this <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, that since we do not accept concord by itself as the bond of unity we declare Them to be at variance. But let them listen how it is that we do not deny such a unanimity. The Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are one in nature, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, power, and the same nature cannot will things that are contrary. Moreover, let them listen to the testimony of the Son as touching the unity of nature between Himself and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for He says, <em>When that advocate has come, Whom I shall send to you from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> Who proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He shall testify of Me</em>.  The Advocate shall come and the Son shall send Him from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and He is the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> Who proceeds from the Father. Let the whole following of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> arouse the keenest powers of their wit; let them now seek for what lies they can tell to the unlearned, and declare what that is which the Son sends from the Father. He Who sends manifests His power in that which He sends. But as to that which He sends from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, how shall we regard it, as received or sent forth or begotten? For His words that He will <em>send from the Father </em>must imply one or other of these modes of sending. And He will send from the Father that Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which proceeds from the Father; He therefore cannot be the Recipient, since He is revealed as the Sender. It only remains to make sure of our conviction on the point, whether we are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> an egress of a co-existent Being, or a procession of a Being begotten.</p>

<p>20. For the present I forbear to expose their licence of speculation, some of them holding that the Paraclete Spirit comes from the Father or from the Son. For our Lord has not left this in uncertainty, for after these same words He spoke thus&mdash; <em>I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now. When He, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, has come, He shall guide you into all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: for He shall not speak from Himself: but what things soever He shall hear, these shall He speak; and He shall declare unto you the things that are to come. He shall glorify Me: for He shall receive of Mine and shall declare it unto you. All things whatsoever the Father has are Mine: therefore said I, He shall receive of Mine and shall declare it unto you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330911"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;16:12-15</a></span> Accordingly He receives from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, Who is both sent by Him, and proceeds from the Father. Now I ask whether to receive from the Son is the same thing as to proceed from the Father. But if one believes that there is a difference between receiving from the Son and proceeding from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, surely to receive from the Son and to receive from the Father will be regarded as one and the same thing. For our Lord Himself says, <em>Because He shall receive of Mine and shall declare it unto you. All things whatsoever the Father has are Mine: therefore said I, He shall receive of Mine and shall declare it unto you</em>. That which He will receive&mdash;whether it will be power, or excellence, or teaching&mdash;the Son has said must be received from Him, and again He indicates that this same thing must be received from the Father. For when He says that all things whatsoever the Father has are His, and that for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> He declared that it must be received from His own, He teaches also that what is received from the Father is yet received from Himself, because all things that the Father has are His. Such a unity admits no difference, nor does it make any difference from whom that is received, which given by the Father is described as given by the Son. Is a mere unity of will brought forward here also? All things which the Father has are the Son's, and all things which the Son has are the Father's. For He Himself says, <em>And all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine</em>.  It is not yet the place to show why He spoke thus, <em>For He shall receive of Mine: </em>for this points to some subsequent time, when it is revealed that He shall receive. Now at any rate He says that He will receive of Himself, because all things that the Father had were His. Dissever if you can the unity of the nature, and introduce some necessary unlikeness through which the Son may not exist in unity of nature. For the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> proceeds from the Father and is sent from the Father by the Son. All things that the Father has are the Son's; and for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whatever He Who is to be sent shall receive, He shall receive from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because all things that the Father has are the Son's. The nature in all respects maintains its law, and because Both are One that same Godhead is signified as existing in Both through generation and nativity; since the Son affirms that that which the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall receive from the Father is to be given by Himself. So the frowardness of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> must not be allowed an unchecked licence of impious beliefs, in refusing to acknowledge that this saying of the Lord,&mdash; that because all things which the Father has are His, therefore the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall receive of Him&mdash;is to be referred to unity of nature.</p>

<p>21. Let us listen to that chosen vessel and teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, when he had already commended the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the people of Rome because of their understanding of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For wishing to teach the unity of nature in the case of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, he speaks thus, <em>But you are not in the flesh but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, if indeed the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> is in you. But if any have not the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he is none of His. But if Christ is in you, the body indeed is dead through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but the Spirit is life through righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him Who raised up Christ from the dead dwells in you; He Who raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies, because of His Spirit Who dwells in you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330913"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;8:9-11</a></span> We are all spiritual if the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwells in us. But this <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> is also the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and though the Spirit of Christ is in us, yet His Spirit is also in us Who raised Christ from the dead, and He Who raised Christ from the dead shall quicken our mortal bodies also on account of His Spirit that dwells in us. We are quickened therefore on account of the Spirit of Christ that dwells in us, through Him Who raised Christ from the dead. And since the Spirit of Him Who raised Christ from the dead dwells in us, and yet the Spirit of Christ is in us, nevertheless the Spirit Which is in us cannot but be the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. Separate, then, O <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, the Spirit of Christ from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and the Spirit of Christ raised from the dead from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> Which raises Christ from the dead; when the Spirit of Christ that dwells in us is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and when the Spirit of Christ Who was raised from the dead is yet the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> Who raises Christ from the dead.</p>

<p>22. And now I ask whether you think that in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of God is signified a nature or a property belonging to a nature. For a nature is not identical with a thing belonging to it, just as neither is a man identical with what belongs to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor fire with what belongs to fire itself, and in like manner God is not the same as that which belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>23. For I am aware that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is revealed under the title <em><a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> </em>in order that we may understand the presence of the Father in Him, and that the term <em><a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> </em>may be employed to indicate Either, and that this is shown not only on the authority of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> but of <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> also, when it is said, <em>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is upon Me; therefore He has anointed Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330914"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;4:18</a></span> And again, <em>Behold My Servant Whom I have chosen, My beloved in Whom My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is well pleased, I will put My Spirit upon Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330915"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;12:18</a></span> And when the Lord Himself bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Himself, <em>But if I in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of God cast out devils, then has the kingdom of God come upon you</em>.  For the passages seem without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to denote either Father or Son, while they yet manifest the excellence of nature.</p>

<p>24. For I think that the expression '<a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>' was used with respect to Each, lest we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Son was present in the Father or the Father in the Son in a merely corporeal manner, that is, lest God might be thought to abide in one position and exist nowhere else apart from Himself. For a man or any other thing like him, when he is in one place, cannot be in another, because what is in one place is confined to the place where it is: his nature cannot allow him to be everywhere when he exists in some one position. But God is a living Force, of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power, present everywhere and nowhere absent, and manifests His whole self through His own, and signifies that His own are naught else than Himself, so that where they are He may be understood to be Himself. Yet we must not think that, after a corporeal fashion, when He is in one place He ceases to be everywhere, for through His own things He is still present in all places, while the things which are His are none other than His own self. Now these things have been said to make us understand what is meant by 'nature.'</p>

<p>25. Now I think that it ought to be clearly understood that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is denoted by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> declared that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> was upon Him since He anoints Him and sends Him to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For in Him is made manifest the excellence of the Father's nature, disclosing that the Son partakes of His nature even when born in the flesh through the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of this spiritual unction, since after the birth ratified in His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> this intimation of His inherent Sonship was heard as a voice bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>:&mdash; <em>You are My Son; this day have I begotten You</em>.  For not even He Himself can be understood as resting upon Himself or coming to Himself from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, or as bestowing on Himself the title of Son: but all this demonstration was for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in order that under the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of a complete and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth we should recognise that the unity of the nature dwells in the Son Who had begun to be also man. We have thus found that in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is designated; but we understand that the Son is indicated in the same way, when He says: <em>But if I in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of God cast out devils, then has the kingdom of God come upon you</em>. That is, He shows clearly that He, by the power of His nature, casts out devils, which cannot be cast out save by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. The phrase '<a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>' denotes also the Paraclete Spirit, and that not only on the testimony of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> but also of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, when it is said:&mdash; <em>This is that which was spoken through the Prophet, It shall come to pass on the last day, says the Lord, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh, and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330918"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse16">Acts&nbsp;2:16-17</a></span> And we learn that all this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> was fulfilled in the case of the Apostles, when, after the sending of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, they all spoke with the tongues of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</p>

<p>26. Now we have of necessity set these things forth with this object, that in whatever direction the deception of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> betakes itself, it might yet be kept in check by the boundaries and limits of the gospel <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For Christ dwells in us, and where Christ dwells God dwells. And when the Spirit of Christ dwells in us, this indwelling means not that any other Spirit dwells in us than the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. But if it is understood that Christ dwells in us through the Holy Spirit, we must yet recognise this <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> as also the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And since the nature dwells in us as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of one substantive Being, we must regard the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Son as identical with that of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> Who is both the Spirit of Christ and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be a Being of one nature. I ask now, therefore, how can They fail to be one by nature? The Spirit of Truth proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He is sent by the Son and receives from the Son. But all things that the Father has are the Son's, and for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> He Who receives from Him is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> but at the same time the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The Spirit is a Being of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Son but the same Being is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Father. He is the Spirit of Him Who raised Christ from the dead; but this is no other than the Spirit of Christ Who was so raised. The nature of Christ and of God must differ in some respect so as not to be the same, if it can be shown that the Spirit which is of God is not the Spirit of Christ also.</p>

<p>27. But you, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, as you wildly rave and are driven about by the Spirit of your deadly doctrine the Apostle seizes and constrains, establishing Christ for us as the foundation of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, being well aware also of that saying of our Lord, <em>If a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Me, he will also keep My word; and My Father will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330919"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;14:23</a></span> For by this He testified that while the Spirit of Christ abides in us the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> abides in us, and that the Spirit of Him that was raised from the dead differs not from the Spirit of Him that raised Him from the dead. For they come and dwell in us: and I ask whether they will come as aliens associated together and make Their abode, or in unity of nature? Nay, the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> contends that it is not two Spirits&mdash; the Spirits of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of Christ&mdash; that are present in those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but the Spirit of Christ which is also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. This is no joint indwelling, it is one indwelling: yet an indwelling under the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> semblance of a joint indwelling, for it is not the case that two Spirits indwell, nor is one that indwells different from the other. For there is in us the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> and there is also in us the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and when the Spirit of Christ is in us there is also in us the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. And so since what is of God is also of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and what is of Christ is also of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Christ cannot be anything different from what God is. Christ, therefore, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one Spirit with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>28. Now the Apostle asserts that those words in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <em>I and the Father are one</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330920"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span>, imply unity of nature and not a solitary single Being, as he writes to the Corinthians, <em>Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of God calls Jesus <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330921"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:3</a></span> Perceivest thou now, O <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, in what spirit you call Christ a creature? For since they are under a curse who have served the creature more than the Creator&mdash; in affirming Christ to be a creature, learn what you are, since you know full well that the worship of the creature is accursed. And observe what follows, <em>And no one can call Jesus Lord, but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330922"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:3</a></span> Do you perceive what is lacking to you, when you deny Christ what is His own? If you hold that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is Lord through His Divine nature, you have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But if He be Lord merely by a name of adoption you lack the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and art animated by a spirit of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>: because no one can call Jesus Lord, but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But when you say that He is a creature rather than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although you style Him Lord, still thou dost not say that He is the Lord. For to you He is Lord as one of a common class and by a familiar name, rather than by nature. Yet learn from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> His nature.</p>

<p>29. For the Apostle goes on to say, <em>Now there are diversities of gifts, but there is the same Spirit; and there are diversities of ministrations but one and the same Lord; and there are diversities of workings but the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who works all things in all. But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for that which profits</em>.  In this passage before us we perceive a fourfold statement: in the diversity of gifts it is the same Spirit, in the diversity of ministrations it is the very same Lord, in the diversity of workings it is the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the bestowal of that which is profitable there is a manifestation of the Spirit. And in order that the bestowal of what is profitable might be recognised in the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he continues: <em>To one indeed is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> according to the same Spirit; to another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the same Spirit; to another the gift of healing in the same Spirit; to another the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; to another <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; to another discerning of spirits; to another kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues</em>. </p>

<p>30. And indeed that which we called the fourth statement, that is the manifestation of the Spirit in the bestowal of what is profitable, has a clear meaning. For the Apostle has enumerated the profitable gifts through which this manifestation of the Spirit took place. Now in these diverse activities that Gift is set forth in no uncertain light of which our Lord had spoken to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> when He taught them <em>not to depart from Jerusalem; but wait, said He, for the promise of the Father which you heard from My lips: for John indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water, but you shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which you shall also receive not many days hence</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330925"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;1:4-5</a></span> And again: <em>But you shall receive power when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> comes upon you; and you shall be My witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Jud&aelig;a, and in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and unto the uttermost part of the earth</em>.  He bids them wait for the promise of the Father of which they had heard from His lips. We may be sure that here  we have a reference to the Father's same promise. Hence it is by these miraculous workings that the manifestation of the Spirit takes place. For the gift of the Spirit is manifest, where wisdom makes utterance and the words of life are heard, and where there is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that comes of God-given insight, lest after the fashion of beasts through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of God we should fail to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Author of our life; or by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lest by not believing the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we should be outside His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; or by the gift of healings, that by the cure of diseases we should bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> Who bestows these things; or by the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, that what we do may be understood to be the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or by prophesy, that through our understanding of doctrine we might be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be taught of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; or by discerning of spirits, that we should not be unable to tell whether any one speaks with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> or a perverted spirit; or by kinds of tongues, that the speaking in tongues may be bestowed as a sign of the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; or by the interpretation of tongues, that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those that hear may not be imperilled through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, since the interpreter of a tongue explains the tongue to those who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it. Thus in all these things distributed to each one to profit withal there is the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the gift of the Spirit being apparent through these marvellous advantages bestowed upon each.</p>

<p>31. Now the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> in revealing the secret of these heavenly <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, most difficult to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> comprehension, has preserved a clear enunciation and a carefully worded caution in order to show that these diverse gifts are given through the Spirit and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> (for to be given through the Spirit and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is not the same thing), because the granting of a gift which is exercised in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is yet bestowed through the Spirit. But he sums up these diversities of gifts thus: <em>Now all these things works one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one as He will</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330928"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:11</a></span> Now, therefore, I ask what Spirit works these things, dividing to each one according as He wills: is it He by Whom or He in Whom there is this distribution of gifts ? But if any one shall dare to say that it is the same Person which is indicated, the Apostle will refute so faulty an opinion, for he says above, <em>And there are diversities of workings, but the same God Who works all things in all</em>. So there is one Who distributes and another in Whom the distribution is vouchsafed. Yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is always God Who works all these things, but in such a way that Christ works, and the Son in His working performs the Father's work. And if in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> you confess Jesus to be Lord, understand the force of that threefold indication in the Apostle's letter; forasmuch as in the diversities of gifts, it is the same Spirit, and in the diversities of ministrations it is the same Lord, and in the diversities of workings it is the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and again, one Spirit that works all things distributing to each according as He will. And grasp the idea if you can that the Lord in the distribution of ministrations, and God in the distribution of workings, are this one and the same Spirit Who both works and distributes as He will; because in the distribution of gifts there is one Spirit, and the same Spirit works and distributes.</p>

<p>32. But if this one Spirit of one Divinity, one in both God and Lord through the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the birth, does not please you, then point out to me what Spirit both works and distributes these diverse gifts to us, and in what Spirit He does this. But, you must show me nothing but what accords with our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because the Apostle shows us Who is to be understood, saying, <em>For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330930"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:12</a></span> He affirms that diversities of gifts come from one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Who is the body of all. Because after he had made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Lord in ministration, and made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> also God in workings, he yet shows that one Spirit both works and distributes all these things, distributing  these varieties of His gracious gifts for the perfecting of one body.</p>

<p>33. Unless perchance we think that the Apostle did not keep to the principle of unity in that he said, <em>And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord, and there are diversities of workings, but the same God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330931"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:5-6</a></span> So that because he referred ministrations to the Lord and workings to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he does not appear to have understood one and the same Being in ministrations and operations. Learn how these members which minister are also members which work, when he says, <em>You are the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and of Him members indeed. For God has set some in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, first <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a></em>, in whom is the word of wisdom; <em>secondly <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a></em>, in whom is the gift of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; <em>thirdly teachers</em>, in whom is the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; <em>next mighty works</em>, among which are the <em>healing of diseases, the power to help, governments </em>by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and gifts of either speaking or interpreting <em>various kinds of tongues</em>. Clearly these are the Church's agents of ministry and work of whom the body of Christ consists; and God has ordained them. But perhaps you maintain that they have not been ordained by Christ, because it was God Who ordained them. But you shall hear what the Apostle says himself: <em>Now to each one of us was the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given according to the measure of the gift of Christ</em>. And again, <em>He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things. And he gave some to be <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; and some, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and some, <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, for the work of ministering</em>.  Are not then the gifts of ministration Christ's, while they are also the gifts of God?</p>

<p>34. But if impiety has assumed to itself that because he says, <em>The same Lord and the same God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330933"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:5-6</a></span>, they are not in unity of nature, I will support this interpretation with what you deem still stronger arguments. For the same Apostle says, <em>But for us there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of Whom are all things, and we in Him, and one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, through Whom are all things, and we through Him</em>.  And again, <em>One Lord, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, one God and Father of all, Who is both through all, and in us all</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330935"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;4:5-6</a></span> By these words <em>one God </em>and <em>one Lord </em>it would seem that to God only is attributed, as to one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the property of being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since the property of oneness does not admit of partnership with another. Verily how rare and hard to attain are such spiritual gifts! How <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is the manifestation of the Spirit seen in the bestowal of such useful gifts! And with reason has this order in the distribution of graces been appointed, that the foremost should be the word of wisdom; for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> it is, <em>And no one can call Jesus Lord but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note330936"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:3</a></span>, because but through this word of wisdom Christ could not be understood to be Lord; that then there should follow next the word of understanding, that we might speak with understanding what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the word of wisdom; and that the third gift should consist of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, seeing that those leading and higher graces would be unprofitable gifts did we not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So that in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense of this greatest and most noble utterance of the Apostle no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> possess either the word of wisdom or the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of religion, inasmuch as wilful <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, being incapable of understanding, is void of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the word and of genuineness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For no one utters what he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; nor can he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that which he cannot utter; and thus when the Apostle preached one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselyte</a> as He was from the Law, and called to the gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he has attained to the confession of a perfect <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And lest the simplicity of a seemingly unguarded statement might afford <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> any opportunity for denying through the preaching of one God the birth of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the Apostle has set forth one God while indicating His peculiar attribute in these words, <em>One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of Whom are all things, and we in Him</em> , in order that He Who is God might also be acknowledged as Father. Afterwards, inasmuch as this bare belief in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father would not suffice for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, he added, <em>And one, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, through Whom are all things, and we through Him</em>, showing that the purity of saving <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> consists in the preaching of one God and one Lord, so that we might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> full well how our Lord had said, <em>For this is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of My Father, that every one that sees the Son and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Him should have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330938"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse40">John&nbsp;6:40</a></span> But in fixing the order of the Church's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and basing our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> upon the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, he has uttered the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of that indivisible and indissoluble unity and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the words <em>one God and one Lord.</em></p>

<p>35. First of all, then, O <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> that hast no part in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> which spoke by the Apostle, learn your folly. If you wrongly employest the confession of one God to deny the Godhead of Christ, on the ground that where one God exists He must be regarded as solitary, and that to be One is characteristic and peculiar to Him Who is One&mdash;what sense will you assign to the statement that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is one Lord? For if, as you assert, the fact that the Father alone is God has not left to Christ the possibility of Godhead, it must needs be also according to you that the fact of Christ being one Lord does not leave God the possibility of being Lord, seeing that you will have it that to be One must be the essential property of Him Who is One. Hence if you deny that the one Lord Christ is also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you must needs deny that the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is also Lord. And what will the greatness of God amount to if He be not Lord, and the power of the Lord if He be not God: since it (viz., the greatness or power) causes that to be God which is Lord, and makes that Lord which is God?</p>

<p>36. Now the Apostle, maintaining the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense of the Lord's saying, <em>I and the Father are one</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330939"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span>, while He asserts that Both are One, signifies that Both are One not after the manner of the soleness of a single being, but in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; for one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and one Christ the Lord, since Each is both Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do not yet admit in our creed either two Gods or two Lords. So then Each is one, and though one, neither is sole. We shall not be able to express the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> except in the words of the Apostle. For there is one God and one Lord, and the fact that there is one God and one Lord proves that there is at once Lordship in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Godhead in the Lord. You can not maintain a union of person, so making God single; nor yet can you divide the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, so preventing the Two from being One.  Nor in the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> and one Lord will you be able to separate the power, so that He Who is Lord should not also be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and He Who is God should not also be Lord. For the Apostle in the enunciation of the Names has taken care not to preach either two Gods or two Lords. And for this reason he has employed such a method of teaching as in the one Lord Christ to set forth also one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father to set forth also one Lord. And, not to misguide us into the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> that God is solitary, which would destroy the birth of the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he has confessed both Father and Christ.</p>

<p>37. Unless perchance the frenzy of utter desperation will venture to rush to such lengths that, inasmuch as the Apostle has called Christ Lord, no one ought to acknowledge Him as anything else save Lord, and that because He has the property of Lord He has not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead. But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> full well that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for he says, <em>Whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ, Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over all</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330941"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;9:5</a></span> It is no creature here who is reckoned as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nay, it is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of things created Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over all.</p>

<p>38. Now that He Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over all is also Spirit inseparable from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, learn also from that very utterance of the Apostle, of which we are now speaking. For when he confessed one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father from Whom are all things, and one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> through Whom are all things; what difference, I ask, did he intend by saying that all things are from God and that all things are through Christ? Can He possibly be regarded as of a nature and spirit separable from Himself, He from Whom and through Whom are all things? For all things have come into being through the Son out of nothing, and the Apostle has referred them to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <em>From Whom are all things, </em>but also to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <em>through Whom are all things</em>. And I find here no difference, since by Each is exercised the same power. For if with regard to the subsistence of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> it was an exact sufficient statement that things created are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what need was there to state that the things which are from God are through Christ, unless it be one and the same thing to be through Christ and from God? But as it has been ascribed to Each of Them that They are Lord and God in such wise that each title belongs to Both, so too <em>from Whom </em>and <em>through Whom </em>is here referred to Both; and this to show the unity of Both, not to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> God's singleness. The language of the Apostle affords no opening for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, nor is his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> too exalted for careful statement. For he has guarded himself by those specially appropriate words from being understood to mean two Gods or a solitary God: for while he rejects oneness of person he yet does not divide the unity of Godhead. For this <em>from Whom are all things and through Whom are all things</em>, although it did not posit a solitary Deity in the sole possession of majesty, must yet set forth One not different in efficiency, since <em>from Whom are all things </em>and <em>through Whom are all things </em>must signify an Author of the same nature engaged in the same work. He affirms, moreover, that Each is properly of the same nature. For after announcing the depth of the riches and wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and after asserting the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His inscrutable judgments and avowing our <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of His ways past finding out, he has yet made use of the exercise of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and rendered this homage to the depth of the unsearchable and inscrutable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of heaven, <em>For of Him and through Him and in Him are all things: to Him be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330942"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse36">Romans&nbsp;11:36</a></span> He employs to indicate the one nature, that which cannot but be the work of one nature.</p>

<p>39. For whereas he has specially ascribed to God that all things are from Him, and he has assigned as a peculiar property to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that all things are through Him, and it is now the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God that from Him and through Him and in Him are all things; and whereas the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> is the same as the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or whereas in the ministration of the Lord and in the working of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one Spirit both works and divides, They cannot but be one Whose properties are those of one; since in the same Lord the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and in the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, one and the same Spirit distributing in the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> accomplishes all things. How worthy is this saint of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of exalted and heavenly <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, adopted and chosen to share in the secret things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, preserving a due silence over things which may not be uttered, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> apostle of Christ! How by the announcement of his clear teaching has he restrained the imaginations of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wilfulness, confessing, as he does, one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, so that meanwhile no one can either preach two Gods or one solitary <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; although He Who is not one person cannot multiply into two Gods, nor on the other hand can They Who are not two Gods be understood to be one single person; while meantime the revelation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as Father demonstrates the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nativity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>40. Thrust out now your quivering and hissing tongues, you vipers of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, whether it be thou Sabellius or thou Photinus, or ye who now preach that the Only-begotten God is a creature. Whosoever denies the Son shall hear of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because inasmuch as a father becomes a father only by having a son, this name Father necessarily connotes the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the Son. And again, let him who takes away from the Son the unity of an identical nature, acknowledge one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. For unless through unity of the Spirit He is one Lord room will not be left for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father to be Lord. Again, let him who holds the Son to have become Son in time and by His Incarnation, learn that through Him are all things and we through Him, and that His timeless Infinity was creating all things before time was. And meanwhile let him read again that there is one hope of our calling, and one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; if, after that, he oppose himself to the preaching of the Apostle, he, being accursed because he framed <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">strange doctrines</a> of his own device, is neither called nor <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> nor believing; because in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and in one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> there lies the one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of one hope and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And no alien doctrine can boast that it has a place among the truths which belong to one God and Lord and hope and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>41. So then the one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is, to confess the Father in the Son and the Son in the Father through the unity of an indivisible nature, not confused but inseparable, not intermingled but identical, not conjoined but coexisting, not incomplete but perfect. For there is birth not separation, there is a Son not an adoption; and He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not a creature. Neither is He a God of a different kind, but the Father and Son are one: for the nature was not altered by birth so as to be alien from the property of its original. So the Apostle holds the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Son abiding in the Father and the Father in the Son when he proclaims that for him there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> the Father and one Lord Christ, since in Christ the Lord there was also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father there was also Lord, and They Two are that unity which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and They Two are also that unity which is the Lord, for reason indicates that there must be something imperfect in God unless He be Lord, and in the Lord unless He were God. And so since Both are one, and Both are implied under either name, and neither exists apart from the unity, the Apostle has not gone beyond the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in his teaching, nor does Christ when He speaks in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> differ from the words which He spoke while abiding in the world in bodily form.</p>

<p>42. For the Lord had said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a>, <em>Work not for the meat which perishes, but for the meat which abides unto life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> shall give unto you: for Him the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, even <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has sealed. They said therefore unto Him, What must we do that we may work the works of God? And He said unto them, This is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him Whom He has sent</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330943"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;6:27-29</a></span> In setting forth the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His Incarnation and His Godhead our Lord has also uttered the teaching of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope that we should work for food, not that which perishes but that which abides for ever; that we should remember that this food of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is given us by the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>; that we should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> as sealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father; that we should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him Whom He has sent. And Who is it Whom the Father has sent? Even He Whom the Father has sealed. And Who is He Whom the Father has sealed? In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, even He who gives the food of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. And further who are they to whom He gives it? They who shall work for the food that does not perish. Thus, then, the work for this food is at the same time the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him Whom He has sent. But these words are uttered by the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>. And how shall the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> give the food of life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>? Why, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, bestowing food unto life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, has been sealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. At this point I now ask in what sense are we to understand that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> has been sealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father?</p>

<p>43. Now we ought to recognise first of all that God has spoken not for Himself but for us, and that He has so far tempered the language of His utterance as to enable the weakness of our nature to grasp and understand it. For after being rebuked by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for having made Himself the equal of God by professing to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, He had answered that He Himself did all things that the Father did, and that He had received all judgment from the Father; moreover that He must be honoured even as the Father. And in all these things having before declared Himself Son, He had made Himself equal to the Father in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, power and nature. Afterwards He had said that as the Father had life in Himself, so He had given the Son to have life in Himself, wherein He signified that by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the birth He possessed the unity of the same nature. For when He says that He has what the Father has, He means that He has the Father's self. For that God is not after <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fashion of a composite being, so that in Him there is a difference of kind between Possessor and Possessed; but all that He is is life, a nature, that is, complete, absolute and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, not composed of dissimilar elements but with one life permeating the whole. And since this life was in such wise given as it was possessed, although the fact that it was given manifestly reveals the birth of the Recipient, it yet does not involve a difference of kind since the life given was such as was possessed.</p>

<p>44. Therefore after this manifold and precise revelation of the presence of the Father's nature in Himself, He goes on to say, <em>For Him has the Father sealed, even God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330944"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;6:27</a></span> It is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a seal to exhibit the whole form of the figure graven upon it, and that an impression taken from it reproduces it in every respect; and since it receives the whole of that which is impressed, it displays also in itself wholly whoever has been impressed upon it. Yet this comparison is not adequate to exemplify the Divine birth, because in seals there is a matter, difference of nature, and an act of impression, whereby the likeness of stronger natures is impressed upon things of a more yielding nature. But the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who was also through the Mystery of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, desiring to point out to us the likeness of His Father's proper nature in Himself, said that He was sealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> was about to give the food of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and that we thereby might perceive in Him the power of giving food unto <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, in that He possessed within Himself all the fullness of His Father's form, even of the God Who sealed Him: so that what God had sealed should display in itself none other than the form of the God Who sealed it. These things indeed the Lord spoke to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who could not receive His saying because of unbelief.</p>

<p>45. But in us the preacher of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> by the Spirit of Christ Who spoke through him, instils the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this His proper nature when he says, <em>Who, being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thought it not a thing to grasp at that He was equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant</em>.  For He, Whom God had sealed, could be naught else than the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that which has been sealed in the form of God must needs present at the same time imaged forth within itself all that God possesses. And for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the Apostle taught that He Whom God sealed is God abiding in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For when about to speak of the Mystery of the body assumed and born in Him, he says, <em>He thought it not a thing to grasp at that He was equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant</em>.  As regards His being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by virtue of God's seal upon Him, he still remained God. But inasmuch as He was to take the form of a servant and become <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> unto death, not grasping at His equality with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He emptied Himself through <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to take the form of a slave. And He emptied Himself of the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, of that wherein He was equal with God&mdash; not that He regarded His equality with God as any encroachment,&mdash; although He was in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and equal with God and sealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>46. At this point I ask whether He Who abides as God in the form of God is a God of another kind, as we perceive in the case of seals in respect of the likenesses which stamp and those which are stamped, since a steel die impressed upon lead or a gem upon wax shapes the figure cut in it or imprints that which stands in relief upon it. But if there be any one so foolish and senseless as to think that that, pertaining to Himself, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> fashions to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is anything but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that He Who is in the form of God is in any respect anything else save God after the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His Incarnation and of His humility, made perfect through <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> even unto the death of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, he shall hear, by the confession of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth and of every tongue, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. If then, when His form had become that of a slave He abides in such <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, how, I ask, did He abide when in the form of God? Must not Christ the Spirit have been in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Gods&mdash; for this is what is meant by 'in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God'&mdash; when Christ as Jesus, that is, born as man, exists in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father?</p>

<p>47. In all things the blessed Apostle preserves the unchangeable teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is proclaimed as God in such wise that neither does the Apostle's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by calling Him a God of a different order, fall away to the confession of two Gods, nor by making God the Son inseparable from the Father does it leave an opening for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> doctrine of a single and solitary God. For when he says, <em>in the form of God </em>and <em>in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father </em>the Apostle neither teaches that They differ one from another, nor allows us to think of Him as not existing. For He Who is in the form of God neither ends by becoming another God nor Himself loses His Godhead: for He cannot be severed from the form of God since He exists in it, nor is He, Who is in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not God Just as He Who is in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God cannot be anything else than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, since He is God in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot be proclaimed as another god and one different from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeing that by reason of the fact that He is in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God He possesses naturally from Him in Whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> He is, the property of divinity.</p>

<p>48. But there is no danger that the one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will cease to be such through diversity in its preaching. The Evangelist had taught that our Lord said, <em>He that has seen Me, has seen the Father also</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330947"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;14:9</a></span> But has <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, forgotten or kept back the meaning of the Lord's words, when he says, <em>Who is the image of the invisible God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330948"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse15">Colossians&nbsp;1:15</a></span> <em>? </em>I ask whether He is the visible likeness of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and whether the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> God can also be presented to view under the likeness of a finite form? For a likeness must needs repeat the form of that of which it is the likeness. Let those, however, who will have a nature of a different sort in the Son determine what sort of likeness of the invisible God they wish the Son to be. Is it a bodily likeness exposed to the gaze, and moving from place to place with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> gait and motion? Nay, but let them remember that according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and the Prophets both Christ is a Spirit and God is a Spirit. If they confine this Christ the Spirit within the bounds of shape and body, such a corporeal Christ will not be the likeness of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor will a finite limitation represent that which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.</p>

<p>49. But, as it is, neither did the Lord leave us in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>: <em>He who has seen Me, has seen the Father also; </em>nor was the Apostle silent as to His nature, <em>Who is the image of the invisible God. </em>For the Lord had said, <em>If I do not the works of My Father, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me not</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330949"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;10:37</a></span>, teaching them to see the Father in Himself in that He did the works of the Father; that through perceiving the power of His nature they might understand the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that power which they perceived. Wherefore the Apostle proclaiming that this is the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, says, <em>Who is the image of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of all creation; for in Him were all things made in the heavens and upon the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through Him and in Him, and He is before all, and for Him all things consist. And He is the head of the body, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Who is the beginning, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> from the dead, that in all things He might have the pre-eminence. For it was the good pleasure of the Father that in Him should all the fullness dwell, and through Him all things should be reconciled to Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330950"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse15">Colossians&nbsp;1:15-20</a></span> So through the power of these works He is the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For assuredly the Creator of things invisible is not compelled by any necessity inherent in His nature to be the visible image of the invisible God. And lest He should be regarded as the likeness of the form and not of the nature, He is styled the likeness of the invisible God in order that we may understand by His exercise of the powers (not the invisible attributes) of the Divine nature, that that nature is in Him.</p>

<p>50. He is accordingly the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of every creature because in Him all things were created. And lest any one should dare to refer to any other than Him the creation of all things in Himself, he says, <em>All things have been created through Him and in Him, and He is before all, and for Him all things consist</em>. All things then consist for Him Who is before all things, and in Whom are all things. Now this indeed describes the origin of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things. But concerning the dispensation by which He assumed our body, he adds, <em>And He is the head of the body, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: Who is the beginning, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> from the dead: that in all things He might have the pre-eminence. For it was the good pleasure of the Father that in Him should all the fullness dwell, and that through Him all things should be reconciled to Him</em>. The Apostle has assigned to the spiritual <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> their material effects. For He Who is the image of the invisible God is Himself the head of His body, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and He Who is the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of every creature is at the same time the beginning, the first born from the dead: that in all things He might have the pre-eminence, being for us the Body, while He is also the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He, Who is the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, is at the same time the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; so that as to Him things spiritual, being created in the First-born, owe it that they abide, even so all things <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> also owe it to Him that in the First-born from the dead they are born again into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. For He is Himself the beginning, Who as Son is therefore the image, and because the image, is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Further He is the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of every created thing, possessing in Himself the origin of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>: and again He is the head of His body, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> from the dead, so that in all things He has the pre-eminence. And because all things consist for Him, in Him the fullness of the Godhead is pleased to dwell, for in Him all things are reconciled through Him to Him, through Whom all things were created in Himself.</p>

<p>51. Do you now perceive what it is to be the image of God? It means that all things are created in Him through Him. Whereas all things are created in Him, understand that He, Whose image He is, also creates all things in Him. And since all things which are created in Him are also created through Him, recognize that in Him Who is the image there is present the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Him, Whose image He is. For through Himself He creates the things which are created in Him, just as through Himself all things are reconciled in Him. Inasmuch as they are reconciled in Him, recognise in Him the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Father's unity, reconciling all things to Himself in Him. Inasmuch as all things are reconciled through Him, perceive Him reconciling to the Father in Himself all things which He reconciled through Himself. For the same Apostle says, <em>But all things are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who reconciled us to Himself through Christ, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation: to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330951"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:18-19</a></span> Compare with this the whole <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For He Who is seen when Jesus is seen, Who works in His works, and speaks in His words, also reconciles in His reconciliation. And for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in Him and through Him there is reconciliation, because the Father abiding in Him through a like nature restored the world to Himself by reconciliation through and in Him.</p>

<p>52. Thus God out of regard for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness has not set forth the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in bare and uncertain statements. For although the authority of our Lord's mere words of itself compelled their acceptance, He nevertheless has informed our reason by a revelation which explains their meaning, that we might learn to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His words, <em>I and the Father are one</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330952"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span>, by means of that which was itself the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the unity in question. For in saying that the Father speaks in His words, and works through His working, and judges through His judgment, and is seen in His manifestation, and reconciles through His reconciliation, and abides in Him, while He in turn abides in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>&mdash;what more fitting words, I ask, could He have employed in His teaching to suit the faculties of our reason, that we might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Their unity, than those by which, through the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the birth and the unity of the nature, it is declared that whatever the Son did and said, the Father said and did in the Son? This says nothing of a nature foreign to Himself, or added by creation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or born into Godhead by a partition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but it betokens the divinity of One Who by a perfect birth is begotten perfect <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who has so confident an assurance of His nature that He says, <em>I in the Father and the Father in Me</em> , and again, <em>All things whatsoever the Father has are Mine</em>.  For nought of the Godhead is lacking in Him, in Whose working and speaking and manifestation God works and speaks and is beheld. They are not two Gods, Who in their working and words and manifestation put on a semblance of unity. Neither is He a solitary God. Who in the works and words and sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Himself worked and spoke and was seen as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The Church understands this. The Synagogue does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that being One of One, Whole of Whole, God and Son, He has neither by His birth deprived the Father of His completeness, nor failed to possess the same completeness in Himself by right of His birth. And whosoever is caught in this folly of unbelief is a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> either of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>.</p>

<p>53. Now that you may understand the saying of the Lord, when He said, <em>All things whatsoever the Father has are Mine</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330955"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;16:15</a></span>, learn the teaching and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Apostle who said, <em>Take heed lest any lead you astray through <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain deceit, after the tradition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, after the elements of the world and not after Christ; for in Him dwells the fullness of Godhead bodily</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330956"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse8">Colossians&nbsp;2:8-9</a></span> That man is of the world and savours of the teaching of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and is the victim of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Christ to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who does not recognise in Him the fullness of Godhead. The mind of man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> only that which it understands, and the world's powers of belief are limited, since it judges according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the material elements that that alone is possible which it can see or do. For the elements of the world have come into being out of nothing, but Christ's continuity of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> did not begin in the non-existent, nor did He ever begin to exist, but He took from the beginning a beginning which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. The elements of the world are either without life, or have issued out of this stage into life, but Christ is life, born to be living God from the living God. The elements of the world have been established by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but they are not God: Christ as God of God is Himself wholly all that God is. The elements of the world, since they are within it, cannot possibly rise out of their condition and cease to be within it, but Christ, while having God within Himself through the Mystery, is Himself in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The elements of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, generating from themselves creatures with a life like their own, do indeed through the exercise of their bodily functions bestow upon them from their own bodies the beginnings of life, but they are not themselves present as living beings in their offspring, whereas in Christ all the fullness of the Godhead is present in bodily shape.</p>

<p>54. Now I ask, whose Godhead is it whereof the fullness dwells in Him? If it be not that of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, what other God do you, misleading preacher of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thrust upon me as Him Whose Godhead dwells fully in Christ? But if it be that of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, inform me how this fullness dwells in Him in bodily fashion. If you hold that the Father abides in the Son in bodily fashion, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, while dwelling in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, will not exist in Himself. If on the other hand, and this is more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the Godhead abiding in Him in bodily shape displays within Him the verity of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as God is in Him, abiding neither through condescension nor through will but by birth, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and wholly in bodily fullness according as He is; and inasmuch as, in the whole compass of His being, He was born by His divine birth to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and within the Godhead there is no difference or dissimilarity, except that in Christ He dwells in bodily form, and yet whatever dwells in Him bodily is according to the fullness of Godhead; why follow after the doctrines of men? Why cleave to the teaching of empty falsehoods? Why talk of 'agreement' or 'harmony of will?' or 'a creature?' The fullness of Godhead dwells in Christ bodily.</p>

<p>55. The Apostle has herein held fast to the canon of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by teaching that the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Christ bodily; and this, in order that the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might not degenerate into an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> profession of a oneness of Persons or sinful frenzy break forth into the belief of two different natures. For the fullness of Godhead which dwells in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in bodily fashion is neither solitary nor separable; for the fullness in bodily form does not admit any partition from the other bodily fullness, and the indwelling Godhead cannot be regarded as also the dwelling-place of the Godhead. And Christ is so constituted that the fullness of Godhead dwells in Him in bodily fashion, and that this fullness must be held one in nature with Christ. Lay hands on every chance that offers for your quibbles, sharpen the points of your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> wit. Name, at least, the imaginary being whose fullness of Godhead it is which dwells in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in bodily fashion. For He is Christ, and there is dwelling in Him in bodily fashion the fullness of Godhead.</p>

<p>56. And if you would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what it is to 'dwell in bodily fashion,' understand what it is to speak in one that speaks, to be seen in one who is seen, to work in one who works, to be God in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whole of whole, one of one; and thus learn what is meant by the fullness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in bodily shape. Remember, too, that the Apostle does not keep silence on the question, whose Godhead it is, which dwells fully in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in bodily fashion, for he says, <em>For the invisible things of Him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even His everlasting power and divinity</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330957"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;1:20</a></span> So it is His Godhead that dwells in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in bodily fashion, not partially but wholly, not parcelwise but in fullness; and so dwelling that the Two are one, and so one, that the One Who is God does not differ from the Other Who is God: Both so equally divine, as a perfect birth engendered perfect God. And the birth exists thus in its perfection, because the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily in God born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>
