<h1>On the Trinity (Book VII)</h1>

<div class="stiki"><p>Book VII. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> are adepts at concealing their meaning; at the use of Scripture terms in unscriptural senses (&sect; 1). They have already been refuted by the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and coeternal Son; and Hilary now advances to the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> inseparable from His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Sonship (&sect; 2). But the danger is great lest, in attacking one <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, he should use language which would sanction others (&sect; 3). Yet the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is one, while <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> are manifold. Each of them can be trusted to demolish the others, while none can establish its own case. He illustrates this by the mutually destructive arguments of Sabellius, <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Photinus (&sect;&sect; 5-7). Christ is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be God by the name <em>God </em>which is given Him in Scripture: <em>The Word was God </em>(&sect;&sect; 8, 9). The name is His in the strict sense, and not any derivative meaning (&sect;&sect; 10, 11). Yet Father and Son are not two, but one God (&sect; 13). Being the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, He has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore is God (&sect;&sect; 14-17), and yet not one Person with the Father (&sect; 18). Again, His power, manifested in His works, proves His Godhead (&sect; 19), as does the fact that all judgment has been given Him by the Father (&sect; 20). Christ's own words display the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (&sect; 21). The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> are blind to the plain sense of Scripture, and are more <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> than the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; Christ's reply to the latter meets the objections of the former (&sect;&sect; 22-24). He asserts His unity with the Father (&sect; 25), and makes His works the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> (&sect; 26). The Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father (&sect; 27): this is illustrated by the transmission of physical properties from parent to child and from flame to flame (&sect;&sect; 28-30). In fact, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> is the only rational explanation of the words of Scripture (&sect;&sect; 31, 32). Again (&sect;&sect; 33-38), the way to the Father is through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Son is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father. This would be impossible, were not the Son God in the same sense in which the Father is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus the contrary doctrines of Sabellius and of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> are confuted; there is neither one Person, nor yet two Gods (&sect;&sect; 39, 40). Christ calls upon us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and belief is not only possible but reasonable (&sect; 41).</p></div>

<p>1. This is the seventh book of our treatise against the wild extravagance of modern <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. In order of place it must follow its predecessors; in order of importance, as an exposition of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, it precedes and excels them all. I am well aware how hard and steep is the path of evangelical instruction up which we are mounting. The fears inspired by consciousness of my own incapacity are plucking me back, but the warmth of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> urges me on; the assaults of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> heat my blood, and the dangers of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> excite my compassion. I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to speak, and yet I cannot be silent. A double dread subdues my spirit; it may be that speech, it may be that silence, will render me guilty of a desertion of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For this cunning <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> has hedged itself round with marvellous devices of perverted ingenuity. First there is the semblance of devotion; then the language carefully chosen to lull the suspicions of a candid listener; and again, the accommodation of their views to secular <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; and finally, their withdrawing of attention from manifest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by a pretended explanation of Divine methods. Their loud profession of the unity of God is a fraudulent imitation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; their assertion that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> a play upon words for the delusion of their hearers; their saying that He did not exist before He was born a bid for the support of the world's <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; their confession of God as incorporeal and immutable leads, by a display of fallacious logic, up to a denial of the birth of God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They turn our arguments against ourselves; the Church's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is made the engine of its own destruction. They have contrived to involve us in the perplexing position of an equal danger, whether we reason with them or whether we refrain. For they use the fact that we allow certain of their assumptions to pass unchallenged as an argument on behalf of those which we do contradict.</p>

<p>2. We call to mind that in the preceding books the reader has been urged to study the whole of that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> manifesto , and mark how it is animated throughout by the one aim of propagating the belief that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is neither <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Its authors argue that He is permitted to use the names of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of Son by virtue of a certain adoption, though neither Godhead nor Sonship be His by nature. They use the fact, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in itself, that God is immutable and incorporeal, as an argument against the birth of the Son from Him. They value the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is One, only as a weapon against our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Godhead of Christ; pleading that an incorporeal nature cannot be rationally conceived as generating another, and that our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in One God is inconsistent with the confession of God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But our earlier books have already refuted and foiled this argument of theirs by an appeal to the Law and the Prophets. Our defence has followed, step by step, the course of their attack. We have set forth God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and at the same time confessed One <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; showing that this presentation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> neither falls short of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by ascribing singleness of Person to the One <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor adds to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by asserting the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a second Deity. For we confess neither an isolated <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor yet two Gods. Thus, neither denying that God is One nor maintaining that He is alone, we hold the straight road of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Each Divine Person is in the Unity, yet no Person is the One God. Next, our purpose being to demonstrate the irrefragable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> by the evidence of the Evangelists and Apostles, our first duty has been to make our readers acquainted with the nature, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> subsisting and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born, of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; to demonstrate that He has no origin external to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was not created out of nothing, but is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, born from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which the evidence adduced in the last book has placed beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. The assertion that He bears the name of Son by virtue of adoption has been put to silence, and He stands forth as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth. Our present task is to prove from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> that, because He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son, He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God also. For unless He be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son He cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God unless He be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son.</p>

<p>3. Nothing is more harassing to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> than the sense of impending danger. If calamities unknown or unanticipated befall us, we may need pity, yet we have been free from care; no load of anxiety has oppressed us. But he whose mind is full of possibilities of trouble suffers already a torment in his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. I who now am venturing out to sea, am a mariner not unused to shipwreck, a traveller who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> by experience <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brigands lurk in the forests, an explorer of African deserts aware of the danger from scorpions and asps and basilisks.  I enjoy no instant of relief from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of present danger. Every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> is on the watch, noting every word as it drops from my mouth. The whole progress of my argument is infested with ambuscades and pitfalls and snares. It is not of the road, of its hardness or steepness, that I complain; I am following in the footsteps of the Apostles, not choosing my own path. My trouble is the constant peril, the constant dread, of wandering into some ambush, of stumbling into some pit, of being entangled in some net. My purpose is to proclaim the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the sense of the Law and Prophets and Apostles. Sabellius is at hand, eager with cruel kindness to welcome me, on the strength of this unity, and swallow me up in his own destruction. If I withstand him, and deny that, in the Sabellian sense, God is One a fresh <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is ready to receive me, pointing out that I teach the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of two Gods. Again, if I undertake to tell how the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was born from Mary, Photinus, the Ebion of our day, will be prompt to twist this assertion of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> into a confirmation of his lie. I need mention no other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> save one; all the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that they are alien from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is one that has been often denounced, often rejected, yet it preys upon our vitals still. Galatia  has reared a large brood of godless assertors of the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Alexandria  has sown broadcast, over almost the whole world, her denial, which is an affirmation, of the doctrine of two Gods. Pannonia  upholds her pestilent doctrine that the only birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was from the Virgin. And the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, distracted by these rival faiths, is in danger of being led by means of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> into a rejection of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Doctrines are being forced upon her for godless ends, which, according to the use that is made of them, will either support or overthrow the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For instance, we cannot, as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, assert that God is One, if we mean by it that He is alone; for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in a lonely God denies the Godhead of the Son. If, on the other hand, we assert, as we <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> can, that the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we are in danger, so they fondly <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, of deserting the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that God is One. We are in peril on either hand; we may deny the unity or we may maintain the isolation. But it is a danger which has no terrors for the <em>foolish things of the world</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330850"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:27</a></span> Our adversaries are blind to the fact that His assertion that He is not alone is consistent with unity; that though He is One He is not solitary.</p>

<p>4. But I trust that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, by the light of her doctrine, will so enlighten the world's vain wisdom, that, even though it accept not the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it will recognise that in our conflict with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> we, and not they, are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> representatives of that <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. For great is the force of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; not only is it its own sufficient <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, but the more it is assailed the more evident it becomes; the daily shocks which it receives only increase its inherent stability. It is the peculiar property of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that when she is buffeted she is triumphant, when she is assaulted with argument she proves herself in the right, when she is deserted by her supporters she holds the field. It is her wish that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should remain at her side and in her bosom; if it lay with her, none would become unworthy to abide under the shelter of that august mother, none would be cast out or suffered to depart from her calm retreat. But when <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> desert her or she expels them, the loss she endures, in that she cannot save them, is compensated by an increased assurance that she alone can offer bliss. This is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which the passionate <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of rival <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> brings into the clearest prominence. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, ordained by the Lord and established by His Apostles, is one for all; but the frantic folly of discordant <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> has severed them from her. And it is obvious that these dissensions concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> result from a distorted <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which twists the words of Scripture into conformity with its opinion, instead of adjusting that opinion to the words of Scripture. And thus, amid the clash of mutually destructive <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> stands revealed not only by her own teaching, but by that of her rivals. They are ranged, all of them, against her; and the very fact that she stands single and alone is her sufficient answer to their godless delusions. The hosts of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> assemble themselves against her; each of them can defeat all the others, but not one can win a victory for itself. The only victory is the triumph which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> celebrates over them all. Each <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> wields against its adversary some weapon already shattered, in another instance, by the Church's condemnation. There is no point of union between them, and the outcome of their internecine struggles is the confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>5. Sabellius sweeps away the birth of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and then preaches the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but he does not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the mighty Nature, which acted in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> Christ, was God. He shuts his eyes to the revealed <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Sonship; the works done seem to him so marvellous that he cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He who performed them could undergo a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> generation. When he hears the words, <em>He that has seen Me has seen the Father also</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330851"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;14:9</a></span>, he jumps to the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> conclusion of an inseparable and indistinguishable identity of nature in Father and Son, because he fails to see that the revelation of the birth is the mode in which Their unity of nature is manifested to us. For the fact that the Father is seen in the Son is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the Son's Divinity, not a disproof of His birth. Thus our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Each of Them is conditioned by our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Other, for there is no difference of nature between them and, since in this respect they are One, a reverent study of the character of Either will give us a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> insight into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Both. For, indeed, it is certain that He, Who was in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must in His self-revelation present Himself to us in the exact aspect of the form of God. <span class="stiki" id="note330852"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;2:6</a></span> Again, this perverse and insane delusion derives a further encouragement from the words, <em>I and the Father are One</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330853"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span> From the fact of unity in the same nature they have impiously deduced a confusion of Persons; their interpretation, that the words signify a single Power, contradicts the tenour of the passage. For <em>I and the Father are One </em>does not indicate a solitary God. The use of the conjunction <em>and </em>shows clearly that more than one Person is signified; and <em>are </em>requires a plurality of subject. Moreover, the <em>One </em>is not incompatible with a birth. Its sense is, that the Two Persons have the one nature in common. The <em>One </em>is inconsistent with difference; the <em>are </em>with identity.</p>

<p>6. Set our modern <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in array against the delusion, equally wild, of Sabellius; let them make the best of their case. The new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> will advance the passage. <em>The Father is greater than I</em>.  Neglecting the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Divine birth, and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of God's emptying Himself and taking flesh, they will argue the inferiority of His nature from His assertion that the Father is the greater. They will plead against Sabellius that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a Son, in so far as One can be a Son who is inferior to the Father and needs to ask for restoration to His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and fears to die and indeed did die. In reply Sabellius will adduce His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> in evidence of His Divine nature; and while our novel <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, to escape the admission of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Sonship, will heartily agree with him that God is One, Sabellius will emphatically assert the same article of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in the sense that no Son exists. The one side lays stress upon the action of the Son; the other urges that in that action God is manifest. The one will demonstrate the unity, the other disprove the identity. Sabellius will defend his position thus:&mdash; <q>The works that were done could have been done by no other nature than the Divine. Sins were remitted, the sick were healed, the lame ran, the blind saw, the dead lived. God alone has power for this. The words <em>I and the Father are One</em> could only have been spoken from self-<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; no nature, outside the Father's, could have uttered them. Why then suggest a second substance, and urge me to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a second God? These works are peculiar to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the One God wrought them.</q> His adversaries, animated by a <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, equally venomous, for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, will argue that the Son is unlike in nature to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father:&mdash; <q>You are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. You must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a Son through Whom the worlds were made, through Whom man was fashioned, Who gave the Law through Angels, Who was born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, Who was sent by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, was crucified, dead and buried, Who rose again from the dead and is at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the Judge of quick and dead. Unto Him we must rise again, we must confess Him, we must earn our place in His kingdom.</q> Each of the two enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is fighting the Church's battle. Sabellius displays Christ as God by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the Divine nature manifested in His works; Sabellius' antagonists confess Christ, on the evidence of the revealed <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<p>7. Again, how <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> a victory for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is that in which Ebion&mdash; in other words, Photinus&mdash; both wins the day and loses it! He castigates Sabellius for denying that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is Man, and in his turn has to submit to the reproaches of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> fanatics for failing to see that this Man is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Against Sabellius he calls the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> to his aid, with their evidence concerning the Son of Mary; <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> deprives him of this ally by proving that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> make Christ something more than the Son of Mary. Sabellius denies that there is a <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; against him Photinus elevates man to the place of Son. Photinus will hear nothing of a Son born before the worlds; against him, <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> denies that the only birth of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> birth. Let them defeat one another to their hearts' content, for every victory which each of them wins is balanced by a defeat. Our present adversaries are ranted in the matter of the Divine nature of the Son; Sabellius in the matter of the Son's revealed <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; Photinus is convicted of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, or else of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, in his denial of the Son's birth before the worlds. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is based upon the teaching of Evangelists and Apostles, holds fast, against Sabellius, her assertion that the Son exists; against <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, that He is God by nature; against Photinus, that He created the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. And she is the more convinced of her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in that they cannot combine to contradict it. For Sabellius points to the works of Christ in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the Divinity of Him Who wrought them, though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not that the Son was their Author. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> grant Him the name of Son, though they confess not that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of God dwelt in Him. Photinus maintains His manhood, though in maintaining it he forgets that Christ was born as God before the worlds. Thus, in their several assertions and denials, there are points in which each <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is in the right in defence or attack; and the result of their conflicts is that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of our confession is brought into clearer light.</p>

<p>8. I felt that I must spare a little space to point this out. It has been from no <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for amplification, but that it might serve as a warning. First, I wished to expose the vague and confused character of this crowd of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, whose mutual feuds turn, as we have seen, to our advantage. Secondly, in my warfare against the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> doctrines of modern <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; that is, in my task of proclaiming that both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and God the Son are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;in other words, that Father and Son are One in name, One in nature, One in the kind of Divinity which they possess&mdash;I wished to shield myself from any charge which might be brought against me, either as an advocate of two Gods or of one lonely and isolated Deity. For in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as I have set them forth, no confusion of Persons can be detected; nor in my exposition of Their common nature can any difference between the Godhead of the One and of the Other be discerned. In the preceding book I have sufficiently refuted, by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, those who deny the subsistence of God the Son by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; my present duty is to show that He, Who in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His nature is <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, is also in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His nature God. But this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> must not degenerate into the fatal profession of a solitary <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or of a second God. It shall manifest God as One yet not alone; but in its care to avoid the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of making Him lonely it shall not fall into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of denying His unity.</p>

<p>9. Thus we have all these different assurances of the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>:&mdash; His name, His birth, His nature, His power, His own assertion. As to the name, I conceive that no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is possible. It is written, <em>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330855"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> What reason can there be for suspecting that He is not what His name indicates? And does not this name clearly describe His nature? If a statement be contradicted, it must be for some reason. What reason, I demand, is there in this instance for denying that He is God? The name is given Him, plainly and distinctly, and unqualified by any incongruous addition which might raise a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. The Word, we read, which was made flesh, was none other than God. Here is no loophole for any such conjecture as that He has received this name as a favour or taken it upon Himself, so possessing a titular Godhead which is not His by nature.</p>

<p>10. Consider the other recorded instances in which this name was given by favour or assumed. To <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> it was said, <em>I have made you a god to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330856"><a href="../bible/exo007.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;7:1</a></span> Does not this addition, <em>to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a></em>, account for the title? Did God impart to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the Divine nature? Did He not rather make <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> a god in the sight of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, who was to be smitten with terror when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> serpent swallowed the magic serpents and returned into a rod, when he drove back the venomous flies which he had called forth, when he stayed the hail by the same power wherewith he had summoned it, and made the locusts depart by the same might which had brought them; when in the wonders that he wrought the magicians saw the finger of God? That was the sense in which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was appointed to be god to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>; he was feared and entreated, he chastised and healed. It is one thing to be appointed a god; it is another thing to be God. He was made a god to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>; he had not that nature and that name wherein God consists. I call to mind another instance of the name being given as a title; that where it is written, <em>I have said, You are gods</em>.  But this is obviously the granting of a favour. <em>I have said </em>proves that it is no definition, but only a description by One Who chooses to speak thus. A definition gives us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the object defined; a description depends on the arbitrary will of the speaker. When a speaker is manifestly conferring a title, that title has its origin only in the speaker's words, not in the thing itself. The title is not the name which expresses its nature and kind.</p>

<p>11. But in this case the <em>Word </em>in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Godhead exists in the Word, and that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is expressed in the Word's name. For the name Word is inherent in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> as a consequence of His <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> birth, as are also the names <em>Wisdom </em>and <em>Power</em>. These, together with the substance which is His by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth, were called into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> ; yet, since they are the elements of God's nature, they are still immanent in Him in undiminished extent, although they were born from Him to be His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. For, as we have said so often, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which we preach is that of a Son Who owes His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> not to division but to birth. He is not a segment cut off, and so incomplete, but an Offspring born, and therefore perfect; for birth involves no diminution of the Begetter, and has the possibility of perfection for the Begotten. And therefore the titles of those substantive properties  are applied to God the Only-begotten, for when He came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by birth it was they which constituted His perfection; and this although they did not thereby desert the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in Whom, by the immutability of His nature, they are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> present. For instance, the Word is God the Only-begotten, and yet the Unbegotten Father is never without His Word. Not that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Son is that of a sound which is uttered. He is God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, subsisting through a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth; God's own Son, born from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, indistinguishable from Him in nature, and therefore inseparable. This is the lesson which His title of the Word is meant to teach us. And in the same way Christ is the Wisdom and the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not that He is, as He is often regarded , the inward activity of the Father's might or thought, but that His nature, possessing through birth a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> substantial <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, is indicated by these names of inward forces. For an object, which has by birth an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of its own, cannot be regarded as a property; a property is necessarily inherent in some being and can have no independent <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But it was to save us from concluding that the Son is alien from the Divine nature of His Father that He, the Only-begotten from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> God His Father, born as God into a substantial <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of His own, has had Himself revealed to us under these names of properties, of which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, out of Whom He came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, has suffered no diminution. Thus He, being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is nothing else than God. For when I hear the words, <em>And the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></em>, they do not merely tell me that the Son was called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; they reveal to my understanding that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In those previous instances, where <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was called god and others were styled gods, there was the mere addition of a name by way of title. Here a solid essential <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is stated; <em>The Word was God</em>. That <em>was</em> indicates no accidental title, but an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reality, a permanent element of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, an inherent character of His nature.</p>

<p>12. And now let us see whether the confession of Thomas the Apostle, when he cried, <em>My Lord and My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, </em>corresponds with this assertion of the Evangelist. We see that he speaks of Him, Whom he confesses to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <em>My God</em>. Now Thomas was undoubtedly familiar with those words of the Lord, <em>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord your God is One</em>. How then could the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of an Apostle become so oblivious of that primary command as to confess Christ as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when life is conditional upon the confession of the Divine unity? It was because, in the light of the Resurrection, the whole <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had become visible to the Apostle. He had often heard such words as, <em>I and the Father are One</em>, and, <em>All things that the Father has are Mine</em>, and, <em>I in the Father and the Father in Me</em> ; and now he can confess that the name of God expresses the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, without peril to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Without breach of loyalty to the One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, his devotion could now regard the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that everything contained in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Son was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> of the same nature with the Father. No longer need he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that such a confession as his was the proclamation of a second <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a treason against the unity of the Divine nature; for it was not a second God Whom that perfect birth of the Godhead had brought into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">being</a>. Thus it was with full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that Thomas confessed his Lord and his God. It was not a title of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; it was a confession of nature. He <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that Christ was God in substance and in power. And the Lord, in turn, shows that this act of worship was the expression not of mere reverence, but of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when He says, <em>Because you have seen, you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; blessed are they which have not seen, and have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a></em>. For Thomas had seen before he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. But, you ask, What was it that Thomas <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>? That, beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, which is expressed in his words, <em>My Lord and my God</em>. No nature but that of God could have risen by its own might from death to life; and it is this fact, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which was confessed by Thomas with the confidence of an assured <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Shall we, then, dream that His name of God is not a substantial reality, when that name has been proclaimed by a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> based upon certain evidence? Surely a Son devoted to His Father, One Who did not His own will but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that sent Him, Who sought not His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> but the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him from Whom He came, would have rejected the adoration involved in such a name as destructive of that unity of God which had been the burden of His teaching. Yet, in fact, He confirms this assertion of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, made by the believing Apostle; He accepts as His own the name which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Father. And He teaches that they are blessed who, though they have not seen Him rise from the dead, yet have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, on the assurance of the Resurrection, that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>13. Thus the name which expresses His nature proves the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of our confession of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For the name, which indicates any single substance, points out also any other substance of the same kind; and, in this instance, there are not two substances but one substance, of the one kind. For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; this is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> expressed in His name. The one name does not embrace two Gods; for the one name God is the name of one indivisible nature. For since the Father is God and the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that name which is peculiar to the Divine nature is inherent in Each, therefore the Two are One. For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, though He subsists through a birth from the Divine nature, yet preserves the unity in His name; and this birth of the Son does not compel loyal <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> to acknowledge two Gods, since our confession declares that Father and Son are One, both in nature and in name. Thus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has the Divine name as the result of His birth. Now the second step in our demonstration was to be that of showing that it is by virtue of His birth that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I have still to bring forward the evidence of the Apostles that the Divine name is used of Him in an exact sense; but for the present I purpose to continue our enquiry into the language of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>.</p>

<p>14. And first I ask what new element, destructive of His Godhead, can have been imported by birth into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Son? Universal reason rejects the supposition that a being can become different in nature, by the process of birth, from the being to which its birth is due; although we recognise the possibility that from <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, different in kind, an offspring sharing the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of both, yet diverse from either, may be propagated. The fact is familiar in the case of beasts, both tame and wild. But even in this case there is no real novelty; the new qualities already exist, concealed in the two different parental natures, and are only developed by the connection. The birth of their joint offspring is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that offspring's difference from its <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. The difference is a gift from them of various diversities, which are received and combined in one frame. When this is the case as to the transmission and reception even of bodily differences, is it not a form of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> to assert that the birth of God the Only-begotten was the birth from God of a nature inferior to Himself? For the giving of birth is a function of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of the transmitter of life; and without the presence and action of that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature there can be no birth. The object of all this heat and passion is to prove that there was no birth, but a creation, of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; that the Divine nature is not His origin and that He does not possess that nature in His personal subsistence, but draws, from what was non-existent, a nature different in kind from the Divine. They are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> because He says, <em>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330862"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;3:6</a></span> For, since God is a Spirit, it is clear that in One born from Him there can be nothing alien or different from that Spirit from which He was born. Thus the birth of God constitutes Him perfect God. And hence also it is clear that we must not say that He began to exist, but only that He was born. For there is a sense in which beginning is different from birth. A thing which begins to exist either comes into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> out of nothing, or developes out of one state into another, ceasing to be what it was before; so, for instance, gold is formed out of earth, solids melt into liquids, cold changes to warmth, white to red, water breeds moving creatures, lifeless objects turn into living. In contrast to all this, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not begin, out of nothing, to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but was born as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor had He an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of another kind before the Divine. Thus He Who was born to be God had neither a beginning of His Godhead, nor yet a development up to it. His birth retained for Him that nature out of which He came into being; the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, in His distinct <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, is what God is, and is nothing else.</p>

<p>15. Again, any one who is in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning this matter may gain from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> an accurate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> nature; or rather learn that He was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, where it is written, <em>Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> sought the more to kill Him because He not only broke the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, but said also that God was His own Father, making Himself equal with God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330863"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;5:18</a></span> This passage is unlike most others in not giving us the words spoken by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but the Apostle's explanation of their motive in wishing to kill the Lord. We see that no plea of misapprehension can excuse the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of these <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a>; for we have the Apostle's evidence that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was fully revealed to them. They could speak of His birth:&mdash; <em>He said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God</em>. Was not His clearly a birth of nature from nature, when He published the equality of His nature by speaking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by name, as His own Father? Now it is manifest that equality consists in the absence of difference between those who are equal. Is it not also manifest that the result of birth must be a nature in which there is an absence of difference between Son and Father? And this is the only possible origin of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> equality; birth can only bring into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> a nature equal to its origin. But again, we can no more hold that there is equality where there is confusion, than we can where there is difference. Thus equality, as of the image <span class="stiki" id="note330864"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews&nbsp;1:3</a></span>, is incompatible with isolation and with diversity; for equality cannot dwell with difference, nor yet in solitude.</p>

<p>16. And now, although we have found the sense of Scripture, as we understand it, in harmony with the conclusions of ordinary reason, the two agreeing that equality is incompatible either with diversity or with isolation, yet we must seek a fresh support for our contention from actual words of our Lord. For only so can we check that licence of arbitrary interpretation whereby these bold traducers of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> would even venture to cavil at the Lord's solemn self-revelation. His answer to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was this:&mdash; <em>The Son can do nothing of Himself but what He sees the Father do; for what things soever He does, these also does the Son likewise. For the Father loves the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and shows Him all things that Himself does; and He will show Him greater works than these, that you may marvel. For as the Father raises up the dead and quickens them, even so the Son quickens whom He will. For the Father judges no man, but has given all judgment to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that all may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Son even as they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Father. He that honours not the Son honours not the Father which has sent Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330865"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;5:19-22</a></span> The course of our argument, as I had shaped it in my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, required that each several point of the debate should be handled singly; that, since we had been taught that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, is God in name, in birth, in nature, in power, in self-revelation, our demonstration of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should establish each successive point in that order. But His birth is a barrier to such a treatment of the question; for a consideration of it includes a consideration of His name and nature and power and self-revelation. For His birth involves all these, and they are His by the fact that He is born. And thus our argument concerning His birth has taken such a course that it is impossible for us to keep these other matters back for separate discussion in their turn.</p>

<p>17. The chief reason why the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> wished to kill the Lord was that, in calling God His Father, He had made Himself equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and therefore He put His answer, in which He reproved their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> passion, into the form of an exposition of the whole <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For just before this, when He had healed the paralytic and they had passed their judgment upon Him that He was worthy of death for breaking the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, He had said, <em>My Father works hitherto, and I work</em>.  Their jealousy had been inflamed to the utmost by the raising of Himself to the level of God which was involved in this use of the name of Father. And now He wishes to assert His birth and to reveal the powers of His nature, and so He says, <em>I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do</em>. These opening words of His reply are aimed at that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, which hurried them on even to the desire of slaying Him. It is in reference to the charge of breaking the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> that He says, <em>My Father works hitherto, and I work</em>. He wished them to understand that His practice was justified by Divine authority; and He taught them by the same words that His work must be regarded as the work of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who was working in Him all that He wrought. And again, it was to subdue the jealousy awakened by His speaking of God as His Father that He uttered those words, <em>Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do</em>. Lest this making of Himself equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as having the name and nature of God's Son, should withdraw men's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that He had been born, He says that the Son can do nothing but what He sees the Father do. Next, in confirmation of the saving harmony of truths in our confession of Father and of Son, He displays this nature which is His by birth; a nature which derives its power of action not from successive gifts of strength to do particular <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, but from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. He shows that this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not imparted by the Father's performance of any bodily work, as a pattern, that the Son may imitate what the Father has previously done; but that, by the action of the Divine nature, He had come to share the subsistence of the Divine nature, or, in other words, had been born as Son from the Father. He told them that, because the power and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God dwelt consciously within Him, it was impossible for Him to do anything which He had not seen the Father doing; that, since it is in the might of the Father that God the Only-begotten performs His works His liberty of action coincides in its range with His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the powers of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father; a nature inseparable from Himself, and lawfully owned by Him in virtue of His birth. For God sees not after a bodily fashion, but possesses, by His nature, the vision of Omnipotence.</p>

<p>18. The next words are, <em>For what things soever He</em>&mdash; the Father&mdash; <em>does, these also does the Son likewise</em>. This <em>likewise </em>is added to indicate His birth; <em>whatsoever </em>and <em>same </em>to indicate the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity of His nature. <em>Whatsoever </em>and <em>same </em>make it impossible that there should be any actions of His that are different from or outside, the actions of the Father. Thus He, Whose nature has power to do all the same things as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is included in the same nature with the Father. But when, in contrast with this, we read that all these same things are done by the Son <em>likewise</em>, the fact that the works are like those of Another is fatal to the supposition that He Who does them works in isolation. Thus the same things that the Father does are all done likewise by the Son. Here we have clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth, and at the same time a convincing attestation of the Mystery of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which, with its foundation in the Unity of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, confesses that there resides in Father and Son an indivisible Divinity. For the Son does the same things as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and does them likewise; while acting in like manner He does the same things. Two truths are combined in one proposition; that His works are done likewise proves His birth; that they are the same works proves His nature.</p>

<p>19. Thus the progressive revelation contained in our Lord's reply is at one with the progressive statement of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the Church's confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Neither of them divides the nature, and both declare the birth. For the next words of Christ are, <em>For the Father loves the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and shows Him all things that Himself does; and He will show Him greater works than these, that you may marvel. For as the Father raises up the dead, and quickens them, even so the Son quickens whom He will</em>. Can there be any other purpose in this revelation of the manner in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works, except that of inculcating the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth; the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in a subsisting Son born from the subsisting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, His Father? The only other explanation is that God the Only-begotten was so <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that He needed the instruction conveyed in this showing; but the reckless <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the suggestion makes this alternative impossible. For He, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, as He does, everything that He is taught, has no need of the teaching. And accordingly, after the words, <em>The Father loves the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and shows Him all things that Himself does</em>, we are next informed that all this showing is for our instruction in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; that the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> may have their equal share in our confession, and we be saved, by this statement that the Father shows all that He does to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, from the delusion that the Son's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is imperfect. With this object He goes on to say, <em>And He will show Him greater works than these, that you may marvel. For as the Father raises up the dead and quickens them, even so the Son quickens whom He will</em>. We see that the Son has full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the future works which the Father will show Him hereafter. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that He will be shown how, after His Father's example, He is to give life to the dead. For He says that the Father will show to the Son things at which they shall marvel; and at once proceeds to tell them what these things are; <em>For as the Father raises up the dead and quickens them, even so the Son quickens whom He will</em>. The power is equal because the nature is one and the same. The showing of the works is an aid, not to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in Him, but to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in us. It conveys to the Son no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things unknown, but it imparts to us the confidence to proclaim His birth, by assuring us that the Father has shown to Him all the works that He Himself can do. The terms used in this Divine discourse have been chosen with the utmost deliberation, lest any vagueness of language should suggest a difference of nature between the Two. Christ says that the Father's works were shown Him, instead of saying that, to enable Him to perform them, a mighty nature was given Him. Hereby He wishes to reveal to us that this showing was a substantive part of the process of His birth, since, simultaneously with that birth, there was imparted to Him by the Father's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the works which the Father willed that He should do. And again, to save us from being led, by this declaration of the showing, to suppose that the Son's nature is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and therefore different from the Father's, He makes it clear that He already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things that are to be shown Him. So far, indeed, is He from needing the authority of precedent to enable Him to act, that He is to give life to whom He will. To will implies a free nature, subsisting with power to choose in the blissful exercise of omnipotence.</p>

<p>20. And next, lest it should seem that to give life to whom He will is not within the power of One Who has been <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born, but is only the prerogative of ingenerate Omnipotence, He hastens to add, <em>For the Father judges no man, but has given all judgment to the Son</em>. The statement that all judgment is given teaches both His birth and His Sonship; for only a nature which is altogether one with the Father's could possess all things; and a Son can possess nothing, except by gift. But all judgment has been given Him for He quickens whom He will. Now we cannot suppose that judgment is taken away from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, although He does not exercise it; for the Son's whole power of judgment proceeds from the Father's, being a gift from Him. And there is no concealment of the reason why judgment has been given to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, for the words which follow are, <em>But He has given all judgment to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Son even as they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Father. He that honours not the Son honours not the Father Which has sent Him</em>. What possible excuse remains for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, or for the irreverence of denial? The reason for the gift of judgment is that the Son may receive an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> equal to that which is paid to the Father; and thus he who dishonours the Son is guilty of dishonouring the Father also. How, after this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, can we <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the nature given Him by birth is different from the Father's, when He is the Father's equal in work, in power, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, in the punishment awarded to gainsayers? Thus this whole Divine reply is nothing else than an unfolding of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His birth. And the only distinction that it is right or possible to make between Father and Son is that the Latter was born; yet born in such a sense as to be One with His Father.</p>

<p>21. Thus the Father works hitherto and the Son works. In Father and Son you have the names which express Their nature in relation to Each other. Note also that it is the Divine nature, that through which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works, that is working here. And remember, lest you fall into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of imagining that the operation of two unlike natures is here described, how it was said concerning the blind man, <em>But that the works of God may be made manifest in him, I must work the works of Him that sent Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330867"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;9:3</a></span> You see that in his case the work wrought by the Son is the Father's work; and the Son's work is God's work. The remainder of the discourse which we are considering also deals with works; but my defence is at present only concerned with assigning the whole work to Both, and pointing out that They are at one in Their method of working, since the Son is employed upon that work which the Father does hitherto. The sanction contained in this fact that, by virtue of His Divine birth, the Father is working with Him in all that He does, will save us from supposing that the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> was doing wrong in working on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. His Sonship is not affected, for there is no confusion of His Divinity with the Father's, and no negation of it; His Godhead is not affected, for His Divine nature is untouched. Their unity is not affected, for no difference is revealed to sever Them; and Their unity is not presented in such a light as to contradict Their distinct <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. First recognise the Sonship of the Son; <em>The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do. </em>Here His birth is manifest; because of it He can do nothing of Himself till He sees it being done. He cannot be unbegotten, because He can do nothing of Himself; He has no power of initiation, and therefore He must have been born. But the fact that He can see the Father's works proves that He has the comprehension which belongs to the conscious Possessor of Divinity. Next, mark that He does possess this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divine nature;&mdash; <em>For what things soever He does, these also does </em> <em>the Son likewise</em>. And now that we have seen Him endowed with the powers of that nature, note how this results in unity, how one nature dwells in the Two&mdash; <em>That all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, even as they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Father</em>. And then, lest reflection on this unity entangle you in the delusion of a solitary and self-contained <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, take to heart the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> manifested in these words, <em>He that honours not the Son honours not the Father Which has sent Him</em>. The rage and cunning of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> may do their worst; our position is impregnable. He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because He can do nothing of Himself; He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because, whatever the Father does, He does the same; They Two are One, because He is equal in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the Father and does the very same works; He is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because He is sent. So great is the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> contained in this one doctrine of the birth! It embraces His name, His nature, His power, His self-revelation; for everything conveyed to Him in His birth must be contained in that nature from which His birth is derived. Into His nature no element of any substance different in kind from that of His Author is introduced, for a nature which springs from one nature only must be entirely one with that nature which is its parent. An unity is that which, containing no discordant elements, is one in kind with itself; an unity constituted through birth cannot be solitary; for solitude can have but a single occupant, while an unity constituted through birth implies the conjunction of Two.</p>

<p>22. And furthermore, let His own Divine words bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to Himself. He says, <em>They that are of My sheep hear My voice, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, and they follow Me; and I give unto them <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them of My hand. That which My Father has given Me is greater than all, and no man shall be able to pluck them out of My Father's hand. I and the Father are one</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330868"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;10:27-30</a></span> What lethargy can blunt so utterly the edge of our understanding as to render so precise a statement for one moment obscure to us? What <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> sophistry can play such pranks with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> docility as to persuade those, who have learned from these words the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what God is that they must not recognise God in Him Whose Godhead was here revealed to them? Heresy ought either to bring forward other <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> in support of its doctrine; or else, if our existing <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> are the only documents which teach of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why do they not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the lessons taught? If they are the only source of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, why not draw <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, from them? Yet now we find that their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is held in defiance of their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and hence it is a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> rooted not in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of bold irreverence, instead of reverent humility, towards the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> confessedly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. God the Only-begotten, as we have seen, fully assured of His own nature, reveals with the utmost precision of language the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His birth. He reveals it, ineffable though it is, in such wise that we can <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and confess it; that we can understand that He was born and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He has the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and is One with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and One with Him in such a sense that God is not alone nor Son another name for Father, but that in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> He is the Son. For, firstly, He assures us of the powers of His Divine nature, saying of His sheep, <em>and no man shall pluck them out of My hand</em>. It is the utterance of conscious power, this confession of free and irresistible energy, that will allow no man to pluck His sheep from His hand. But more than this; not only has He the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but He would have us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that nature is His by birth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and hence He adds, <em>That which the Father has given Me is greater than all</em>. He makes no secret of His birth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for what He received from the Father He says is greater than all. And He Who received it, received it at His birth, not after His birth, and yet it came to Him from Another, for He received it.  But He, Who received this gift from Another, forbids us to suppose that He Himself is different in kind from That Other, and does not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> subsist with the same nature as that of Him Who gave the gift, by saying, <em>No man shall be able to pluck them out of My Father's hand</em>. None can pluck them out of His hand, for He has received from His Father that which is greater than all things. What, then, means this contradictory assertion that none can pluck them from His Father's hand? It is the Son's hand which received them from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the Father's hand which gave them to the Son: in what sense is it said that what cannot be plucked from the Son's hand cannot be plucked from the Father's hand? Hear, if you wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>:&mdash; <em>I and the Father are one</em>. The Son's hand is the Father's hand. For the Divine nature does not deteriorate or cease to be the same in passing through birth: nor yet is this sameness a bar to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the birth, for in that birth no alien element was admitted into His nature. And here He speaks of the Son's hand, which is the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that by a bodily similitude you may learn the power of the one Divine nature which is in Both; for the nature and the power of the Father is in the Son. And lastly, that in this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the birth you may discern the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and indistinguishable unity of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the words were spoken, <em>I and the Father are One</em>. They were spoken that in this unity we might see neither difference nor solitude; for They are Two, and yet no second nature came into being through that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth and generation.</p>

<p>23. There still remains, if I read them aright, the same desire in these maddened <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, though their opportunity for fulfilling it is lost. Their bitter hearts still cherish a longing for mischief which they can no longer hope to satisfy. The Lord is on His throne in heaven, and the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> cannot drag Him, as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> did, to the Cross. But the spirit of unbelief is the same, though now it takes the form of rejecting His Godhead. They bid defiance to His words, though they cannot deny that He spoke them. They vent their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> in <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; instead of stones they shower abuse. If they could they would bring Him down from His throne to a second crucifixion. When the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were moved to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> by the novelty of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching we read, <em>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore took up stones to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> Him. He answered them, Many good works have I showed you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone Me? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answered Him, For a good work we stone You not, but for <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; and because Thou, being a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, makest Yourself God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330870"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;10:31-33</a></span> I bid you, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, to recognise herein your own <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, your own words. Be sure that you are their partner, for you have made their unbelief your pattern. It was at the words, <em>I and the Father are One</em>, that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> took up stones. Their godless irritation at the revelation of that saving <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> hurried them on even to an attempt to slay. There is no one whom you can stone; but is your guilt in denying Him less than theirs? The will is the same, though it is frustrated by His throne in heaven. Nay, it is you that are more impious than the Jew. He lifted his stone against the Body, you lift yours against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; he as he thought, against man, you against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; he against a sojourner on earth, you against Him that sits upon the throne of majesty; he against One Whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, you against Him Whom you confess; he against the mortal Christ, you against the Judge of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. The Jew says, <em>Being Man; </em>you say, 'Being a creature.' You and he join in the cry, <em>Makest Yourself God</em>, with the same insolence of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. You deny that He is God begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; you deny that He is the Son by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth; you deny that His words, <em>I and the Father are One</em>, contain the assertion of one and the same nature in Both. You foist upon us in His stead a modern, a strange, an alien god; you make Him God of another kind from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or else not God at all, as not subsisting by a birth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>24. The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> contained in those words, <em>I and the Father are One</em>, moves you to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>. The Jew answered, <em>You, being a man makest Yourself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; </em>your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is a match for his:&mdash; 'Thou, being a creature, makest Yourself God.' You say, in effect, 'You are not a Son by birth, You are not God in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; You are a creature, excelling all other creatures. But You were not born to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for I refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the incorporeal God gave birth to Your nature. Thou and the Father are not One. Nay more. You are not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, You are not like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, You are not God.' The Lord had His answer for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; an answer that meets the case of your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> even better than it met theirs:&mdash; <em>Is it not written in the Law, I said, You are gods? If, therefore, He called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> cannot be broken, say ye of Me, Whom the Father has sanctified and sent into this world, that I have <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>, because I said I am the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? If I do not the works of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me not; but if I do, and you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the works, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and be sure that the Father is in Me, and I in Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330871"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;10:34-38</a></span> The matter of this reply was dictated by that of the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> attack upon Him. The accusation was that He, being a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, made Himself God. Their <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this allegation was His own statement, <em>I and the Father are One</em>. He therefore sets Himself to prove that the Divine nature, which is His by birth, gives Him the right to assert that He and the Father are One. He begins by exposing the absurdity, as well as the insolence, of such a charge as that of making Himself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though He was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. The Law had conferred the title upon <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men; the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from which there is no appeal, had given its sanction to the public use of the name. What <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, then, could there be in the assumption of the title of Son of God by Him Whom the Father had sanctified and sent into the world? The unalterable record of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> has confirmed the title to those to whom the Law assigned it. There is an end, therefore, of the charge that He, being a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, makes Himself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when the Law gives the name of <em>gods </em>to those who are confessedly men. And further, if other men may use this name without <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, there can obviously be no <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> in its use by the Man Whom the Father has sanctified,&mdash; and note here that throughout this argument He calls Himself Man, for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is also <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>&mdash; since He excels the rest, who yet are guilty of no irreverence in styling themselves gods. He excels them, in that He has been hallowed to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> says, who teaches us of this sanctification:&mdash; <em>Which He had promised afore by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, concerning His Son, Which was made of the seal of David according to the flesh, and was appointed to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with power, according to the spirit of sanctification</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330872"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;1:2-4</a></span> Thus the accusation of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> on His part, in making Himself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, falls to the ground. For the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> has conferred this name upon many men; and He, Who was sanctified and sent by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, did no more than proclaim Himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<p>25. There remains, I conceive, no possibility of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that the words, <em>I and the Father are One</em>, were spoken with regard to the nature which is His by birth. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had rebuked Him because by these words He, being a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, made Himself God. The course of His answer proves that, in this <em>I and the Father are One</em>, He did profess Himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, first in name, then in nature, and lastly by birth. For <em>I </em>and <em>Father </em>are the names of substantive Beings; <em>One </em>is a declaration of Their nature, namely, that it is essentially the same in Both; <em>are </em>forbids us to confound Them together; <em>are one</em>, while forbidding confusion, teaches that the unity of the Two is the result of a birth. Now all this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is drawn out from that name, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, which He being sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, bestows upon Himself; a name, His right to which is confirmed by His assertion, <em>I and the Father are One</em>. For birth cannot confer any nature upon the offspring other than that of the parent from whom that offspring is born.</p>

<p>26. Once more, God the Only-begotten has summed up for us, in words of His own, the whole revealed <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. When He had given His answer to the charge that He, being a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, made Himself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He determined to show that His words, <em>I and the Father are One</em>, are a clear and necessary conclusion; and therefore He thus pursued His argument&mdash; <em>You say that I have <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>, because I said, I am the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. If I do not the works of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me not; but if I do, and you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the works, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and be sure that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father</em>. After this, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> that still persists in its course perpetrates a wilful outrage in conscious despair; the assertion of unbelief is deliberate shamelessness. They who make it take <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in folly and are dead to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for it is not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, to contradict this saying. The Lord had said, <em>I and the Father are One; </em>and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His birth, which He revealed, was the unity in nature of Father and Son. Again, when He was accused for claiming the Divine nature, He justified His claim by advancing a reason;&mdash; <em>If I do not the works of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me not</em>. We are not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> His assertion that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, unless He does His Father's works. Hence we see that His birth has given Him no new or alien nature, for His doing of the Father's works is to be the reason why we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is the Son. What room is there here for adoption, or for leave to use the name, or for denial that He was born from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that He is God's Son is that He does the works which belong to the Father's nature? No creature is equal or like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, no nature external to His is comparable in might to Him; it is only the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, born from Himself, Whom we can without <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> liken and equal to Him. Nothing outside Himself can be compared to God without insult to His august majesty. If any being, not born from God's self, can be discovered that is like Him and equal to Him in power, then <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in admitting a partner to share His throne, forfeits His pre-eminence. No longer is God One, for a second, indistinguishable from Himself, has arisen. On the other hand, there is no insult in making His own <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son His equal. For then that which is like Him is His own; that which is compared with Him is born from Himself; the Power that can do His own works is not external to Him. Nay more, it is an actual heightening of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that He has begotten Omnipotence, and yet not severed that Omnipotent nature from Himself. The Son performs the Father's works, and on that ground demands that we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is God's Son. This is no claim of mere arrogance; for He bases it upon His works, and bids us examine them. And He bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that these works are not His own, but His Father's. He would not have our thoughts distracted by the splendour of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> from the evidence for His birth. And because the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> could not penetrate the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Body which He had taken, the Humanity born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, and recognise the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, He appeals to His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> for confirmation of His right to the name&mdash; <em>But if I do them, and you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the works</em>. First, He would not have them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, except on the evidence of God's works which He does. Next, if He does the works, yet seems unworthy, in His bodily humility, to bear the Divine name, He demands that they shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the works. Why should the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> birth hinder our recognition of His birth as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He that is Divinely born fulfils every Divine task by the agency of that Manhood which He has assumed? If we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not the Man, for the works' sake, when He tells us that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the works when they, which are beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are manifestly wrought by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> possesses, in virtue of His birth, everything that is God's; and therefore the Son's work is the Father's work because His birth has not excluded Him from that nature which is His source and wherein He abides, and because He has in Himself that nature to which He owes it that He exists <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>.</p>

<p>27. And so the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, Who does the Father's works and demands of us that, if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not Him, at least we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> His works, is bound to tell us what the point is as to which we are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the works. And He does tell us in the words which follow:&mdash; <em>But if I do, and you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the works, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and be sure that the Father is in Me, and I in Him</em>. It is the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as is contained in <em>I am the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em>, and <em>I and the Father are One</em>. This is the nature which is His by birth; this the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the saving <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that we must not divide the unity, nor separate the nature from the birth, but must confess that the living God was in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> born from the living God. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is Life, is not a Being built up of various and lifeless portions; He is Power, and not compact of feeble elements, Light, intermingled with no shades of darkness, Spirit, that can harmonise with no incongruities. All that is within Him is One; what is Spirit is Light and Power and Life, and what is Life is Light and Power and Spirit. He Who says, <em>I am, and I change not</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330873"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse6">Malachi&nbsp;3:6</a></span>, can suffer neither change in detail nor transformation in kind. For these attributes, which I have named, are not attached to different portions of Him, but meet and unite, entirely and perfectly, in the whole being of the living God. He is the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Power of the living Divine nature; and that which is born from Him, according to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which He reveals, could not be other than living. For when He said, <em>As the living Father has sent Me, and I live through the Father</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330874"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse57">John&nbsp;6:57</a></span>, He taught that it is through the living Father that He has life in Himself. And, moreover, when He said, <em>For as the Father has life in Himself, so has He given to the Son also to have life in Himself</em> , He bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that life, to the fullest extent, is His gift from the living God. Now if the living Son was born from the living Father, that birth took place without a new nature coming into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Nothing new comes into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> when the Living is begotten by the Living; for life was not sought out from the non-existent to receive birth; and Life, which receives its birth from Life, must needs, because of that unity of nature and because of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> event of that perfect and ineffable birth, live always in Him that lives and have the life of the Living in Himself.</p>

<p>28. I call to mind that, at the beginning of our treatise , I gave the warning that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> analogies correspond imperfectly to their Divine counterparts, yet that our understanding receives a real, if incomplete, enlightenment by comparing the latter with visible types. And now I appeal to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> experience in the matter of birth, whether the source of their children's being remain not within the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. For though the lifeless and ignoble matter, which sets in motion the beginnings of life, pass from one parent into the other, yet these retain their respective natural forces. They have brought into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> a nature one with their own, and therefore the begetter is bound up with the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the begotten; and the begotten, receiving birth through a force transmitted, yet not lost, by the begetter, abides in that begetter. This may suffice as a statement of what happens in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> birth. It is inadequate as a parallel to the perfect birth of God the Only-begotten; for humanity is born in weakness and from the union of two unlike natures, and maintained in life by a combination of lifeless substances. Again, humanity does not enter at once into the exercise of its appointed life, and never fully lives that life, being always encumbered with a multitude of members which decay and are insensibly discarded. In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on the other hand, the Divine life is lived in the fullest sense, for God is Life; and from Life nothing that is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> living can be born. And His birth is not by way of emanation but results from an act of power. Thus, since God's life is perfect in its intensity, and since that which is born from Him is perfect in power, God has the power of giving birth but not of suffering change. His nature is capable of increase , not of diminution, for He continues in, and shares the life of, that Son to Whom He gave in birth a nature like to, and inseparable from, His own. And that Son, the Living born from the Living, is not separated by the event of His birth from the nature that begot Him.</p>

<p>29. Another analogy which casts some light upon the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is that of fire as containing fire in itself and as abiding in fire. Fire contains the brightness of light, the heat which is its essential nature, the property of destroying by combustion the flickering inconstancy of flame. Yet all the while it is fire, and in all these manifestations there is but one nature. Its weakness is that it is dependent for its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> upon inflammable matter, and that it perishes with the matter on which it has lived. A comparison with fire gives us, in some measure, an insight into the incomparable nature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; it helps us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the properties of God that we find them, to a certain extent, present in an earthly element. I ask, then, whether in fire derived from fire there is any division or separation. When one flame is kindled from another, is the original nature cut off from the derived, so as not to abide in it? Does it not rather follow on, and dwell in the second flame by a kind of increase, as it were by birth? For no portion has been cut off from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the first flame, and yet there is light from light. Does not the first flame live on in the second, which owes its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, though not by division, to the first? Does not the second still dwell in the first, from which it was not cut off; from which it went forth, retaining its unity with the substance to which its nature belongs? Are not the two one, when it is physically impossible to derive light from light by division, and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> impossible to distinguish between them in nature.</p>

<p>30. These illustrations, I repeat, must only be used as aids to apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not as standards of comparison for the Divine majesty. Our method is that of using bodily instances as a clue to the invisible. Reverence and reason justify us in using such help, which we find used in God's <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to Himself, while yet we do not aspire to find a parallel to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the minds of simple <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> have been distressed by the mad <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> objection that it is wrong to accept a doctrine concerning God which needs, in order to become intelligible, the help of bodily analogies. And therefore, in accordance with that word of our Lord which we have already cited, <em>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, but that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330878"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;2:6</a></span>, we have thought it expedient, since God is Spirit, to give to these comparisons a certain place in our argument. By so doing we shall avert from God the charge that He has deceived us in using these analogies; showing, as we have done, that such illustrations from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His creatures enable us to grasp the meaning of God's self-revelation to us.</p>

<p>31. We see how the living Son of the living Father, He Who is God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, reveals the unity of the Divine nature, indissolubly One and the same, and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His birth in these words, <em>I and the Father are One</em>. Because the seeming arrogance of them engendered a prejudice against Him, He made it more clear that He had spoken in the conscious possession of Divinity by saying, <em>You say that I have <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> because I said, I am the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; </em>thus showing that the oneness of His nature with that of God was due to birth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And then, to clench their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His birth by a positive assertion, and to guard them, at the same time, from imagining that the birth involves a difference of nature, He crowns His argument with the words, <em>Believe the works, that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father</em>. Does His birth, as here revealed, display His Divinity as not His by nature, as not His own by right? Each is in the Other; the birth of the Son is from the Father only; no alien or unlike nature has been raised to Godhead and subsists as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> abiding, owes His Godhead to none other than God. Import, if you see your opportunity, two gods into the Church's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; separate Son from Father as far as you can, consistently with the birth which you admit; yet still the Father is in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Son is in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and this by no interchange of emanations but by the perfect birth of the living nature. Thus you cannot add together <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and count Them as two Gods, for They Two are One God. You cannot confuse Them together, for They Two are not One Person. And so the Apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> rejects two gods; for it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing of two Fathers or two Sons. In confessing the Father it confesses the Son; it believes in the Son in believing in the Father. For the name of Father involves that of Son, since without having a son none can be a father. Evidence of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a son is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that there has been a father, for a son cannot exist except from a father. When we confess that God is One we deny that He is single; for the Son is the complement of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and to the Father the Son's <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is due. But birth works no change in the Divine nature; both in Father and in Son that nature is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to its kind. And the right expression for us of this unity of nature is the confession that They, being Two by birth and generation, are One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not one Person.</p>

<p>32. We will leave it to him to preach two Gods, who can preach One God without confessing the unity; he shall proclaim that God is solitary, who can deny that there are two Persons, Each dwelling in the Other by the power of Their nature and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of birth given and received. And that man may assign a different nature to Each of the Two, who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that the unity of Father and of Son is a revealed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Let the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> blot out this record of the Son's self-revelation <em>I in the Father and the Father in Me; </em>then, and not till then, shall they assert that there are two Gods, or one God in loneliness. There is no hint of more natures than one in what we are told of Their possession of the one Divine nature. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that God is from God does not multiply God by two; the birth destroys the supposition of a lonely God. And again, because They are interdependent They form an unity; and that They are interdependent is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by Their being One from One. For the One, in begetting the One, conferred upon Him nothing that was not His own; and the One, in being begotten, received from the One only what belongs to one. Thus the apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in proclaiming the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, will proclaim Him as One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in confessing the Son will confess Him as One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since one and the same Divine nature exists in Both, and because, the Father being God and the Son being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the one name of God expressing the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Both, the term 'One God?' signifies the Two. God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or God in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does not mean that there are two Gods, for God abides, One from One, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> with the one Divine nature and the one Divine name; nor does God dwindle down to a single Person, for One and One can never be in solitude.</p>

<p>33. The Lord has not left in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> or obscurity the teaching conveyed in this great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>; He has not abandoned us to lose our way in dim uncertainty. Listen to Him as He reveals the full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to His Apostles;&mdash; <em>I am the Way and the Truth and the Life; no man comes unto the Father but through Me. If you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Me, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> My Father also; and from henceforth you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, and have seen Him. Philip says unto Him, Lord, show us the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and it suffices us. Jesus says unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and you have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me, Philip? He that has seen Me has seen the Father also. How do you say, Show us the Father? Do you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me, that I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father is in Me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of Myself, but the Father that dwells in Me, He does His works. Believe Me, that I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in Me; or else <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> for the very works' sake</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330879"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6-11</a></span> He Who is the Way leads us not into by-paths or trackless wastes: He Who is the Truth mocks us not with lies; He Who is the Life betrays us not into delusions which are death. He Himself has chosen these winning names to indicate the methods which He has appointed for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. As the Way, He will guide us to the Truth; the Truth will establish us in the Life. And therefore it is all-important for us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> mode, which He reveals, of attaining this life. <em>No man comes to the Father but through Me</em>. The way to the Father is through the Son. And now we must enquire whether this is to be by a course of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to His teaching, or by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His Godhead. For it is conceivable that our way to the Father may be through adherence to the Son's teaching, rather than through believing that the Godhead of the Father dwells in the Son. And therefore let us, in the next place, seek out the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of the instruction given us here. For it is not by cleaving to a preconceived opinion, but by studying the force of the words, that we shall enter into possession of this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>34. The words which follow those last cited are, <em>If you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Me, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> My Father also</em>. It is the Man, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Whom they behold. How can a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him be a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father? For the Apostles see Him wearing the aspect of that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which belongs to Him; but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not encumbered with body and flesh, and is incognisable by those who dwell in our weak and fleshly body. The answer is given by the Lord, Who asserts that under the flesh, which, in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, He had taken, His Father's nature dwells within Him. He sets the facts in their due order thus&mdash; <em>If you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Me, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> My Father also; and from henceforth you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, and have seen Him</em>. He makes a distinction between the time of sight, and the time of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. He says that from henceforth they shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him Whom they had already seen; and so shall possess, from the time of this revelation onward, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that nature, on which, in Him, they long had gazed.</p>

<p>35. But the novel sound of these words disturbed the Apostle Philip. A Man is before their eyes; this Man avows Himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and declares that when they have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him they will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father. He tells them that they have seen the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that, because they have seen Him, they shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him hereafter. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is too broad for the grasp of weak humanity; their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fails in the presence of these paradoxes. Christ says that the Father has been seen already and shall now be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; and this, although sight, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. He says that if the Son has been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, the Father has been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> also; and this though the Son has imparted <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself through the bodily senses of sight and sound, while the Father's nature, different altogether from that  of the visible Man, which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, could not be learned from their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Him Whom they have seen. He has also often borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that no man has seen the Father. And so Philip broke forth, with the loyalty and confidence of an Apostle, with the request, <em>Lord, show us the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and it suffices us</em>. He was not tampering with the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; it was but a mistake made in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. For the Lord had said that the Father had been seen already and henceforth should be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; but the Apostle had not understood that He had been seen. Accordingly he did not deny that the Father had been seen, but asked to see Him. He did not ask that the Father should be unveiled to his bodily gaze, but that he might have such an indication as should enlighten him concerning the Father Who had been seen. For he had seen the Son under the aspect of Man, but cannot understand how he could thereby have seen the Father. His adding, <em>And it suffices us</em>, to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <em>Lord, show us the Father</em>, reveals clearly that it was a mental, not a bodily vision of the Father which he desired. He did not refuse <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the Lord's words, but asked for such enlightenment to his mind as should enable him to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; for the fact that the Lord had spoken was conclusive evidence to the Apostle that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was his duty. The consideration which moved him to ask that the Father might be shown, was that the Son had said that He had been seen, and should be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> because He had been seen. There was no presumption in this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that He, Who had already been seen, should now be made manifest.</p>

<p>36. And therefore the Lord answered Philip thus&mdash; <em>Have I been so long time with you, and you have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me, Philip? </em>He rebukes the Apostle for defective <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself; for previously He had said that when He was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Father was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> also. But what is the meaning of this complaint that for so long they had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him? It means this; that if they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him, they must have recognised in Him the Godhead which belongs to His Father's nature. For His works were the peculiar works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He walked upon the waves, commanded the winds, manifestly, though none could tell how, changed the water into wine and multiplied the loaves, put devils to flight, healed diseases, restored injured limbs and repaired the defects of nature, forgave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and raised the dead to life. And all this He did while wearing flesh; and He accompanied the works with the assertion that He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Hence it is that He <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> complains that they did not recognise in His <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> birth and life the action of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, performing these <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> through the Manhood which He had assumed.</p>

<p>37. And therefore the Lord reproached them that they had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him, though He had so long been doing these works, and answered their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that He would show them the Father by saying, <em>He that has seen Me has seen the Father also</em>. He was not speaking of a bodily manifestation, of perception by the eye of flesh, but by that eye of which He had once spoken&mdash; <em>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields; for they are white to harvest</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330881"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;4:35</a></span> The season of the year, the fields white to harvest are allusions equally incompatible with an earthly and visible prospect. He was bidding them lift the eyes of their understanding to contemplate the bliss of the final harvest. And so it is with His present words, <em>He that has seen Me has seen the Father also</em>. It was not the carnal body, which He had received by birth from the Virgin, that could manifest to them the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> aspect which He wore could be no aid towards the mental vision of the incorporeal God. But God was recognised in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by such as recognised Christ as the Son on the evidence of the powers of His Divine nature; and a recognition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Son produces a recognition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. For the Son is in such a sense the Image, as to be One in kind with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and yet to indicate that the Father is His Origin. Other images, made of metals or colours or other materials by various arts, reproduce the appearance of the objects which they represent. Yet can lifeless copies be put on a level with their living originals? Painted or carved or molten effigies with the nature which they imitate? The Son is not the Image of the Father after such a fashion as this; He is the living Image of the Living. The Son that is born of the Father has a nature in no wise different from His; and, because His nature is not different, He possesses the power of that nature which is the same as His own. The fact that He is the Image proves that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is the Author of the birth of the Only-begotten, Who is Himself revealed as the Likeness and Image of the invisible God. And hence the likeness, which is joined in union with the Divine nature, is indelibly His, because the powers of that nature are inalienably His own.</p>

<p>38. Such is the meaning of this passage, <em>Have I been so long time with you, and you have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me, Philip? He that has seen Me has seen the Father also. How do you say, Show us the Father? Do you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me, that I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father is in Me? </em>It is only the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, of Whom we men are enabled, in our discourse concerning Divine things, to reason. All else that belongs to the Godhead is dark and difficult, dangerous and obscure. If any man propose to express what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in other words than those supplied by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he must inevitably either display his own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, or else leave his readers' minds in utter perplexity. The Lord, when He was asked to show the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, said, <em>He that has seen Me has seen the Father also</em>. He that would alter this is an antichrist, he that would deny it is a Jew, he that is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> a Pagan. If we find ourselves in difficulty, let us lay the fault to our own reason; if God's declaration seem involved in obscurity, let us assume that our want of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. These words state with precision that God is not solitary, and yet that there are no differences within the Divine nature. For the Father is seen in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and this could be the case neither if He were a lonely Being, nor yet if He were unlike the Son. It is through the Son that the Father is seen: and this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which the Son reveals is that They are One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not one Person. What other meaning can you attach to this saying of the Lord's, <em>He that has seen Me has seen the Father also? </em>This is no case of identity; the use of the conjunction also shows that the Father is named in addition to the Son. These words, <em>The Father also</em>, are incompatible with the notion of an isolated and single Person. No conclusion is possible but that the Father was made visible through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because They are One and are alike in nature. And, lest our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in this regard should be left in any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, the Lord proceeded, <em>How do you say, Show us the Father? </em>The Father had been seen in the Son; how then could men be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the Father? What need could there be for Him to be shown?</p>

<p>39. Again, the unity of Begetter and Begotten, manifested in sameness of nature and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> oneness of kind, proves that the Father was seen in His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature. And this is shown by the Lord's next words, <em>Believe ye not that I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in Me? </em>In no other words than these, which the Son has used, can the fact be stated that Father and Son, being alike in nature, are inseparable. The Son, Who is the Way and the Truth and the Life, is not deceiving us by some theatrical transformation of names and aspects, when He, while wearing Manhood, styles Himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. He is not <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> concealing the fact that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father ; He is not a single Person  Who hides His features under a mask, that we may <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that Two are present. He is not a solitary Being, now posing as His own Son, and again calling Himself the Father; tricking out one unchanging nature with varying names. Far removed from this is the plain honesty of the words. The Father is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Son is the Son. But these names, and the realities which they represent, contain no innovation upon the Divine nature, nothing inconsistent, nothing alien. For the Divine nature, being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to itself, persists in being itself; that which is from God is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The Divine birth imports neither diminution nor difference into the Godhead, for the Son is born into, and subsists with, a nature that is within the Divine nature and is like to it, and the Father sought out no alien element to be mingled in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His Only-begotten Son, but endowed Him with all things that are His own, and this without loss to the Giver. And thus the Son is not destitute of the Divine nature, for, being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He is from God and from none other; and He is not different from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but is indeed nothing else than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for that which is begotten from God is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Son only, and the Divine nature, in receiving birth as a Son, has not forfeited its Divinity. Thus the Father is in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the Son is in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, God is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this is not by the combination of two harmonious, though different, kinds of being, nor by the incorporating power of an ampler substance exercised upon a lesser; for the properties of matter make it impossible that things which enclose others should also be enclosed by them. It is by the birth of living nature from living nature. The substance remains the same, birth causes no deterioration in the Divine nature; God is not born from God to be ought else than God. Herein is no innovation, no estrangement, no division. It is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Father and Son are two Gods, sacrilege to assert that Father and Son are one solitary <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> to deny the unity, consisting in sameness of kind, of God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>40. Lest they, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> conforms to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, should regard this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> as something vague and obscure, the Lord has expounded it in this order&mdash; <em>Do you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me, that I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father is in Me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of Myself, but the Father that dwells in Me, He does His works</em>. In what other words than these could, or can, the possession of the Divine nature by Father and Son be declared, consistently with prominence for the Son's birth? When He says, <em>The words that I speak unto you I speak not of Myself</em>, He neither suppresses His personality, nor denies His Sonship, nor conceals the presence in Himself of His Father's Divine nature. While speaking of Himself&mdash; and that He does so speak is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the pronoun <em>I</em>&mdash; He speaks as abiding in the Divine substance; while speaking not of Himself, He bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the birth which took place in Him of God from God His Father. And He is inseparable and indistinguishable in unity of nature from the Father; for He speaks, though He speaks not of Himself. He Who speaks, though He speak not of Himself, necessarily exists, inasmuch as He speaks; and, inasmuch as He speaks not of Himself, He makes it manifest that His words are not His own. For He has added, But the <em>Father that dwells in Me, He does His works</em>. That the Father dwells in the Son proves that the Father is not isolated and alone; that the Father works through the Son proves that the Son is not an alien or a stranger. There cannot be one Person only, for He speaks not of Himself; and, conversely, They cannot be separate and divided when the One speaks through the voice of the Other. These words are the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Their unity. And again, They Two are not different One from the Other, seeing that by Their inherent nature Each is in the Other; and They are One, seeing that He, Who speaks, speaks not of Himself, and He, Who speaks not of Himself, yet does speak. And then, having taught that the Father both spoke and wrought in Him, the Son establishes this perfect unity as the rule of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash; <em>But the Father that dwells in Me, He does His works. Believe Me, that I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in Me; or else <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> for the very works' sake</em>. The Father works in the Son; but the Son also works the works of His Father.</p>

<p>41. And so, lest we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and say that the Father works in the Son through His own <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> energy, and not through the Son's possession, as His birthright, of the Divine nature, Christ says, <em>Believe Me, that I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in Me</em>. What means this, <em>Believe Me?</em> Clearly it refers back to the previous, <em>Show us the Father</em>. Their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash; that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which had demanded that the Father should be shown&mdash; is confirmed by this command to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. He was not satisfied with saying, <em>He that has seen Me has seen the Father also</em>. He goes further, and expands our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so that we can contemplate the Father in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, remembering meanwhile that the Son is in the Father. Thus He would save us from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of imagining a reciprocal emanation of the One into the Other, by teaching Their unity in the One nature through birth given and received. The Lord would have us take Him at His word, lest our hold upon the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be shaken by His condescension in assuming Humanity. If His flesh, His body, His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> seem to make His Godhead doubtful, let us at least <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, on the evidence of the works, that God is in God and God is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that They are One. For by the power of Their nature Each is in the Other. The Father loses nothing that is His because it is in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Son receives His whole Sonship from the Father. Bodily natures are not created after such a fashion that they mutually contain each other, or possess the perfect unity of one abiding nature. In their case it would be impossible that an Only-begotten  Son could exist <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, inseparable from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divine nature of His Father. Yet this is the peculiar property of God the Only-begotten, this the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> revealed in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth, this the work of the Spirit's power, that to be, and to be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is for Christ the same thing; and that this being in God is not the presence of one thing within another, as a body inside another body, but that the life and subsistence of Christ is such that He is within the subsisting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and within Him, yet having a subsistence of His own. For Each subsists in such wise as not to exist apart from the Other, since They are Two through birth given and received, and therefore only one Divine nature exists. This is the meaning of the words, <em>I and the Father are One, </em>and <em>He that has seen Me has seen the Father also</em>, and <em>I in the Father and the Father in Me</em>. They tell us that the Son Who is born is not different or inferior to the Father; that His possession, by right of birth, of the Divine nature as <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and therefore nothing else than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the supreme <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> conveyed in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> revelation of the One Godhead in Father and Son. And therefore the doctrine of the generation of the Only-begotten is guiltless of ditheism, for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, in being born into the Godhead, manifested in Himself the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God His Begetter.</p>
