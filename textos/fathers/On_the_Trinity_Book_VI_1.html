<h1>On the Trinity (Book VI)</h1>

<div class="stiki"><p>Book VI. Hilary begins by lamenting the wide extension of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>; his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> leads him to combat the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, whose insidiousness makes it the more dangerous (&sect;&sect; 1-4). He repeats in &sect;&sect; 5, 6 the same <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> creed which he had given in Book IV. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> here gain the appearance of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> by condemning <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> inconsistent with their own; and this condemnation is designed to cast upon the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the suspicion of complicity in such <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Hence he must postpone his appeal to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> till he has examined them (&sect;&sect; 7, 8). Accordingly in &sect;&sect; 9-12 he explains successively the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, Manich&aelig;us, Sabellius and Hieracas, and shows that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> rejects them all, as she does (&sect; 13) the doctrine which the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> in their creed have <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> assigned to her. Their object is to deny that the Son is coeternal with the Father and of one substance with Him (&sect;&sect; 14, 15); but this denial is clean contrary to Scripture, which it is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> to oppose (&sect;&sect; 16, 17). The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> would make a creature of Christ (&sect; 18), to Whom, in &sect;&sect; 19-21, Hilary turns with an impassioned declaration of certainty that He is very God. He then resumes the argument, and proves that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is Son by birth, not by adoption, from the words both of Father and of Son as recorded in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> (&sect;&sect; 22-25). This is confirmed (&sect;&sect; 26, 27) by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> account of His acts, which are otherwise inexplicable. The argument is clenched by a discussion of St. <!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->John 7:28, 29, and 8:42 (&sect;&sect; 28-31). The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Sonship of Christ is further <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Apostles, whose certainty increased with their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (&sect;&sect; 31-35), and especially by that of St. Peter (&sect;&sect; 36-38), of St. John (&sect;&sect; 39-43), and of St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> (&sect;&sect; 44, 45). To reject such a weight of testimony is to prefer <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> to Christ (&sect; 46). And, moreover, we have the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of those for whom He wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, of devils, of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the Apostles in peril on the sea, of the centurion by the Cross, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> (&sect;&sect; 47-52).</p></div>

<p>1. It is with a full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the dangers and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the time that I have ventured to attack this wild and godless <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which asserts that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is a creature. Multitudes of Churches, in almost every province of the Roman Empire, have already caught the plague of this deadly doctrine; <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, persistently inculcated and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> claiming to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, has become ingrained in minds which vainly <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they are loyal to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how hardly the will is moved to a thorough recantation, when <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for a mistaken <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is encouraged by the sense of numbers and confirmed by the sanction of general approval. A multitude under delusion can only be approached with difficulty and danger. When the crowd has gone astray, even though it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is in the wrong, it is ashamed to return. It claims consideration for its numbers, and has the assurance to command that its folly shall be accounted wisdom. It assumes that its size is evidence of the correctness of its opinions; and thus a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> which has found general credence is boldly asserted to have established its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>2. For my own part, it was not only the claim which my vocation has upon me, the duty of diligently preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which, as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, I owe to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that has led me on. My eagerness to write has increased with the increasing numbers endangered and enthralled by this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> theory. There was a rich prospect of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the thought of multitudes who might be saved, if they could <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and abandon the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> principles of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> folly, desert the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and surrender themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; if they would forsake the bait with which the fowler snares his prey, and soar aloft in freedom and safety, following Christ as Leader, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as instructors, <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> as guides, and accepting the perfect <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and sure <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in the confession of Father and of Son. So would they, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the words of the Lord, <em>He that honours not the Son honours not the Father which has sent Him</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330774"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;5:23</a></span>, be setting themselves to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, through <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> paid to the Son.</p>

<p>3. For of late the infection of a mortal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has gone abroad among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, whose ravages have dealt destruction and death on every hand. The sudden desolation of cities smitten, with their people in them, by earthquake to the ground, the terrible slaughter of recurring <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, the widespread mortality of an irresistible pestilence, have never wrought such fatal mischief as the progress of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> throughout the world. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unto Whom all the dead live, destroys those only who are self-destroyed. From Him Who is to be the Judge of all, Whose Majesty will temper with mercy the punishment allotted to the mistakes of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, they who deny Him can expect not even judgment, but only denial.</p>

<p>4. For this mad <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> does deny; it denies the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by means of statements borrowed from our confession, which it employs for its own godless ends. The confession of their misbelief, which I have already cited in an earlier book, begins thus:&mdash; We confess one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, alone unmade, alone <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, alone unoriginate, alone <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, alone possessing <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, alone good, alone mighty. Thus they parade the opening words of our own confession, which runs, <q>One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, alone unmade and alone un-originate,</q> that this semblance of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may serve as introduction to their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> additions. For, after a multitude of words in which an equally insincere devotion to the Son is expressed, their confession continues, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> perfect creature, but not as one of His other creatures, His Handiwork, but not as His other works.</q> And again, after an interval in which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> statements are occasionally interspersed in order to veil their impious purpose of alleging, as by sophistry they try to prove, that He came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> out of nothing, they add, <q>He, created and established before the worlds, did not exist before He was born.</q> And lastly, as though every point of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a>, that He is to be regarded neither as Son nor as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were guarded impregnably against assault, they continue:&mdash; <q>As to such phrases as <em>from Him, and from the womb, and I went out from the Father and have come</em>, if they be understood to denote that the Father extends  a part and, as it were, a development of that one substance, then the Father will be of a compound nature and divisible and changeable and corporeal, according to them; and thus, as far as their words go, the incorporeal God will be subjected to the properties of matter.</q> But, as we are now about to cover the whole ground once more, employing this time the language of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> as our weapon against this most godless <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, it has seemed best to repeat here, in the sixth book, the whole <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> document, though we have already given a full copy of it in the fourth , in order that our opponents may read it again, and compare it, point by point, with our reply, and so be forced, however reluctant and argumentative, by the clear teaching of the Evangelists and Apostles, to recognise the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> confession is as follows:&mdash; </p>

<p>5. We confess one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, alone unmade, alone <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, alone unoriginate, alone possessing <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, alone good, alone mighty, Creator, Ordainer and Disposer of all things, unchangeable and unalterable, righteous and good, of the Law and the Prophets and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that this God gave birth to the Only-begotten Son before all worlds, through Whom He made the world and all things, that He gave birth to Him not in semblance, but in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, following His own will, so that He is unchangeable and unalterable, God's perfect Creature, but not as one of His other creatures, His Handiwork, but not as His other works; not, as <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> maintained, that the Son is a development of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor, as Manich&aelig;us has declared of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, a consubstantial part of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor, as Sabellius, who makes two out of One, Son and Father at once, nor, as Hieracas, a light from a light, or a lamp with two flames, nor, as if He was previously in being and afterwards born, or created afresh, to be a Son, a notion often condemned by yourself, blessed Pope, publicly in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in the assembly of the brethren. But, as we have affirmed, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He was created by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of God before times and worlds, and has His life and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who gave Him to share His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> perfections. For, when the Father gave to Him the inheritance of all things, He did not thereby deprive Himself of attributes which are His without origination, He being the source of all things.</p>

<p>6. <q>So there are three Persons, Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for His part, is the Cause of all things, utterly unoriginate and separate from all; while the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, put forth by the Father outside time, and created and established before the worlds, did not exist before He was born, but, being born outside time before the worlds, came into being as the Only Son of the Only Father. For He is neither <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, nor co-eternal, nor co-uncreate with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor has He an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> collateral with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as some say who postulate two unborn principles. But God is before all things, as being indivisible and the beginning of all. Wherefore He is before the Son also, as indeed we have learned from you in your public preaching. Inasmuch then as He has His being from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> perfections, and His life, and is entrusted with all things, for this reason God is His Source. For He rules over Him, as being His <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He is before Him. As to such phrases as <em>from Him</em>, and <em>from the womb</em>, and <em>I went out from the Father and have come</em>, if they be understood to denote that the Father extends a part and, as it were, a development of that one Substance, then the Father will be of a compound nature and divisible and changeable and corporeal, according to them; and thus, as far as their words go, the incorporeal God will be subjected to the properties of matter. </q></p>

<p>7. Who can fail to see here the slimy windings of the serpent's track: the coiled adder, with forces concentrated for the spring, concealing the deadly weapon of its poisonous fangs within its folds? Presently we shall stretch it out and examine it, and expose the venom of this hidden head. For their plan is first to impress with certain sound statements, and then to infuse the poison of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. They speak us fair, in order to work us secret harm. Yet, amid all their specious professions, I nowhere hear God's Son entitled <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; I never hear sonship attributed to the Son. They say much about His having the name of Son, but nothing about His having the nature. That is kept out of sight, that He may seem to have no right even to the name. They make a show of unmasking other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> to conceal the fact that they are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> themselves. They strenuously assert that there is One only, One <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the end that they may strip the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and personal Divinity.</p>

<p>8. And therefore, although in the two last books I have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the teaching of the Law and Prophets that God and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, must be confessed as One <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by unity of nature and not by confusion of Persons, yet, for the complete presentation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, I must also adduce the teaching of the Evangelists and Apostles. I must show from them that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, is not of a different, an alien nature from that of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but possesses the same Divinity while having a distinct <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> through a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth. And, indeed, I cannot think that any <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> exists so witless as to fancy that, although we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God's self-revelations, yet we cannot understand them; that, if they can be understood, would not wish to understand, or would dream that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reason can devise improvements upon them. But before I begin to discuss the facts contained in these saving <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, I must first <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> with which these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> rebuke the names of other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. I shall hold up to the light this ingenious cloak for their own impiety. I shall show that this very means of concealing the deadliness of their teaching serves rather to reveal and betray it, and is a widely effectual warning of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> character of this honeyed poison.</p>

<p>9. For instance, these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> would have it that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that God was not born from God out of, and in, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To this end, when they have solemnly borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to <q>One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, alone <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>,</q> they refrain from adding <q>The Father.</q> And then, in order to escape from confessing one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead of Father and of Son by a denial of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth, they proceed, <q>Not, as <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> maintained, that the Son is a development of the Father.</q> Thus they think to cast discredit upon the birth of God from God by calling it a <q>development,</q> as though it were a form of the Valentinian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> was the author of foul and foolish imaginations; beside the chief <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he invented a whole household of deities and countless powers called <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&aelig;ons</a>, and taught that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> was a development mysteriously brought about by a secret action of will. The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Evangelists and Apostles, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing of this imaginary development, sprung from the brain of a reckless and senseless dreamer. It <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing of the <q>Depth</q> and <q>Silence</q> and the thrice ten <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&aelig;ons</a> of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>. It <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> none but One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, from Whom are all things, and One <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our Lord, through Whom are all things, Who is God born from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it occurred to them that He, in being born as God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither withdrew anything from the Divinity of His Author nor was Himself born other than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that He became God not by a new beginning of Deity but by birth from the existing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and that every birth appears, as far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> faculties can judge, to be a development, so that even that birth might be regarded as a development. And these considerations have induced them to make an attack upon the Valentinian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of development as a means of destroying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth of the Son. For the experience of common life leads worldly wisdom to suppose that there is no great difference between a birth and a development. The mind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, dull and slow to grasp the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, needs to be constantly reminded of the principle, which I have stated more than once , that analogies drawn from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> experience are not of perfect application to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of Divine power; that their only value is that this comparison with material objects imparts to the spirit such a notion of heavenly things that we may rise, as by a ladder of nature, to an apprehension of the majesty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the birth of God must not be judged by such development as takes place in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> births. When One is born from One, God born from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the circumstances of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> birth enable us to apprehend the fact; but a birth which presupposes intercourse and conception and time and travail can give us no clue to the Divine method. When we are told that God was born from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we must accept it as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that He was born, and be content with that. We shall, however, in the proper place discourse of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Divine birth, as the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and the Apostles set it forth. Our present duty has been to expose this device of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> ingenuity, this attack upon the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, concealed under the form of an attack upon a so-called development.</p>

<p>10. And then, in continuation of this same fraudulent assault upon the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, their confession proceeds thus:&mdash; <q>Nor, as Manich&aelig;us has declared of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, a consubstantial part of the Father.</q> They have already denied that He is a development, in order to escape from the admission of His birth; now they introduce, labelled with the name of Manich&aelig;us, the doctrine that the Son is a portion of the one Divine substance, and deny it, in order to subvert the belief in God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For Manich&aelig;us, the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> adversary of the Law and Prophets, the strenuous champion of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and blind worshipper of the sun, taught that That which was in the Virgin's womb was a portion of the one Divine substance, and that by the Son we must understand a certain piece of God's substance which was cut off, and made its appearance in the flesh. And so they make the most of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> that in the birth of the Son there was a division of the one substance and use it as a means of evading the doctrine of the birth of the Only-begotten, and the very name of the unity of substance. Because it is sheer <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> to speak of a birth resulting from division of the one substance they deny any birth; all forms of birth are joined in the condemnation which they pass upon the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> notion of birth by severance. And again, they abolish the unity of substance, both name and thing, because the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> hold that the unity is divisible; and deny that the Son is God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by refusing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> possessed of the Divine nature. Why does this mad <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> profess a fictitious reverence, a senseless anxiety? The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does, as these insane propounders of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> remind us, condemn Manich&aelig;us, for she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing of the Son as a portion. She <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him as whole God from whole <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as One from One, not severed but born. She is assured that the birth of God involves neither impoverishment of the Begetter nor inferiority of the Begotten. If this be the Church's own imagining, reproach her with the follies of a wisdom <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> claimed; but if she have learned it from her Lord, confess that the Begotten <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the manner of His begetting. She has learned from God the Only-begotten these truths, that Father and Son are One, and that in the Son the fullness of the Godhead dwells. And therefore she loathes this attribution to the Son of a portion of the one substance; and, because she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that He was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, she worships the Son as rightful Possessor of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity. But, for the present, let us defer our full answer to these several allegations, and hasten through the rest of their denunciations.</p>

<p>11. What follows is this:&mdash; <q>Nor, as Sabellius, who makes two out of One, Son and Father at once.</q> Sabellius holds this in wilful blindness to the revelation of the Evangelists and Apostles. But what we see here is not one <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> honestly denouncing another. It is the wish to leave no point of union between Father and Son that prompts them to reproach Sabellius with his division of an indivisible Person; a division which does not result in the birth of a second Person, but cuts the One Person into two parts, one of which enters the Virgin's womb.  But we confess a birth; we reject this confusion of two Persons in One, while yet we cleave to the Divine unity. That is, we hold that <em>God from God </em>means unity of nature; for that Being, Who, by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, became <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, can draw His substance from no other source than the Divine. And since He continues to draw His being, as He drew it at first, from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He must remain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God for ever; and hence They Two are One, for He, Who is God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has no other than the Divine nature, and no other than the Divine origin. But the reason why this <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> Sabellian confusion of two Persons into One is here condemned is that they wish to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">rob</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of her <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Two Persons in One God. But now I must examine the remaining instances of this perverted ingenuity, to save myself from the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of a censorious judge of sincere enquirers, moved rather by dislike than genuine <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. I shall show, by the terms with which they wind up their confession, what is the deadly conclusion which they have skilfully contrived shall be its inevitable issue.</p>

<p>12. Their next clause is:&mdash; <q>Nor, as Hieracas, a light from a light, or a lamp with two flames, nor as if He was previously in being, and afterwards born, or created afresh, to be a Son.</q> Hieracas ignores the birth of the Only-begotten, and, in complete unconsciousness of the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> revelations, talks of two flames from one lamp. This symmetrical pair of flames, fed by the supply of oil contained in one bowl, is His illustration of the substance of Father and Son. It is as though that substance were something separate from Either Person, like the oil in the lamp, which is distinct from the two flames, though they depend upon it for their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; or like the wick, of one material throughout and burning at both ends, which is distinct from the flames, yet provides them and connects them together. All this is a mere delusion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> folly, which has trusted to itself, and not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> asserts that God is born from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as light from light, which pours itself forth without self-diminution, giving what it has yet having what it gave. It asserts that by His birth He was what He is, for as He is so was He born; that His birth was the gift of the existing Life, a gift which did not lessen the store from which it was taken; and that They Two are One, for He, from Whom He is born, is as Himself, and He that was born has neither another source nor another nature, for He is Light from Light. It is in order to draw men's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> away from this, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine, that this lantern or lamp of Hieracas is cast in the teeth of those who confess Light from Light. Because the phrase has been used in an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> sense, and condemned both now and in earlier days, they want to persuade us that there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense in which it can be employed. Let <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> immediately abandon these groundless fears, and refrain from claiming to be the protector of the Church's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the score of a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> earned so dishonestly. For we allow nothing bodily, nothing lifeless, to have a place among the attributes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whatever is God is perfect God. In Him is nothing but power, life, light, blessedness, Spirit. That nature contains no dull, material elements; being immutable, it has no incongruities within it. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is unchangeable; and the unchangeable God begot God. Their bond of union is not, like that of two flames, two wicks of one lamp, something outside Themselves. The birth of the Only-begotten Son from God is not a prolongation in space, but a begetting; not an extension , but Light from Light. For the unity of light with light is a unity of nature, not unbroken continuation.</p>

<p>13. And again, what a wonderful example of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> ingenuity is this:&mdash; <q>Nor as if He were previously in being, and afterwards born or created afresh, to be a Son.</q> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since He was born from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was assuredly not born from nothing, nor from things non-existent. His birth was that of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> living nature. Yet, though He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He is not identical with the pre-existing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; God was born from God Who <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before Him; in, and by, His birth He partook of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His Source. If we are speaking words of our own, all this is mere irreverence; but if, as we shall prove, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself has taught us how to speak, then the necessity is laid upon us of confessing the Divine birth in the sense revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And it is this unity of nature in Father and in Son, this ineffable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the living birth, which the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is struggling to banish from belief, when it says, <q>Nor as if He were previously in being, and afterwards born, or created afresh, to be a Son.</q> Now who is senseless enough to suppose that the Father ceased to be Himself; that the same Person Who had previously <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> was afterwards born, or created afresh, to be the Son? That God disappeared, and that His disappearance was followed by an emergence in birth, when, in fact, that birth is evidence of the continuous <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of its Author? Or who is so insane as to suppose that a Son can come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> otherwise than through birth? Who so void of reason as to say that the birth of God resulted in anything else than in God being born? The abiding God was not born, but God was born from the abiding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the nature bestowed in that birth was the very nature of the Begetter. And God by His birth, which was from God into <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, received, because His was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth, not things new-created but things which were and are the permanent possession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus it is not the pre-existent God that was born; yet God was born, and began to exist, out of and with the properties of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And thus we see how <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, throughout this long prelude, has been treacherously leading up to this most <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> doctrine. Its object being to deny God the Only-begotten, it starts with what purports to be a defence of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to go on to the assertion that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is born not from God but out of nothing, and that His birth is due to the Divine counsel of creation from the non-existent.</p>

<p>14. And then again, after an interval designed to prepare us for what is coming, their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> delivers this assault&mdash;<q>While the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, put forth outside time, and created and established before the worlds, did not exist before He was born.</q> This <q>He did not exist before He was born</q> is a form of words by which the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> flatters itself that it gains two ends; support for its <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and a screen for itself if its doctrine be arraigned. A support for its <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, because, if He did not exist before He was born, He cannot be of one nature with His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Origin. He must have His beginning out of nothing, if He have no powers but such as are coeval with His birth. And a screen for its <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, for if this statement be condemned, it furnishes a ready answer. He that did exist, it will be said, could not be born; being in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> already, He could not possibly come into being by passing through the process of birth, for the very meaning of birth is the entry into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the being that is born. Fool and blasphemer! Who dreams of birth in the case of Him Who is the unborn and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>? How can we think of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>Who is</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330780"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;3:14</a></span>, being born, when being born implies the process of birth? It is the birth of God the Only-begotten from God His Father that you are striving to disprove, and it was your purpose to escape the confession of that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by means of this <q>He did not exist before He was born;</q> the confession that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from Whom the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was born, did exist <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, and that it is from His abiding nature that God the Son draws His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> through birth. If, then, the Son is born from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you must confess that His is a birth of that abiding nature; not a birth of the pre-existing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but a birth of God from God the pre-existent.</p>

<p>15. But the fiery <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is such that it cannot restrain itself from passionate outbreak. In its effort to prove, in conformity with its assertion that He did not exist before He was born, that the Son was born from the non-existent, that is, that He was not born from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father to be God the Son by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect birth, it winds up its confession by rising in rage and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to the highest pitch of possible <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>:&mdash; <q>As to such phrases as <em>from Him</em>, and <em>from the womb</em>, and <em>I went out from the Father and have come</em>, if they be understood to denote that the Father extends a part, and, as it were, a development of that one substance, then the Father will be of a compound nature and divisible and changeable and corporeal, according to them; and thus, as far as their words go, the incorporeal God will be subjected to the properties of matter.</q> The defence of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> against the falsehoods of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> would indeed be a task of toil and difficulty, if it were needful for us to follow the processes of thought as far as they have plunged into the depths of godlessness. Happily for our purpose it is shallowness of thought that has engendered their eagerness to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>. And hence, while it is easy to refute the folly, it is difficult to amend the fool, for he will neither think out right conclusions for himself, nor accept them when offered by another. Yet I trust that they who in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, not in wilful folly bred of self-conceit, are enchained by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, will welcome correction. For our demonstration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will afford convincing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is nothing else than folly.</p>

<p>16. You said in your unreason, and you are still repeating today, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that your wisdom is a defiance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>As to such phrases as <em>from Him</em>, and <em>from the womb</em>, and <em>I went out from the Father and have come</em>,</q> I ask you, Are these phrases, or are they not, words of God? They certainly are His; and, since they are spoken by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> about Himself, we are bound to accept them exactly as they were spoken. Concerning the phrases themselves, and the precise force of each, we shall speak in the proper place. For the present I will only put this question to the intelligence of every reader; When we see <em>From Himself</em>, are we to take it as equivalent to <q>From some one else,</q> or to <q>From nothing,</q> or are we to accept it as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? It is not <q>From some one else,</q> for it is <em>From Himself; </em>that is, His Godhead has no other source than God. It is not <q>From nothing,</q> for it is <em>From Himself; </em>a declaration of the nature from which His birth is. It is not <q>Himself,</q> but <em>From Himself; </em>a statement that They are related as Father and Son. And next, when the revelation <em>From the womb </em>is made, I ask whether we can possibly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is born from nothing, when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His birth is clearly indicated in terms borrowed from bodily functions. It is not because He has bodily members, that God records the generation of the Son in the words, <em>I bore You from the womb before the morning star</em>.  He uses language which assists our understanding to assure us that His Only-begotten Son was ineffably born of His own <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead. His purpose is to educate the faculties of men up to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by clothing Divine verities in words descriptive of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> circumstances. Thus, when He says, <em>From the womb</em>, He is teaching us that His Only-begotten was, in the Divine sense, born, and did not come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by means of creation out of nothing. And lastly, when the Son said, <em>I went forth from the Father and have come</em>, did He leave it doubtful whether His Divinity were, or were not, derived from the Father? He went out from the Father; that is, He had a birth, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and no other, gave Him that birth. He bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that He, from Whom He declares that He came forth, is the Author of His being. The <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> and interpretation of all this shall be given hereafter.</p>

<p>17. But meanwhile let us see what ground these men have for the confidence with which they forbid us to accept as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> the utterances of God concerning Himself; utterances, the authenticity of which they do not deny. What more grievous insult could be flung by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> folly and insolence at God's self-revelation, than a condemnation of it, shown in correction? For not even <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and criticism will satisfy them. What more grievous than this profane handling and disputing of the nature and power of God? Than the presumption of saying that, if the Son is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then God is changeable and corporeal, since He has extended or developed a part of Himself to be His Son? Whence this anxiety to prove the immutability of God? We confess the birth, we proclaim the Only-begotten, for so God has taught us. You, in order to banish the birth and the Only-begotten from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, confront us with an unchangeable <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, incapable, by His nature, of extension or development. I could bring forward instances of birth, even in natures belonging to this world, which would refute this wretched delusion that every birth must be an extension. And I could save you from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that a being can come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> only at the cost of loss to that which begets it, for there are many examples of life transmitted, without bodily intercourse, from one living creature to another. But it would be impious to deal in evidences, when God has spoken; and the utmost excess of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> to deny His authority to give us a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when our worship is a confession that He alone can give us life. For if life comes through Him alone, must not He be the Author of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is the condition of that life? And if we hold Him an untrustworthy <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> concerning Himself, how can we be sure of the life which is His gift?</p>

<p>18. For you attribute, most godless of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, the birth of the Son to an act of creative will; you say that He is not born from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that He was created and came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by the choice of the Creator. And the unity of the Godhead, as you interpret it, will not allow Him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for, since God remains One, the Son cannot retain His original nature in that state into which He has been born. He has been endowed, through creation, you say, with a substance different from the Divine, although, being in a sense the Only-begotten, He is superior to God's other creatures and works. You say that He was raised up, that He in His turn might perform the task committed to Him of raising up the created world; but that His birth did not confer upon Him the Divine nature. He was born, according to you, in the sense that He came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> out of nothing. You call Him a Son, not because He was born from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but because He was created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For you call to mind that God has deemed even <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men worthy of this title, and you consider that it is assigned to the Son in exactly the same sense in which the words, <em>I have said, You are Gods, and all of you sons of the Most High</em> , were spoken; that is, that He bears the name through the Giver's condescension, and not by right of nature. Thus, in your eyes, He is Son by adoption, God by gift of the title, Only-begotten by favour, First-born in date, in every sense a creature, in no sense God. For you hold that His generation was not a birth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the natural sense, but the beginning of the life of a created substance.</p>

<p>19. And now, Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I first must <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> You to forgive my excess of indignation, and permit me to address You; and next to grant me, dust and ashes as I am, yet bound in loyal devotion to Yourself, freedom of utterance in this debate. There was a time when I, poor wretch, was not; before my life and consciousness and personality began to exist. It is to Your mercy that I owe my life; and I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not that Thou, in Your goodness, gave me my birth for my good, for Thou, Who hast no need of me, would never have made the beginning of my life the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And then, when You had breathed into me the breath of life and endowed me with the power of thought, You instructed me in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Yourself, by means of the sacred volumes given us through Your servants <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. From them I learned Your revelation, that we must not worship You as a lonely God. For their pages taught me of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not different from You in nature but One with You in <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> unity of substance. I learned that You are God in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by no mingling or confusion but by Your very nature, since the Divinity which is Yourself dwells in Him Who is from You. But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine of the perfect birth revealed that Thou, the Indwelt, and Thou, the Indweller, are not One Person, yet that Thou dost dwell in Him Who is from You. And the voices of Evangelists and Apostles repeat the lesson, and the very words which fell from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mouth of Your Only-begotten are recorded, telling how Your Son, God the Only-begotten from You the Unbegotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was born of the Virgin as man to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; how You dwell in Him, by virtue of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> generation from Yourself, and He in You, because of the nature given in His abiding birth from You.</p>

<p>20. What is this hopeless quagmire of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> into which You have plunged me? For I have learned all this and have come to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it; this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is so ingrained into my mind that I have neither the power nor the wish to change it. Why this deception of an unhappy man, this ruin of a poor wretch in body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by deluding him with falsehoods concerning Yourself? After the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> had been divided, the splendour on the face of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, descending from the Mount, deceived me. He had gazed, in Your presence, upon all the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of heaven, and I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> his words, dictated by You, concerning Yourself. And David, the man that was found after Your own heart, has betrayed me to destruction, and Solomon, who was thought worthy of the gift of Divine Wisdom, and Isaiah, who saw the Lord of Sabaoth and prophesied, and Jeremiah <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the womb, before he was fashioned, to be the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of nations to be rooted out and planted in, and Ezekiel, the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Resurrection, and Daniel, the man beloved, who had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of times, and all the hallowed band of the Prophets; and Matthew also, chosen to proclaim the whole <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>  of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, first a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>, then an Apostle, and John, the Lord's familiar friend, and therefore worthy to reveal the deepest secrets of heaven, and blessed Simon, who after his confession of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> was set to be the foundation-stone of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and received the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and all his companions who spoke by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the chosen vessel, changed from persecutor into Apostle, who, as a living man abode under the deep sea <span class="stiki" id="note330784"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse25">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:25</a></span> and ascended into the third heaven, who was in Paradise before his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> was the perfect offering of a flawless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; all have deceived me.</p>

<p>21. These are the men who have taught me the doctrines which I hold, and so deeply am I impregnated with their teaching that no antidote can release me from their influence. Forgive me, O God Almighty, my powerlessness to change, my willingness to die in this belief. These propagators of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, for so they seem to me, are a product of these last times, too modern to avail me. It is too late for them to correct the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which I received from You. Before I had ever heard their names, I had put my trust in You, had received regeneration from You and become Yours, as still I am. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that You are <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>; I look not that Thou should reveal to me the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of that ineffable birth which is secret between Yourself and Your Only-begotten. Nothing is impossible with You, and I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not that in begetting Your Son You exerted Your full omnipotence. To <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it would be to deny that You are <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>. For my own birth teaches me that You are good, and therefore I am sure that in the birth of Your Only-begotten Thou grudged Him no good gift. I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that all that is Yours is His, and all that is His is Yours. The creation of the world is sufficient evidence to me that You are wise; and I am sure that Your Wisdom, Who is like You, must have been begotten from Yourself. And You are One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in my eyes; I will never <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that in Him, Who is God from You, there is ought that is not Yours. Judge me in Him, if it be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in me that, through Your Son, I have trusted too well in Law and Prophets and Apostles.</p>

<p>22. But this wild talk must cease; the rhetoric of exposing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> folly must give place to the drudgery of framing arguments. So, I trust, those among them who are capable of being saved will set their faces towards the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> taught by the Evangelists and Apostles, and recognise Him Who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, not by adoption but by nature. For the plan of our reply must be that of first proving that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and therefore fully endowed with that Divine nature in the possession of which His Sonship consists. For the chief aim of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which we are considering, is to deny that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Many evidences assure us that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is, and is revealed to be, God the Only-begotten, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. His Father bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to it, He Himself asserts it, the Apostles proclaim it, the faithful <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it, devils confess it, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> deny it, the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> at His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> recognised it. The name of God is given Him in the right of absolute ownership, not because He has been admitted to joint use with others of the title. Every work and word of Christ transcends the power of those who bear the title of sons; the foremost lesson that we learn from all that is most prominent in His life is that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and that He does not hold the name of Son as a title shared with a widespread company of friends.</p>

<p>23. I will not weaken the evidence for this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by intermixing words of my own. Let us hear the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was accomplished, speaking, as often, concerning His Only-begotten, in order to save us from being misled by His visible body into a failure to recognise Him as the Son. His words are:&mdash; <em>This is My beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in Whom I am well pleased</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330785"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;3:17</a></span> Is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> presented here with dim outlines? Is the proclamation made in uncertain tones? The promise of the Virgin birth brought by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the guiding star of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, the reverence paid Him in His cradle, the majesty, attested by the Baptist, of Him Who condescended to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; all these are deemed an insufficient <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. The Father Himself speaks from heaven, and His words are, <em>This is My Son</em>. What means this evidence, not of titles, but of pronouns? Titles may be appended to names at will; pronouns are a sure indication of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom they refer. And here we have, in <em>This </em>and <em>My</em>, the clearest of indications. Mark the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning and the purpose of the words. You have read,  <em>I have begotten sons, and have raised them up</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330786"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;1:2</a></span>; but you did not read there <em>My sons</em>, for He had begotten Himself those sons by division among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and from the people of His inheritance. And lest we should suppose that the name <em>Son </em>was given as an additional title to God the Only-begotten, to signify His share by adoption in some joint heritage, His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature is expressed by the pronoun which gives the indubitable sense of ownership. I will allow you to interpret the word <em>Son</em>, if you will, as signifying that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is one of a number, if you can furnish an instance where it is said of another of that number, <em>This is My Son</em>. If, on the other hand, <em>This is My Son </em>be His peculiar designation, why accuse the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when He asserts His ownership, of making an unfounded claim? When He says <em>This is My Son</em>, may we not paraphrase His meaning thus:&mdash; <q>He has given to others the title of sons, but He Himself is My own Son; I have given the name to multitudes by adoption, but this Son is My very own. Seek not for another lest you lose your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that This is He. By gesture and by voice, by <em>This</em>, and <em>My</em>, and <em>Son</em>, I declare Him to you.</q> And now what reasonable excuse remains for lack of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? This, and nothing less than this, it was that the Father's voice proclaimed. He willed that we should not be left in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Him Who came to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that He might fulfil all righteousness; that by the voice of God we might recognise as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Him Who was visible as Man, to accomplish the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>24. And again, because the life of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> was involved in the confession of this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash;for there is no other way to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life than the assurance that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, God the Only-begotten, is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>&mdash; the Apostles heard once more the voice from heaven repeating the same message, in order to strengthen this life-giving belief, in negation of which is death. When the Lord, apparelled in splendour, was standing upon the Mountain, with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias at His side, and the three Pillars of the churches who had been chosen as witnesses to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the vision and the voice, the Father spoke thus from heaven:&mdash; <em>This is My beloved Son in Whom I am well pleased; hear Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330787"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;17:5</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which they saw was not sufficient attestation of His majesty; the voice proclaims, <em>This is My Son</em>. The Apostles cannot face the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; mortal eyes grow dim in its presence. The trust of Peter and James and John fails them, and they are prostrate in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. But this solemn declaration, spoken from the Father's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, comes to their relief; He is revealed as His Father's own <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son. And over and above the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of <em>This </em>and <em>My </em>to His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Sonship, the words are uttered, <em>Hear Him</em>. It is the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the Father from heaven, in confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> borne by the Son on earth; for we are bidden to hear Him. Though this recognition by the Father of the Son removes all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, yet we are bidden also to accept the Son's self-revelation. When the Father's voice commands us to show our <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> by hearing Him, we are ordered to repose an absolute confidence in the words of the Son. Since, therefore, the Father has manifested His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in this message to us to hear the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, let us hear what it is that the Son has told us concerning Himself.</p>

<p>25. I can conceive of no man so destitute of ordinary reason as to recognise in each of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> confessions by the Son of the humiliation to which He has submitted in taking a body upon Him&mdash;as for instance His words, often repeated, <em>Father, glorify Me</em> , and <em>You shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note330789"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse64">Matthew&nbsp;26:64</a></span>, and <em>The Father is greater than I</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330790"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;14:28</a></span>, and, more strongly, <em>Now is My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> troubled exceedingly</em> , and even this, <em>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have You forsaken me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330792"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;27:46</a></span>  <em>? </em>and many more, of which I shall speak in due time,&mdash; and yet, in the face of these constant expressions of His humility, to charge Him with presumption because He calls God His Father, as when He says, <em>Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up</em> , or, <em>You have made my Father's house an house of merchandise</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330794"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;2:16</a></span> I can conceive of no one foolish enough to regard His assertion, consistently made, that God is His Father, not as the simple <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> sincerely stated from certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but as a bold and baseless claim. We cannot denounce this constantly professed humility as an insolent demand for the rights of another, a laying of hands on what is not His own, an appropriation of powers which only God can wield. Nor, when He calls Himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as in, <em>For God sent not His Son into this world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved</em> , and in, <em>Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em>  <em>? </em>can we accuse Him of what would be an equal presumption with that of calling God His Father. But what else is it than such an accusation, if we allow to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the name of Son by adoption only? Do we not charge Him, when He calls God His Father, with daring to make a baseless claim? The Father's voice from heaven says <em>Hear Him</em>. I hear Him saying, <em>Father, I thank You</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330797"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse41">John&nbsp;11:41</a></span>, and <em>Say ye that I <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>, because l said, I am the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em>  <em>? </em>If I may not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> these names, and assume that they mean what they assert, how am I to trust and to understand? No hint is given of an alternative meaning. The Father bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> from heaven, <em>This is My Son; </em>the Son on His part speaks of <em>My Father's house</em>, and <em>My Father</em>. The confession of that name gives <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, when <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is demanded in the question, <em>Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? </em>The pronoun <em>My </em>indicates that the noun which follows belongs to the speaker. What right, I demand, have you <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to suppose it otherwise? You contradict the Father's word, the Son's assertion; you empty language of its meaning, and distort the words of God into a sense they cannot bear. On you alone rests the guilt of this shameless <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, that God has lied concerning Himself.</p>

<p>26. And thus, although nothing but a sincere belief that these names are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> significant,&mdash; that, when we read, <em>This is My Son </em>and <em>My Father</em>, the words really indicate Persons of Whom, and to Whom, they were spoken&mdash; can make them intelligible, yet, lest it be supposed that <em>Son </em>and <em>Father </em>are titles the one merely of adoption, the other merely of dignity, let us see what are the attributes attached, by the Son Himself, to His name of Son. He says, <em>All things are delivered Me of My Father, and no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Son but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> any the Father save the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he to Whom the Son will reveal Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330799"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span> Are the words of which we are speaking, <em>This is My Son </em>and <em>My Father</em>, consistent, or are they not, with <em>No one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Son but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> any the Father save the Son? </em>For it is only by <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> mutually borne that the Son can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father through the Son. We hear the voice from heaven; we hear also the words of the Son. We have as little excuse for not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as we have for not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the Father. All things are delivered unto Him; from this <em>All </em>there is no exception. If They possess an equal might; if They share an equal mutual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, hidden from us; if these names of Father and Son express the relation between Them, then, I demand, are They not in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> what They are in name, wielders of the same omnipotence, shrouded in the same impenetrable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>? God does not speak in order to deceive. The Fatherhood of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the Sonship of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, are literal truths. And now learn how facts bear out the verities which these names reveal.</p>

<p>27. The Son speaks thus:&mdash; <em>For the works which the Father has given Me to finish, the same works which I do, bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Me that the Father has sent Me; and the Father Himself which has sent Me has borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330800"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;5:36-37</a></span> God the Only-begotten proves His Sonship by an appeal not only to the name, but to the power; the works which He does are evidence that He has been sent by the Father. What, I ask, is the fact which these works prove? That He was sent. That He was sent, is used as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His sonlike <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> and of His Father's authority: for the works which He does could not possibly be done by any other than Him Who is sent by the Father. Yet the evidence of His works fails to convince the unbelieving that the Father sent Him. For He proceeds, <em>And the Father Himself which has sent Me has borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Me; and you have neither heard His voice nor seen His shape</em>.  What was this <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the Father concerning Him? Turn over the pages of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and review their contents. Read us other of the attestations given by the Father beside those which we have heard already; <em>This is My beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in Whom I am well pleased, and You are My Son</em>. John, who heard these words, needed them not, for He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> already. It was for our instruction that the Father spoke. But this is not all. John in the wilderness was honoured with this revelation; the Apostles were not to be denied the same assurance. It came to them in the very same words, but with an addition which John did not receive. He had been a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> from the womb, and needed not the commandment, <em>Hear Him</em>. Yes; I will hear Him, and will hear none but Him and His Apostle, who heard for my instruction. Even though the books contained no further <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, borne by the Father to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, than that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, I have, for confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the evidence of His Father's works which He does. What is this modern <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> that His name is a gift by adoption, His Godhead a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, His titles a pretence? We have the Father's <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to His Sonship; by works, equal to the Father's, the Son bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to His own equality with the Father. Why such blindness to His obvious possession of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Sonship which He both claims and displays. It is not through condescending kindness on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father that Christ bears the name of Son; not by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> that He has earned the title, as many have won it by enduring hardness in confession of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Such sonship is not of right; it is by a favour, worthy of Himself, that God bestows the title. But that which is indicated by <em>This</em>, and <em>My</em>, and <em>Hear Him</em>, is different in kind from the other. It is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and real and genuine Sonship.</p>

<p>28. And indeed the Son never makes for Himself a lower claim than is contained in this designation, given Him by His Father. The Father's words, <em>This is My Son</em>, reveal His nature; those which follow, <em>Hear Him</em>, are a summons to us to listen to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which He came down from heaven to bring; to learn that, if we would be saved, our confession must be a copy of His teaching. And in like manner the Son Himself teaches us, in words of His own, that He was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> came&mdash; <em>You neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Me, nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye whence I am, for I am not come of Myself, but He that sent Me is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, Whom ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, for I am from Him, and He has sent Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330802"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;7:28-29</a></span> No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father; the Son often assures us of this. The reason why He says that none <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him but Himself, is that He is from the Father. Is it, I ask, as the result of an act of creation, or of a genuine birth, that He is from Him? If it be an act of creation, then all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. How then is it that none of them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when the Son says that the reason why He has this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is that He is from Him? If He be created, not born, we shall observe in Him a resemblance to other beings who are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Since all, on this supposition, are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why is He not as <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the Father as are the others? But if this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father be peculiar to Him, Who is from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, must not this circumstance also, that He is from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, be peculiar to Him? That is, must He not be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son born from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God? For the reason why He alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> God is that He alone is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You observe, then, a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is peculiar to Himself, resulting from a birth which also is peculiar to Himself. You recognise that it is not by an act of creative power, but through a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth, that He is from the Father; and that this is why He alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who is unknown to all other beings which are from Him.</p>

<p>29. But He immediately adds, <em>For I am from Him, and He has sent Me</em>, to debar <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> from the violent assumption that His being from God dates from the time of His Advent. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> revelation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> proceeds in a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> sequence; first He is born, then He is sent. Similarly, in the previous declaration, we were told of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> , first as to Who He is, and then as to whence He is. For the words, <em>I am from Him, and He has sent Me</em>, contain two separate statements, as also do the words, <em>You neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Me, nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye whence I am</em>. Every man is born in the flesh; yet does not universal consciousness make every man spring from God? How then can Christ assert that either He, or the source of His being, is unknown? He can only do so by assigning His immediate parentage to the ultimate Author of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and, when He has done this, He can demonstrate their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of God by their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the fact that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Let the victims of this wretched delusion reflect upon the words, <em>You neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Me, nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye whence I am</em>. All things, they argue, are from nothing; they allow of no exception. They even dare to misrepresent God the Only-begotten as sprung from nothing. How can we explain this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and of the origin of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, on the part of the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a>? The very fact that, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whence He is, is an indication of that unknowable origin from which He springs. If we can say of a thing that it came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> out of nothing, then we are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of its origin; we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it was made out of nothing, and this is a piece of definite <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Now He Who came is not the Author of His own being; but He Who sent Him is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, Whom the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. He it was Who sent Him; and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not that He was the Sender. Thus the Sent is from the Sender; from Him Whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not as His Author. The reason why they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not Who Christ is, is that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not from Whom He is. None can confess the Son who denies that He was born; none can understand that He was born who has formed the opinion that He is from nothing. And indeed He is so far from being made out of nothing, that the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> cannot tell whence He is.</p>

<p>30. They are blankly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> who separate the Divine name from the Divine nature; <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and content to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. But let them listen to the reproof which the Son inflicts upon unbelievers for their want of this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said that God was their Father:&mdash; <em>If God were your Father, you </em> <em>would surely <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Me; for I went forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have come; neither am I come of Myself, but He sent Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330804"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse42">John&nbsp;8:42</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has here no word of blame for the devout confidence of those who combine the confession that He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, with their own claim to be God's sons. What He is blaming is the insolence of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in daring to claim God as their Father, when meanwhile they did not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, the Son:&mdash; <em>If God were your Father, you would surely <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Me; for I went forth from God</em>. All, who have God for their Father through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, have Him for Father through that same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby we confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But to confess that He is the Son in a sense which covers the whole company of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; to say, in effect, that He is one of the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;what <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is there in that? Are not all the rest, feeble created beings though they be, in that sense sons? In what does the eminence of a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which has confessed that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, consist, if He, as one of a multitude of sons, have the name only, and not the nature, of the Son? This unbelief has no <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Christ; it is a mockery of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for these perverters of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to claim God as their Father. If He were their Father, they would <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ because He had gone forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And now I must enquire the meaning of this going forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. His going forth is obviously different from His coming, for the two are mentioned side by side in this passage, <em>I went forth from God and have come</em>. In order to elucidate the separate meanings of <em>I went forth from God </em>and <em>I have come</em>, He immediately subjoins, <em>Neither am I come of Myself, but He sent Me</em>. He tells us that He is not the source of His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in the words, <em>Neither am I come of Myself</em>. In them He tells us that He has proceeded forth a second time from God , and has been sent by Him. But when He tells us that they who call God their Father must <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Himself because He has gone forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He makes His birth the reason for their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. <em>Went forth </em>carries back our thoughts to the incorporeal birth, for it is by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who was born from Him, that we must gain the right of devoutly claiming God for our Father. For when the Son says, <em>He that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> Me <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> My Father also</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330806"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;15:23</a></span>, this <em>My </em>is the assertion of a relation to the Father which is shared by none. On the other hand, He condemns the man who claims God as his Father, and loves not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as using a wrongful liberty with the Father's name; since he who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> Him, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, must <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the Father also, and none can be devoted to the Father save those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Son. For the one and only reason which He gives for loving the Son is His origin from the Father. The Son, therefore, is from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, not by His Advent, but by His birth ; and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the Father is only possible to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Son is from Him.</p>

<p>31. To this the Lord's words bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>&mdash; <em>I will not say unto you that I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the Father for you, for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that I went forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have come from the Father into this world</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330808"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;16:26-28</a></span> A complete <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, which accepts and loves the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that He went forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has access to the Father without need of His intervention. The confession that the Son was born and sent from God wins for it direct audience and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> from Him. Thus the narrative of His birth and coming must be taken in the strictest and most literal sense. <em>I went forth from God</em>, He says, conveying that His nature is exactly that which was given Him by His birth; for what being but God could go forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, could enter upon <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by birth from Him? Then He continues, <em>And have come from the Father into this world</em>. To assure us that this going forth from God means birth from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He tells us that He came from the Father into this world. The latter statement refers to His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, the former to His nature. And again, His putting on record first the fact of His going forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and then His coming from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, forbids us to identify the going with the coming. Coming from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and going forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are not synonymous; they might be paraphrased as 'Birth' and 'Presence,' and are as different in meaning as these. It is one thing to have gone forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and entered by birth upon a substantial <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; another to have come from the Father into this world to accomplish the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>32. In the order of our defence, as I have arranged it in my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, this has seemed the most convenient place for proving that, thirdly , the Apostles <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, not merely in name but in nature, not by adoption but by birth. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that there remain unmentioned many and most weighty words of God the Only-begotten concerning Himself, in which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His Divine birth is set so clearly forth as to silence any whisper of objection. Yet since it would be unwise to burden the reader's mind with an accumulation of evidence, and ample <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> has been already given of the genuineness of His birth, I will hold back the remainder of His utterances till later stages of our enquiry. For we have so arranged the course of our argument that now, after hearing the Father's <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> and the Son's self-revelation, we are to be instructed by the Apostles' <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and, as we must confess, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. We must see whether they could find in the words of the Lord, <em>I went forth from God</em>, any other meaning than this, that there was in Him a birth of the Divine nature.</p>

<p>33. After many dark sayings, spoken in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> by Him Whom they already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> as the Christ foretold by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the Prophets, Whom Nathanael had confessed as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and King of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, Who had Himself reproached Philip, in his question about the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for not perceiving, by the works which He did, that the Father was in Him and He in the Father; after He had already often taught them that He was sent from the Father; still, it was not till they had heard Him assert that He had gone forth from God that they confessed, in the words which immediately follow in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>&mdash; <em>His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> say unto Him, Now do You speak plainly, and speakest no proverb. Now therefore we are sure that You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things, and needest not that any man should ask You; by this we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that You went forth from God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330810"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;16:29-30</a></span> What was there so marvellous in this form of words, <em>Went forth from God</em>, which He had used? Had ye seen, O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed men, who for the reward of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> have received the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> and power to bind and to loose in heaven and earth, works so great, so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Divine, wrought by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and do ye yet profess that it was not until He had first told you that He had gone forth from God that you attained the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? And yet ye had seen water at the marriage turned into the marriage wine; one nature becoming another nature, whether it were by change, or by development, or by creation. And your hands had broken up the five loaves into a meal for that great multitude, and when all were satisfied ye had found that twelve baskets were needed to contain the fragments of the loaves; a small quantity of matter, in the process of relieving hunger, had multiplied into a great quantity of matter of the same nature. And ye had seen withered hands recover their suppleness, the tongues of dumb men loosened into speech, the feet of the lame made swift to run, the eyes of the blind endowed with vision, and life restored to the dead. Lazarus, who stank already, had risen to his feet at a word. He was summoned from the tomb and instantly came forth, without a pause between the word and its fulfilment. He was standing before you, a living man, while yet the air was carrying the odour of death to your nostrils. I speak not of other exertions of His mighty, His Divine powers. And is it, in spite of all this, only after ye heard Him say, <em>I went forth from God</em>, that you understood Who He is that had been sent from heaven? Is this the first time that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> had been told you without a proverb? The first time that the powers of His nature made it manifest to you that He went forth from God? And this in spite of His silent scrutiny of the purposes of your will, of His needing not to ask you concerning anything as though He were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, of His universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? For all these things, done in the power and in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are evidence that He must have gone forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>34. By this the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles did not understand that He had gone forth, in the sense of having been sent, from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For they had often heard Him confess, in His earlier discourses, that He was sent; but what they hear now is the express statement that He had gone forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This opens their eyes to perceive from His works His Divine nature. The fact that He had gone forth from God makes clear to them His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity, and so they say, <em>Now therefore we are sure that You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things, and needest not that any man should ask You; by this we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that You went forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </em>The reason why they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He went forth from God is that He both can, and does, perform the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Their perfect assurance of His Divine nature is the result of their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, not that He has come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that He did go forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Accordingly we find that it is this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, now heard for the first time, which clenches their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The Lord had made two statements; <em>I went forth from God</em>, and <em>I have come from the Father into this world</em>. One of these, <em>I have come from the Father into this world</em>, they had often heard, and it awakens no surprise. But their reply makes it manifest that they now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and understand the other, that is, <em>I went forth </em> <em>from God</em>. Their answer, <em>By this we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that You went forth from God</em>, is a response to it, and to it only; they do not add, 'And has come from the Father into this world.' The one statement is welcomed with a declaration of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; the other is passed over in silence. The confession was wrung from them by the sudden presentation of a new <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which convinced their reason and constrained them to avow their certainty. They <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> already that He, like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, could do all things; but His birth, which accounted for that omnipotence, had not been revealed. They <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He had been sent from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that He had gone forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now at last, taught by this utterance to understand the ineffable and perfect birth of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, they confess that He had spoken to them without a proverb.</p>

<p>35. For God is not born from God by the ordinary process of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> childbirth; this is no case of one being issuing from another by the exertion of natural forces. That birth is pure and perfect and stainless; indeed, we must call it rather a proceeding forth than a birth. For it is One from One; no partition, or withdrawing, or lessening, or efflux, or extension, or suffering of change, but the birth of living nature from living nature. It is God going forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not a creature picked out to bear the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> did not take its beginning out of nothing, but went forth from the Eternal; and this going forth is rightly entitled a birth, though it would be false to call it a beginning. For the proceeding forth of God from God is a thing entirely different from the coming into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a new substance. And though our apprehension of this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which is ineffable, cannot be defined in words, yet the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as He reveals to us that He went forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, imparts to it the certainty of an assured <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>36. A belief that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is Son in name only and not in nature, is not the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and of the Apostles. If this be a mere title, to which adoption is His only claim; if He be not the Son in virtue of having proceeded forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whence, I ask, was it that the blessed Simon Bar-Jona confessed to Him, <em>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330811"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;16:16</a></span> <em>? </em>Because He shared with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> the power of being born as one of the sons of God through the sacrament of regeneration? If Christ be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> only in this titular way, what was the revelation made to Peter, not by flesh and blood, but by the Father in heaven? What praise could he deserve for making a declaration which was universally applicable? What credit was due to Him for stating a fact of general <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? If He be Son by adoption, wherein lay the blessedness of Peter's confession, which offered a tribute to the Son to which, in that case, He had no more title than any member of the company of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>? The Apostle's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> penetrates into a region closed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasoning. He had, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, often heard, <em>He that receives you receives Me, and He that receives Me receives Him that sent Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330812"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;10:40</a></span> Hence he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> well that Christ had been sent; he had heard Him, Whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to have been sent, making the declaration, <em>All things are delivered unto Me of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Son but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> any one the Father save the Son</em>.  What then is this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which the Father now reveals to Peter, which receives the praise of a blessed confession? It cannot have been that the names of 'Father' and 'Son' were novel to him; he had heard them often. Yet he speaks words which the tongue of man had never framed before:&mdash; <em>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living God</em>. For though Christ, while dwelling in the body, had avowed Himself to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, yet now for the first time the Apostle's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had recognised in Him the presence of the Divine nature. Peter is praised not merely for his tribute of adoration, but for his recognition of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for confessing not Christ only, but Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. It would clearly have sufficed for a payment of reverence, had he said, <em>You are the Christ</em>, and nothing more. But it would have been a hollow confession, had Peter only hailed Him as Christ, without confessing Him the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And so his words <em>You are</em> declare that what is asserted of Him is strictly and exactly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to His nature. Next, the Father's utterance, <em>This is My Son</em>, had revealed to Peter that he must confess <em>You are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em>, for in the words <em>This is</em>, God the Revealer points Him out, and the response, <em>You are</em>, is the believer's welcome to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And this is the rock of confession whereon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is built. But the perceptive faculties of flesh and blood cannot attain to the recognition and confession of this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It is a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, Divinely revealed, that Christ must be not only named, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Was it only the Divine name; was it not rather the Divine nature that was revealed to Peter? If it were the name, he had heard it often from the Lord, proclaiming Himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. What <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, then, did he deserve for announcing the name? No; it was not the name; it was the nature, for the name had been repeatedly proclaimed.</p>

<p>37. This <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is which is the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; through this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> cannot prevail against her. This is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which has the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. Whatsoever this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall have loosed or bound on earth shall be loosed or bound in heaven. This <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the Father's gift by revelation; even the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that we must not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> a false Christ, a creature made out of nothing, but must confess Him the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> possessed of the Divine nature. What <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> and pitiful folly is it, that will not heed the venerable age and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of that blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, Peter himself, for whom the Father was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might not fail in <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>; who twice repeated the declaration of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for God that was demanded of him, and was grieved that he was tested by a third renewal of the question, as though it were a doubtful and wavering devotion, and then, because this third trial had cleansed him of his infirmities, had the reward of hearing the Lord's commission, <em>Feed My sheep</em>, a third time repeated; who, when all the Apostles were silent, alone recognised by the Father's revelation the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and won the pre-eminence of a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> beyond the reach of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty by his confession of his blissful <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>! What are the conclusions forced upon us by the study of his words? He confessed that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; you, lying <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the new apostolate, thrust upon us your modern notion that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a creature, made out of nothing. What <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> is this, that so distorts the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> words? The very reason why he is blessed is that he confessed the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. This is the Father's revelation, this the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, this the assurance of her permanence. Hence has she the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, hence judgment in heaven and judgment on earth. Through revelation Peter learned the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> hidden from the beginning of the world, proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, published the Divine nature, confessed the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. He who would deny all this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and confess Christ a creature, must first deny the apostleship of Peter, his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, his blessedness, his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. And when he has done all this, he must learn that he has severed himself from Christ; for it was by confessing Him that Peter won these glories.</p>

<p>38. Do you think, wretched <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> of today, that Peter would have been the more blessed now, if he had said, 'You are Christ, God's perfect creature, His handiwork, though excelling all His other works. Your beginning was from nothing, and through the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who alone is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, the name of Son has been given You by adoption, although in fact You were not born from God.' What answer, think you, would have been given to such words as these, when this same Peter's reply to the announcement of the Passion, <em>Be it far from You, Lord; this shall not be</em>, was rebuked with, <em>Get behind Me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, you are an offense unto Me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330815"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;16:22-23</a></span> <em>?</em> Yet  Peter could plead his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in extenuation of his guilt, for as yet the Father had not revealed all the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Passion; still, mere defect of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was visited with this stern condemnation. Now, why was it that the Father did not reveal to Peter your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> confession, this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in an adopted creature? I fancy that God must have grudged him the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; that He wanted to postpone it to a later age, and keep it as a novelty for your modern preachers. Yes; you may have a change of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if the keys of heaven are changed. You may have a change of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if there is a change in that Church against which the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail. You may have a change of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if there shall be a fresh apostolate, binding and loosing in heaven what it has bound and loosed on earth. You may have a change of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if another Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, beside the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Christ, shall be preached. But if that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which confesses Christ as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> only, received in Peter's person every accumulated blessing, then perforce the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which proclaims Him a creature, made out of nothing, holds not the keys of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and is a stranger to the apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and power. It is neither the Church's  <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nor is it Christ's.</p>

<p>39. Let us therefore cite every example of a statement of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> made by an Apostle. All of them, when they confess the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, confess Him not as a nominal and adoptive Son, but as Son by possession of the Divine nature. They never degrade Him to the level of a creature, but assign Him the splendour of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> birth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Let John speak to us, while he is waiting, just as he is, for the coming of the Lord; John, who was left behind and appointed to a destiny hidden in the counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for he is not told that he shall not die, but only that he shall tarry. Let him speak to us in his own familiar voice:&mdash; <em>No one has seen God at </em> <em>any time, except the Only-begotten Son, Which is in the bosom of the Father</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330818"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;1:18</a></span> It seemed to him that the name of Son did not set forth with sufficient distinctness His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity, unless he gave an external support to the peculiar majesty of Christ by indicating the difference between Him and all others. Hence he not only calls Him the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but adds the further designation of the <em>Only-begotten</em>, and so cuts away the last prop from under this imaginary adoption. For the fact that He is Only-begotten is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> positive of His right to the name of Son.</p>

<p>40. I defer the consideration of the words, <em>which is in the bosom of the Father</em>, to a more appropriate place. My present enquiry is into the sense of <em>Only-begotten</em>, and the claim upon us which that sense may make. And first let us see whether the word mean, as you assert, a perfect creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <em>Only-begotten </em>being equivalent to perfect, and <em>Son </em>a synonym for creature. But John described the Only-begotten Son as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not as a perfect creature. His words, <em>Which is in the bosom of the Father</em>, show that he anticipated these <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> designations; and, indeed, he had heard his Lord say, <em>For God so loved the world that He gave His Only-begotten Son, that whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Him should not perish but have everlasting life</em>.  <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who loved the world, gave His Only-begotten Son as a manifest token of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. If the evidence of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> be this, that He bestowed a creature upon creatures, gave a worldly being on the world's behalf, granted one raised up from nothing for the redemption of objects equally raised up from nothing, this cheap and petty <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is a poor assurance of His favour towards us. Gifts of price are the evidence of affection: the greatness of the surrender of the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who loved the world, gave not an adopted Son, but His own, His Only-begotten. Here is personal interest, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Sonship, sincerity; not creation, or adoption, or pretence. Herein is the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and affection, that He gave His own, His Only-begotten Son.</p>

<p>41. I appeal not now to any of the titles which are given to the Son; there is no loss in delay when it is the result of an embarrassing abundance of choice. My present argument is that a successful result implies a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; some clear and cogent motive must underlie every effectual performance. And so the Evangelist has been <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to reveal his motive in writing. Let us see what is the purpose which he confesses;&mdash; <em>But these things are written that you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330820"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;20:31</a></span> The one reason which he alleges for writing his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is that all may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. If it be sufficient for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, why does he add <em>The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? </em>But if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be nothing less than the belief that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not merely Christ, but Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, then assuredly the name of Son is not attached to Christ as a customary appendage due to adoption, seeing that it is essential to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. If then <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> consists in the confession of the name, must not the name express the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? If the name express the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, by what authority can He be called a creature? It is not the confession of a creature, but the confession of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, which shall give us <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>42. To <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, is the acceptable service of an unfeigned <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For we have no <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> within us towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father except through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Son. Let us hear Him speaking to us in the words of the Epistle;&mdash; <em>Every one that loves the Father loves Him that is born from Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330821"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:1</a></span> What, I ask, is the meaning of being born from Him? Can it mean, perchance, being created by Him? Does the Evangelist lie in saying that He was born from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> more correctly teaches that He was created? Let us all listen to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> character of this teacher of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. It is written, <em>He is antichrist, that denies the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a></em>.  What will you do now, champion of the creature, conjurer up of a novel Christ out of nothing? Hear the title which awaits you, if you persist in your assertion. Or do you think that perhaps you may still describe the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> as Creator and Creature, and yet by an ingenious ambiguity of language escape being recognised as antichrist? If your confession embraces a Father in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense, and a Son in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense, then I am a slanderer, assailing you with a title of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> which you have not deserved. But if in your confession all Christ's attributes are spurious and nominal, and not His own, then learn from the Apostle the right description of such a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as yours; and hear what is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which believes in the Son. The words which follow are these&mdash; <em>He that denies the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the same has not the Father: he that confesses the Son has both the Son and the Father</em>.  He that denies the Son is destitute of the Father; he that confesses and has the Son has the Father also. What room is there here for adoptive names? Does not every word tell of the Divine nature? Learn how completely that nature is present.</p>

<p>43. John speaks thus&mdash; <em>For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has come, and was incarnate for us, and suffered, and rose again from the dead and took us for Himself, and gave us a good understanding that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him that is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and may be in His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and our resurrection</em>.  Wisdom doomed to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> end, void of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, destined to possess the spirit and the name of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, blind to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> came to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and unworthy in that blindness to perceive the light of that sovereign <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>! For this wisdom asserts that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but a creature of His, Who bears the Divine name by adoption. In what dark oracle of hidden <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was the secret learned? To whose research do we owe this, the great discovery of the day? Were you he that lay upon the bosom of the Lord? You he to whom in the familiar intercourse of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> He revealed the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>? Was it you that alone followed Him to the foot of the Cross? And while He was charging you to receive Mary as your Mother, did He teach you this secret, as the token of His peculiar <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for yourself? Or did you run to the Sepulchre, and reach it sooner even than Peter, and so gain this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> there? Or was it amid the throngs of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and sealed books whose clasps none can open, and manifold influences of the signs of heaven, and unknown songs of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> choirs, that the Lamb, your Guide, revealed to you this godly doctrine, that the Father is no Father, the Son no Son, nor nature, nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? For you transform all these into lies. The Apostle, by that most excellent <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that was granted him, speaks of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. You assert His creation, proclaim His adoption, deny His birth. While the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life and resurrection to us, for him, in whose eyes He is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, there is neither <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life nor resurrection. And this is the lesson taught by John, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> beloved of the Lord.</p>

<p>44. And the persecutor, who was converted to be an Apostle and a chosen vessel, delivers the very same message. What discourse is there of his which does not presuppose the confession of the Son? What Epistle of his that does not begin with a confession of that <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? When he says, <em>We were reconciled to God by the death of His Son</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330825"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;5:10</a></span>, and, <em>God sent His Son to be the likeness of the flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note330826"><!--k28--<a href="../bible/1jo008.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;8:3</a></span>, and again, <em>God is faithful, by Whom you were called unto the fellowship of His Son</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330827"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:9</a></span>, is any loophole left for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> misrepresentation? <em>His Son, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; </em>so we read, but nothing is said of His adoption, or of God's creature. The name expresses the nature; He is God's Son, and therefore the Sonship is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. The Apostle's confession asserts the genuineness of the relation. I see not how the Divine nature of the Son could have been more completely stated. That Chosen Vessel has proclaimed in no weak or wavering voice that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Son of Him Who, as we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, is the Father. The Teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, has left us no uncertainty, no opening for <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in his presentation of the doctrine. He is quite clear upon the subject of children by adoption; of those who by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> attain so to be and so to be named. in his own words, <em>For as many as are led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, they are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again unto <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330828"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;8:14-15</a></span> This is the name granted to us, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, through the sacrament of regeneration; our confession of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> wins us this adoption. For our work done in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> gives us the title of sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <em>Abba, Father</em>, is the cry which we raise, not the expression of our essential nature. For that essential nature of ours is untouched by that tribute of the voice. It is one thing for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be addressed as Father; another thing for Him to be the Father of His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</p>

<p>45. But now let us learn what is this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, which the Apostle holds. For though there is no single discourse, among the many which he delivered concerning the Church's doctrine, in which he mentions the Father without also making confession of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, yet, in order to display the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the relation which that name conveys with the utmost definiteness of which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> language is capable, he speaks thus:&mdash; <em>What then? If God be for us, who can be against us? Who spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us</em>.  Can <em>Son</em>, by any remaining possibility, be a title received through adoption, when He is expressly called God's own Son? For the Apostle, wishing to make manifest the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God towards us, uses a kind of comparison, to enable us to estimate how great that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is, when He says that it was His own Son Whom God did not spare. He suggests the thought that this was no <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of an adopted Son, on behalf of those whom He purposed to adopt, of a creature for creatures, but of His Son for strangers, His own Son for those to whom He had willed to give a share in the name of sons. Seek out the full import of the term, that you may understand the extent of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Consider the meaning of <em>own; </em>mark the genuineness of the Sonship which it implies. For the Apostle now describes Him as God's own Son; previously he had often spoken of Him as God's Son, or <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And though many manuscripts, through a want of apprehension on the part of the translators, read in this passage <em>His Son</em>, instead of <em>His own Son</em>, yet the original Greek, the tongue in which the Apostle wrote, is more exactly rendered by <em>His own </em>than by <em>His</em>.  And though the casual reader may discern no great difference between <em>His own </em>and <em>His</em>, yet the Apostle, who in all his other statements had spoken of His Son, which is, in the Greek, <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F78;&#x03BD; &#x1F11;&#x03B1;&#x03C5;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x03C5;&#x1F31;&amp; 231<!--k29--&#183;&#x03BD;</span>, in this passage uses the words <span class="greek">&#x1F45;&#x03C2; &#x03B3;&#x03B5; &#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x1F30;&#x03B4;&#x1F77;&#x03BF;&#x03C5; &#x03C5;&#x1F31;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x03BF;&#x1F50;&#x03BA; &#x1F10;&#x03C6;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;</span>, that is, <em>Who spared not His own Son</em>, expressly and emphatically indicating His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divine nature. Previously he had declared that through the Spirit of adoption there are many sons; now his object is to point to God's own Son, God the Only-begotten.</p>

<p>46. This is no universal and inevitable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; they who deny the Son cannot lay the fault upon their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, for <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which they deny is impossible. They describe the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> as a creature who came into being out of nothing. If the Father has never asserted this, nor the Son confirmed it, nor the Apostles proclaimed it, then the dating which prompts their allegation is bred not of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for Christ. When the Father says of His Son, <em>This is</em> , and the Son of Himself, <em>It is He that talks with You</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330832"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;9:37</a></span>, and when Peter confesses <em>You are</em> , and John assures us, <em>This is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330834"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:20</a></span>, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is never weary of proclaiming Him as God's own Son, I can conceive of no other motive for this denial than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. The plea of want of familiarity with the subject cannot be urged in extenuation of their guilt. It is the suggestion of that Evil One, uttered now through these <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and forerunners of his coming; he will utter it himself hereafter when he comes as <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. He is using this novel engine of assault to shake us in our saving confession of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. His first object is to pluck from our hearts the confident assurance of the Divine nature of the Son; next, he would fill our minds with the notion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> adoption, and leave no room for the memory of His other claims. For they who hold that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is but a creature, must regard Christ as <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, since a creature cannot be God's own Son, and therefore He must lie in calling Himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Hence also they who deny that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> must have <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> for their Christ.</p>

<p>47. What is the hope of which this futile passion of yours is in pursuit? What is the assurance of your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which emboldens you with <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> licence of tongue to maintain that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a creature, and not a Son? It was your duty to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, and to hold the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> fast. For though the Lord can do all things, yet He resolved that every one who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for His effectual help must earn it by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> confession of Himself. Not, indeed, that the suppliant's confession could augment the power of Him, Who is the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but the earning was to be the reward of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. So, when He asked Martha, who was entreating Him for Lazarus, whether she <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that they who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him should not die <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, her answer expressed the trust of her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash; <em>Yea, Lord, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Who has come into this world</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330835"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;11:27</a></span> This confession is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. Martha, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for her brother's life, was asked whether she <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> this. She did so <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. What life does the denier expect, from whom does he hope to receive it, when this belief, and this only, is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life? For great is the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and perfect the blessedness which is the fruit of this confession.</p>

<p>48. The Lord had given sight to a man blind from his birth; the Lord of nature had removed a defect of nature. Because this blind man had been born for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that God's work might be made manifest in the work of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Lord did not delay till the man had given evidence of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by a confession of it. But though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not at the time Who it was that had bestowed the great gift of eyesight, yet afterwards he earned a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For it was not the dispelling of his blindness that won him <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. And so, when the man was already healed and had suffered ejection from the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, the Lord put to him the question, <em>Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note330836"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;9:35</a></span>? This was to save him from the thought of loss, in exclusion from the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, by the certainty that confession of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had restored him to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. When the man, his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> still unenlightened, made answer, <em>Who is He, Lord, that I may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him</em> ? The Lord's reply was, <em>You have both seen Him, and it is He that talks with you</em>. For He was minded to remove the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the man whose sight he had restored, and whom He was now enriching with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of so <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Does the Lord demand from this man, as from others, who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> Him to heal them, a confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as the price of their recovery? Emphatically not. For the blind man could already see when he was thus addressed. The Lord asked the question in order to receive the answer, <em>Lord, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a></em>.  The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which spoke in that answer was to receive not sight, but life.  And now let us examine carefully the force of the words. The Lord asks of the man, <em>Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? </em>Surely, if a simple confession of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, leaving His nature in obscurity, were a complete expression of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the terms of the question would have been, 'Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ.' But in days to come almost every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> was to make a parade of that name, confessing Christ and yet denying that He is the Son; and therefore He demands, as the condition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in what is peculiar to Himself, that is, in His Divine Sonship. What is the profit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, if it be <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in a creature, when He requires of us <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not the creature, but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>49. Did devils fail to understand the full meaning of this name of Son? For we are valuing the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> at their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worth if we refute them no longer by the teaching of Apostles, but out of the mouth of devils. They cry, and cry often, <em>What have I to do with You, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Thou <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> most High</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330840"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;8:28</a></span> <em>?</em> Truth wrung this confession from them against their will; their reluctant <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the force of the Divine nature within Him. When they fly from the bodies they have long possessed, it is His might that conquers them; their confession of His nature is an act of reverence. These transactions display Christ as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> both in power and in name. Can you hear, amid all these cries of devils confessing Him, Christ once styled a creature, or God's condescension in adopting Him once named?</p>

<p>50. If you will not learn Who Christ is from those that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, learn it at least from those that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him not. So shall the confession, which their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is forced to make, rebuke your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> did not recognise Christ, come in the body, though they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Christ must be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And so, when they were employing false witnesses, without one word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in their testimony, against Him, their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> asked Him, <em>Are  You the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the Blessed</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330841"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse61">Mark&nbsp;14:61</a></span> <em>? </em>They <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that in Him the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> was fulfilled; they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the Divine nature was the condition of its fulfilment. They did not ask whether Christ be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; they asked whether He were Christ, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. They were wrong as to the Person, not as to the Sonship, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. They did not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and thus, while they asked whether He were the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, they asked without denying that the Christ is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. What, then, of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which leads you to deny what even they, in their blindness, confessed? The perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is this, to be assured that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Who <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the worlds, was also born of the Virgin. Even they, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of His birth from Mary, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Mark the fellowship with Jewish <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in which your denial of the Divine Sonship has involved you! For they have put on record the reason of their condemnation:&mdash; <em>And by our Law He ought to die, because He made Himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330842"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse7">John&nbsp;19:7</a></span> Is not this the same charge which you are blasphemously bringing against Him, that, while you pronounce Him a creature, He calls Himself the Son? He confesses Himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and they declare Him guilty of death: you too deny that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. What sentence do you pass upon Him? You have the same repugnance to His claim as had the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. You agree with their verdict; I want to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether you will quarrel about the sentence. Your offense, in denying that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, is exactly the same as theirs, though their guilt is less, for they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. They <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that Christ was born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, yet they never <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that Christ must be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. You are perfectly aware of the fact that Christ was born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, yet you refuse Him the name of <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. If they come to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, there awaits them an un-imperilled <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, because of their past <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Every gate of safety is shut to you, because you persist in denying a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is obvious to you. For you are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it so well that you allow Him the name as a title of adoption, and feign that He is a creature adorned, like others, with the right to call Himself a Son. You rob Him, as far as you can, of the Divine nature; if you could, you would rob Him of the Divine name as well. But, because you cannot, you <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> the name from the nature; He is called a Son, but He shall not be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<p>51. The confession of the Apostles, for whom by a word of command the raging wind and troubled sea were restored to calm, was an opportunity for you. You might have confessed, as they did, that He is God's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son; you might have borrowed their very words, <em>Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, this is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330843"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;14:33</a></span> But an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> is driving you on to shipwreck of your life; your reason is distracted and overwhelmed, like the ocean tormented by the fury of the storm.</p>

<p>52. If this <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the voyagers seem inconclusive to you because they were Apostles,&mdash; though to me it comes with the greater weight for the same reason, though it surprises me the less&mdash;accept at any rate a corroboration given by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Hear how the soldier of the Roman cohort, one of the stern guard around the Cross, was humbled to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The centurion sees the mighty workings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> power; and this is the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> borne by him:&mdash; <em>Truly this was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330844"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse54">Matthew&nbsp;27:54</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was forced upon him, after Christ had given up the ghost, by the torn veil of the Temple, and the earth that shook, and the rocks that were rent, and the sepulchres that were opened, and the dead that rose. And it was the confession of an unbeliever. The <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that were done convinced him that Christ's nature was <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>; he names Him the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, being assured of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity. So cogent was the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, so strong the man's conviction, that the force of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> conquered his will, and even he who had nailed Christ to the Cross was driven to confess that He is the Lord of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>
