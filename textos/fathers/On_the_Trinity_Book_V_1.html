<h1>On the Trinity (Book V)</h1>

<div class="stiki"><p>Book V. Hilary now points out (&sect; 1) the controversial strength of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> position. If he is silent in face of their assertion, they will claim that he agrees with them that the Son is God only in some inferior sense. On the other hand, if he opposes them, he will seem to be contradicting the Mosaic revelation of the Divine unity. In &sect; 2 he recapitulates the argument of Book IV., that the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Scripture proves that God is not a solitary Person; that, as he says, there is <em>God and God</em>. But the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> had a further loophole; their creed asserted (&sect; 3) one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. They might argue that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is indeed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but of a nature different from that of the Father. In refutation of this Hilary goes once more through the history of creation (&sect;&sect; 4-10), proving that the narrative reveals not only the Son's share in that work, but also His equality and oneness of nature with the Father; in other words, that He is not only God but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. The same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is demonstrated from the life of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> (&sect;&sect; 11-16). Moreover, these self-revelations of the Son (as the Angel, on various occasions) are anticipations of the Incarnation. He was first seen in flesh, afterwards born in flesh. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> concentrate their attention on the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> conditions of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, and so, from want of a comprehensive view, fail to discern His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead. But Hilary will not anticipate the evidence of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> (&sect;&sect; 17, 18). He returns to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and proves his point from Jacob's visions (&sect;&sect; 19, 20), and by the revelations made to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> (&sect;&sect; 21-23). After a summary and an enforcement of the preceding arguments (&sect;&sect; 24, 25), he proceeds to prove from certain passages of Isaiah that the Prophet recognised the Son as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God (&sect;&sect; 26-31), and that St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> understood him in that sense (&sect;&sect; 32, 33). Then, in &sect;&sect; 34, 35, the result which has been attained is dwelt upon. Hilary shows that it is the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> who fail to recognise the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for Christ is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet not a second God. Finally, in &sect;&sect; 36-39, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, Isaiah, and Jeremiah are adduced as testifying that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p></div>

<p>1. Our reply, in the previous books, to the mad and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> has led us with open eyes into the difficulty that our readers incur an equal danger whether we refute our opponents, or whether we forbear. For while unbelief with boisterous irreverence was thrusting upon us the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a unity which devout and reasonable <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot deny, the scrupulous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was caught in the dilemma that, whether it asserted or denied the proposition, the danger of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> was equally incurred. To <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> logic it may seem ridiculous and irrational to say that it can be impious to assert, and impious to deny, the same doctrine, since what it is godly to maintain it must be godless to dispute; if it serve a good purpose to demolish a statement, it may seem folly to dream that good can come from supporting it. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> logic is fallacy in the presence of the counsels of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and folly when it would cope with the wisdom of heaven; its thoughts are fettered by its limitations, its <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> confined by the feebleness of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. It must be foolish in its own eyes before it can be wise unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that is, it must learn the poverty of its own faculties and seek after Divine wisdom. It must become wise, not by the standard of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, but of that which mounts to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before it can enter into His wisdom, and its eyes be opened to the folly of the world. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have ingeniously contrived that this folly, which passes for wisdom, shall be their engine. They employ the confession of One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for which they appeal to the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the Law and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> in the words, <em>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord your God is One</em>.  They are well aware of the risks involved, whether their assertion be met by contradiction or passed over in silence; and, whichever happens, they see an opening to promote their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. If sacred <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, pressed with a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> intent, be met by silence, that silence is construed as consent; as a confession that, because God is One, therefore His Son is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God abides in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> solitude. If, on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> involved in their bold argument be met by contradiction, this opposition is branded as a departure from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which states in precise terms the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or else they cast in the opponent's teeth that he has fallen into the contrary <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which allows but one Person of Father and of Son.  Such is the deadly artifice, wearing the aspect of an attractive innocence, which the world's wisdom, which is folly with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has forged to beguile us in this first article of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which we can neither confess nor deny without risk of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. We walk between dangers on either hand; the unity of God may force us into a denial of the Godhead of His Son, or, if we confess that the Father is God and the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we may be driven into the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of interpreting the unity of Father and of Son in the Sabellian sense. Thus their device of insisting upon the <em>One God </em>would either shut out the Second Person from the Godhead, or destroy the Unity by admitting Him as a second <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or else make the unity merely nominal. For unity, they would plead, excludes a Second; the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a Second is destructive of unity; and Two cannot be One.</p>

<p>2. But we who have attained this wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is folly to the world, and purpose, by means of the sound and saving profession of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, to unmask the snake-like treachery of their teaching; we have so laid out the plan of our undertaking as to gain a vantage ground for the display of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> without entangling ourselves in the dangers of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> assertion. We carefully avoid either extreme; not denying that God is One, yet setting forth distinctly, on the evidence of the Lawgiver who proclaims the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that there is God and God. We teach that it is by no confusion of the Two that God is One; we do not rend Him in pieces by preaching a plurality of Gods, nor yet do we profess a distinction only in name. But we present Him as God and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, postponing at present for fuller discussion hereafter the question of the Divine unity. For the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> tell us that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> taught the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> when he proclaimed that God is One; and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by his proclamation of One God confirms the lesson of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, which tell of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and God. Thus we do not contradict our authorities, but base our teaching upon them, proving that the revelation to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> of the unity of God gives no sanction to the refusal of Divinity to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; since he who is our authority for asserting that there is One God is our authority also for confessing the Godhead of His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</p>

<p>3. And so the arrangement of our treatise follows closely the order of the objections raised. Since the next article of their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> and dishonest confession is, <em>We confess One <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em> , the whole of this second  book is devoted to the question whether the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. For it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have ingeniously contrived this arrangement of first naming <em>One God </em>and then <em>One <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em>, in order to detach the Son from the name and nature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since the thought must suggest itself that, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> being inherent in the One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it must be strictly confined to Him. And therefore, since it is clear beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when he proclaimed the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, meant therein to assert the Divinity of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, let us return to the leading passages in which his teaching is conveyed, and enquire whether or no he wishes us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, Who, as he has taught us, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. It is clear that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or genuineness, of a thing is a question of its nature and its powers. For instance, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wheat is that which grows to a head with the beard bristling round it, which is purged from the chaff and ground to flour, compounded into a loaf and taken for food, and renders the nature and the uses of bread. Thus natural powers are the evidence of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and let us see, by this test, whether He, Whom <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> calls <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. We will defer for the present our discourse concerning this One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lest, if I fail at once to take up their challenge and uphold the One True God in the two Persons of Father and of Son, eager and anxious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> be oppressed by dangerous doubts.</p>

<p>4. And now, since we accept as common ground the fact that God recognises His Son as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I ask you: how does the creation of the world disprove our assertion that the Son is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God? There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that all things are through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, for, in the Apostle's words, <em>All things are through Him, and in Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330745"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse16">Colossians&nbsp;1:16</a></span> If all things are through Him, and all were made out of nothing, and none otherwise than through Him, in what element of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead is He defective, Who possesses both the nature and the power of God? He had at His disposal the powers of the Divine nature, to bring into being the non-existent and to create at His pleasure. For <em>God saw that they were good</em>. </p>

<p>5. When the Law says, <em>And God said, Let there be a firmament</em>, and then adds, <em>And God made the firmament</em>, it introduces no other distinction than that of Person. It indicates no difference of power or nature, and makes no change of name. Under the one title of <em>God </em>it reveals, first, the thought of Him Who spoke, and then the action of Him Who created. The language of the narrator says nothing to deprive Him of Divine nature and power; nay rather, how precisely does it inculcate His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead. The power to give effect to the word of creation belongs only to that Nature with Whom to speak is the same as to fulfil. How then is He not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who creates, if He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who commands? If the word spoken was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Divine, the deed done was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Divine also. God spoke, and God created; if it was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God Who spoke, He Who created was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God also; unless indeed, while the presence of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead was displayed in the speech of the One, its absence was manifested in the action of the Other. Thus in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> we behold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divine nature. He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He is Creator, He is <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, He is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>. It is not merely that He can do whatever He will, for will is always the concomitant of power; but He can do also whatever is commanded Him. Absolute power is this, that its possessor can execute as Agent whatever His words as Speaker can express. When unlimited power of expression is combined with unlimited power of execution, then this creative power, commensurate with the commanding word, possesses the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is not false <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor God by adoption, nor God by gift of the name, but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Nothing would be gained by the statement of the arguments by which His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead is opposed. His possession of the name and of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God is conclusive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. He, by Whom all things were made, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So much the creation of the world tells me about Him. He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, equal with God in name; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, equal with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God in power. The might of God is revealed to us in the creative word; the might of God is manifested also in the creative act. And now again I ask by what authority you deny, in your confession of Father and Son, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divine nature of Him Whose name reveals His power, Whose power proves His right to the Name.</p>

<p>6. My reader must bear in mind that I am silent about the current objections through no forgetfulness, and no distrust of my <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For that constantly cited text, <em>The Father is greater than I</em>, and its cognate passages are perfectly familiar to me, and I have my interpretation of them ready, which makes them <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divine nature of the Son. But it serves my purpose best to adhere in reply to the order of attack, that our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> effort may follow close upon the progress of their impious scheme, and when we see them diverge into godless <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> we may at once obliterate the track of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. To this end we postpone to the end of our work the testimony of the Evangelists and Apostles, and join battle with the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a> for the present on the ground of the Law and the Prophets, silencing their crooked argument, based on misinterpretation and deceit, by the very texts with which they strive to delude us. The sound method of demonstrating a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is to expose the fallacy of the objections raised against it; and the disgrace of the deceiver is complete if his own lie be converted into an evidence for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And, indeed, the universal experience of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> has learned that <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are incompatible, and cannot be reconciled or made coherent; that by their very nature they are among those opposites which are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> repugnant, and can never combine or agree.</p>

<p>7. This being the case, I ask how a distinction can be made in the words, <em>Let Us make man after Our own image and likeness</em>, between a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and a false. The words express a meaning, the meaning is the outcome of thought; the thought is set in motion by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Let us follow the words back to their meaning, and learn from the meaning the thought, and from the thought attain to the underlying <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Your enquiry is, whether He to Whom the words <em>Let Us make man after Our own image and likeness</em> were spoken, was not thought of as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> by Him Who spoke; for they undoubtedly express the feeling and thought of the Speaker. In saying <em>Let Us make</em>, He clearly indicates One in no discord with Himself, no alien or powerless Being, but One endowed with power to do the thing of which He speaks. His own words assure us that this is the sense in which we must understand that they were spoken.</p>

<p>8. To assure us still more fully of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead manifested in the nature and work of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, He, Who expressed His meaning in the words I have cited, shows that His thought was suggested by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity of Him to Whom He said, <em>After Our own image and likeness</em>. How is He <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God says, <em>After Our own image and likeness?</em> <em>Our </em>is inconsistent with isolation, and with difference either in purpose or in nature. Man is created, taking the words in their strict sense, in Their common image. Now there can be nothing common to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and to the false. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Speaker, is speaking to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; man is being created in the image of Father and of Son. The Two are One in name and One in nature. It is only one image after which man is made. The time has not yet come for me to discuss this matter; hereafter I will explain what is this image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and of God the Son into which man was created. For the present we will stick to the question, was, or was not, He <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God said, <em>Let Us make man after Our own image and likeness? </em>Separate, if you can, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> from the false elements in this image common to Both; in your <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> divide the indivisible. For They Two are One, of Whose one image and likeness man is the one copy.</p>

<p>9. But now let us continue our reading of this Scripture, to show how the consistency of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is unaffected by these dishonest objections. The next words are, <em>And God made man; after the image of God made He him</em>. The image is in common; God made man after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I would ask him who denies that God's Son is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in what God's image he supposes that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made man? He must bear constantly in mind that all things are through the Son; <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> ingenuity must not, for its own purposes, twist this passage into action on the part of the Father. If, therefore, man is created through God the Son after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, he is created also after the image of the Son; for all admit that the words <em>After Our image and likeness</em> were spoken to the Son. Thus His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead is as explicitly asserted by the Divine words as manifested in the Divine action; so that it is God Who moulds man into the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who reveals Himself as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, moreover, as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. For His joint possession of the Divine image proves Him <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while His creative action displays Him as God the Son.</p>

<p>10. What wild insanity of abandoned <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>! What blind audacity of reckless <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>! You hear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; you hear of <em>Our image</em>. Why suggest that One is, and One is not, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God? Why distinguish between God by nature and God in name? Why, under pretext of defending the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, do you destroy the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Why struggle to pervert the revelation of One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, One <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, into a denial that God is One and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>? Not yet will I stifle your insane efforts with the clear words of Evangelists and Prophets, in which Father and Son appear not as one Person, but as One in nature, and Each as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. For the present the Law, unaided, annihilates you. Does the Law ever speak of One <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and One not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>? Does it ever speak of Either, except by the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> expression of Their nature? It speaks of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; it speaks also of God as One. Nay, it does more than so describe Them. It manifests Them as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the sure evidence of Their joint image. It begins by speaking of Them first by their strict name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; then it attributes <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead to Both in common. For when man, Their creature, is created after the image of Both, sound reason forces the conclusion that Each of Them is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</p>

<p>11. But let us travel once more in our journey of instruction over the lessons taught in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The Angel of God speaks to Hagar; and this same Angel is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But perhaps His being the Angel of God means that He is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. For this title seems to indicate a lower nature; where the name points to a difference in kind, it is thought that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> equality must be absent. The last book has already exposed the hollowness of this objection; the title of Angel informs us of His office, not of His nature. I have prophetic evidence for this explanation; <em>Who makes His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> spirits, and His ministers a flaming fire</em>.  That flaming fire is His ministers; that spirit which comes, His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. These figures show the nature and the power of His messengers, or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and of His ministers. This spirit is an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, that flaming fire a minister, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Their nature adapts them for the function of messenger or minister. Thus the Law, or rather God through the Law, wishing to indicate God the Son as a Person, yet as bearing the same name with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, calls Him the Angel, that is, the Messenger, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The title <em>Messenger</em> proves that He has an office of His own; that His nature is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Divine is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> when He is called God. But this sequence, first Angel, then <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is in the order of revelation, not in Himself. For we confess Them Father and Son in the strictest sense, in such equality that the Only-begotten Son, by virtue of His birth, possesses <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity from the Unbegotten Father. This revelation of Them as Sender and as Sent is but another expression for Father and Son; not contradicting the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divine nature of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, nor cancelling His possession of the Godhead as His birthright. For none can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the Son by His birth partakes congenitally of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His Author, in such wise that from the One there comes into being an indivisible Unity, because One is from One.</p>

<p>12. Faith burns with passionate ardour; the burden of silence is intolerable, and my thoughts imperiously demand an utterance. Already, in the preceding book I have departed from the intended method of my demonstration. I was denouncing that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> sense in which the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> speak of One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and expounding the passages in which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> speaks of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and God. I hastened on with a precipitate, though devout, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense in which we hold the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And now again, wrapped up in the pursuit of another enquiry, I have suffered myself to wander from the course, and, while I was engaged upon the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the ardour of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has hurried me on before the time to make the confession of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God as Father and as Son. But our own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> must wait its proper place in the treatise. This preliminary statement of it has been made as a safeguard for the reader; it shall be so developed and explained hereafter as to frustrate the schemes of the gainsayer.</p>

<p>13. To resume the argument; this title of office indicates no difference of nature, for He, Who is the Angel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The test of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead shall be, whether or no His words and acts were those of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He increases Ishmael into a great people, and promises that many nations shall bear his name. Is this, I ask, within an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> power? If not, and this is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why do you refuse <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity to Him Who, on your own confession, has the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> power of God? Thus He possesses the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect powers of the Divine nature. True <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in all the types in which He reveals Himself for the world's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, is not, nor ever can be, other than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</p>

<p>14. Now first, I ask, what is the meaning of these terms, '<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God?' and 'not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God?'? If any one says to me 'This is fire, but not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fire; water, but not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> water,' I can attach no intelligible meaning to his words. What difference in kind can there be between one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> specimen, and another <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> specimen, of the same class? If a thing be fire, it must be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fire; while its nature remains the same it cannot lose this character of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fire. Deprive water of its watery nature, and by so doing you destroy it as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> water; let it remain water, and it will inevitably still be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> water. The only way in which an object can lose its nature is by losing its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; if it continue to exist it must be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> itself. If the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; if He is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then in no possible sense is He God at all. If He has not the nature, then He has no right to the name; if, on the contrary, the name which indicates the nature is His by inherent right, then it cannot be that He is destitute of that nature in its truest sense.</p>

<p>15. But perhaps it will be argued that, when the Angel of God is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He receives the name as a favour, through adoption, and has in consequence a nominal, not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, Godhead. If He gave us an inadequate revelation of His Divine nature at the time when He was styled the Angel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, judge whether He has not fully manifested His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead under the name of a nature lower than the angelic. For a Man spoke to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> worshipped Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Pestilent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>! <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> confessed Him, you deny Him, to be God. What hope is there for you, in your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, of the blessings promised to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>? He is Father of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, but not for you; you cannot go forth from your regeneration to join the household of his seed, through the blessings given to his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. You are no son, raised up to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> from the stones; you are a generation of vipers, an adversary of his belief. You are not the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the heir of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for you have disbelieved <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was justified and appointed to be the Father of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> through that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> wherein he worshipped the God Whose word he trusted. God it was Whom that blessed and faithful Patriarch worshipped then; and mark how <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Whom, in His own words, all things are possible. Is there any, but God alone, to Whom nothing is impossible? And He, to Whom all things are possible, does He fall short of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity?</p>

<p>16. I ask further, Who is this God Who overthrew <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>? For <em>the Lord rained from the Lord</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330748"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;19:24</a></span>; was it not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lord from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lord? Have you any alternative to this Lord, and Lord? Or any other meaning for the terms, except that in Lord, and Lord, their Persons are distinguished? Bear in mind that Him Whom you have confessed as <em>Alone <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a></em>, you have also confessed as <em>Alone the righteous Judge</em>.  Now mark that the Lord who rains from the Lord, and slays not the just with the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, and judges the whole earth, is both Lord and also righteous Judge, and also rains from the Lord. In the face of all this, I ask you Which it is that you describe as alone the righteous Judge. The Lord rains from the Lord; you will not deny that He Who rains from the Lord is the righteous Judge, for <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the Father of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>&mdash; but not of the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>&mdash; speaks thus: <em>In no wise shall Thou do this thing, to slay the righteous with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, for then shall the righteous be as the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. In no wise shall Thou, Who judgest the earth, execute this judgment</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330750"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse25">Genesis&nbsp;18:25</a></span> This <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, the righteous Judge, is clearly also the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Blasphemer! Your own <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> confutes you. Not yet do I bring forward the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> concerning God the Judge; the Law has told me that He is the Judge. You must deprive the Son of His judgeship before you can deprive Him of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity. You have solemnly confessed that He Who is the only righteous Judge is also the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; your own statements bind you to the admission that He Who is the righteous Judge is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. This Judge is the Lord, to Whom all things are possible, the Promiser of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessings, Judge of righteous and of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. He is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, worshipped by him. Fool and blasphemer that you are, your shameless readiness of tongue must invent some new fallacy, if you are to prove that He is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</p>

<p>17. His merciful and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> self-revelations are in no wise inconsistent with His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heavenly nature; and His faithful <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> never fail to penetrate the guise He has assumed in order that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may see Him. The types of the Law foreshew the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; they enable the Patriarch to see and to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what hereafter the Apostle is to gaze on and publish. For, since the Law is the shadow of things to come, the shadow that was seen was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> outline of the reality which cast it. God was seen and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and worshipped as Man, Who was indeed to be born as Man in the fullness of time. He takes upon Him, to meet the Patriarch's eye, a semblance which foreshadows the future <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In that old day God was only seen, not born, as Man; in due time He was born, as well as seen. Familiarity with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> appearance, which He took that men might behold Him, was to prepare them for the time when He should, in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, be born as Man. Then it was that the shadow took substance, the semblance reality, the vision life. But God remained unchanged, whether He were seen in the appearance, or born in the reality, of manhood. The resemblance was perfect between Himself, after His birth, and Himself, as He had been seen in vision. As He was born, so He had appeared; as He had appeared, so was He born. But, since the time has not yet come for us to compare the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> account with that of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, let us pursue our chosen course through the pages of the Law. Hereafter we shall prove from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> that it was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Who was born as Man; for the present, we are showing from the Law that it was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Who appeared to the Patriarchs in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>. For when One appeared to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> as Man, He was worshipped as God and proclaimed as Judge; and when the Lord rained from the Lord, beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the Law tells us that the Lord rained from the Lord in order to reveal to us the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Nor can we for a moment suppose that when the Patriarch, with full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, worshipped the Son as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he was blind to the fact that it was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God Whom he worshipped.</p>

<p>18. But godless unbelief finds it very hard to apprehend the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Their capacity for devotion has never been expanded by belief, and is too narrow to receive a full presentment of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Hence the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot grasp the great work done by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in being born as Man to accomplish the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>; in the work of its <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> it fails to see the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They think of the travail of His birth, the feebleness of infancy, the growth of childhood, the attainment of maturity, of bodily suffering and of the Cross with which it ended, and of the death upon the Cross; and all this conceals His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead from their eyes. Yet He had called into being all these capacities for Himself, as additions to His nature; capacities which in His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divine nature He had not possessed. Thus He acquired them without loss of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity, and ceased not to be God when He became Man; when He, Who is God <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, became Man at a point in time. They cannot see an exercise of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God's power in His becoming what He was not before, yet never ceasing to be His former Self. And yet there would have been no acceptance of our feeble nature, had not He by the strength of His own <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> nature, while remaining what He was, come to be what previously He was not. What blindness of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, what foolish wisdom of the world, which cannot see that the reproach of Christ is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the folly of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the wisdom of God! So Christ in your eyes is not God because He, Who was from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, was born, because the Unchangeable grew with years, the Impassible suffered, the Living died, the Dead lives; because all His history contradicts the common course of nature! Is not all this simply to say that He, being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>? Not yet, you <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and venerable <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, do I turn your pages, to prove from them that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, amid these changes and sufferings, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the Law is the forerunner of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, and the Law must teach us that, when God clothed Himself in infirmity, He lost not His Godhead. The types of the Law are our convincing assurance of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>19. Be with me now in your faithful spirit, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed Patriarch Jacob, to combat the poisonous hissings of the serpent of unbelief. Prevail once more in your wrestling with the Man, and, being the stronger, once more entreat His blessing. Why <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for what you might demand from your weaker Opponent? Your strong arm has vanquished Him Whose blessing you pray. Your bodily victory is in broad contrast to your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> humility, your <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> to your thoughts. It is a Man whom you hold powerless in your strong grasp; but in your eye this Man is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God not in name only, but in nature. It is not the blessing of a God by adoption that thou dost claim, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God's blessing. With Man you strive, but face to face you see God. What you see with the bodily eye is different far from what you behold with the vision of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. You have felt Him to be weak Man; but your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been saved because it saw God in Him. When you were wrestling you were Jacob; you are <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> now, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the blessing which you claimed. According to the flesh, the Man is your inferior, for a type of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> in the flesh; but you can recognise God in that weak flesh, for a sign of His blessing in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the eye does not disturb your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; His feebleness does not mislead you into neglect of His blessing. Though He is Man, His humanity is no bar to His being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, His Godhead no bar to His being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for, being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He must indeed be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. </p>

<p>20. The Law in its progress still follows the sequence of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, of which it is the shadow; its types are a faithful anticipation of the truths taught by the Apostles. In the vision of his dream the blessed Jacob saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; this was the revelation of a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, not a bodily manifestation. For there was shown to him the descent of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by the ladder, and their ascent to heaven, and God resting above the ladder; and the vision, as it was interpreted, foretold that his dream should some day become a revealed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The Patriarch's words, <em>The house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the gate of heaven</em>, show us the scene of His vision; and then, after a long account of what he did, the narrative proceeds thus: <em>And God said unto Jacob, Arise, and go up to the place Bethel, and dwell there: and make there a Sacrifice unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that appeared unto you when you fled from the face of <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330752"><a href="../bible/gen035.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;35:1</a></span> If the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> has access through God the Son to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and if it is only through God that God can be apprehended, then show us in what sense This is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who demands reverence for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who rests above the heavenly ladder. What difference of nature separates the Two, when Both bear the one name which indicates the one nature? It is God Who was seen; it is also God Who speaks about God Who was seen. God cannot be apprehended except through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; even as also God accepts no worship from us except through God. We could not understand that the One must be reverenced, unless the Other had taught us reverence for Him; we could not have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that the One is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless we had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Godhead of the Other. The revelation of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> holds its appointed course; it is by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that we are initiated into the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And when one name, which tells of one nature, combines the Father with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, how can the Son so fall beneath Himself as to be other than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God?</p>

<p>21. Human judgment must not pass its sentence upon God. Our nature is not such that it can lift itself by its own forces to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of heavenly things. We must learn from God what we are to think of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; we have no source of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> but Himself. You may be as carefully trained as you will in secular <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; you may have lived a life of righteousness. All this will contribute to your mental satisfaction, but it will not help you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was adopted as the son of the queen, and instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; he had, moreover, out of loyalty to his race avenged the wrong of the Hebrew by slaying the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> , and yet he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the God Who had blessed his fathers. For when he left <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the discovery of his deed, and was living as a shepherd in the land of Midian, he saw a fire in the bush, and the bush unconsumed. Then it was that he heard the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and asked His name, and learned His nature. Of all this he could have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> nothing except through God Himself. And we, in like manner, must confine ourselves, in whatever we say of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the terms in which He has spoken to our understanding concerning Himself.</p>

<p>22. It is the Angel of God Who appeared in the fire from the bush; and it is God Who spoke from the bush amid the fire. He is manifested as Angel; that is His office, not His nature. The name which expresses His nature is given you as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for the Angel of God is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But perhaps He is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, then, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob, not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God? For the Angel Who speaks from the bush is their God <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>. And, lest you insinuate that the name is His only by adoption, it is the absolute God Who speaks to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. These are His words:&mdash; <em>And the Lord said unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, I Am that I Am; and He said, Thus shall you say unto the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, He that is has sent me unto you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330754"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;3:14</a></span> God's discourse began as the speech of the Angel, in order to reveal the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in the Son. Next He appears as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the name which is His by nature. Finally it is the God that is Who sends <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that we may have full assurance that in the absolute sense He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>23. What further fictions can the futile folly of insane <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> devise? Do you still persist in your nightly sowing of tares, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> to be burnt, among the pure wheat, when the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all the Patriarchs contradicts you? Nay more: if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; unless perchance you deny that it was of Him that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> spoke. If you propose to deny that, you must listen to the words of God:&mdash; <em>For had ye <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you would have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Me also, for he wrote of Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330755"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse46">John&nbsp;5:46</a></span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, indeed, will refute you with the whole volume of the Law, ordained through <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, which he received by the hand of the Mediator. Enquire whether He, Who gave the Law, were not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for the Mediator was the Giver. And was it not to meet God that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> led out the people to the Mount? Was it not God Who came down into the Mount? Or was it, perhaps, only by a fiction or an adoption, and not by right of nature, that He, Who did all this, bore the name of God? Mark the blare of the trumpets, the flashing of the torches, the clouds of smoke, as from a furnace, rolling over the mountain, the terror of conscious impotence on the part of man in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the confession of the people, when they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to be their spokesman, that at the voice of God they would die. Is He, in your judgment, not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when simple dread lest He should speak filled <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death? He Whose voice could not be borne by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness? In your eyes is He not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He addressed you through the weak faculties of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that you might hear, and live ? <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> entered the Mount; in forty days and nights he gained the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of heaven, and set it all in order according to the vision of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which was revealed to him there. From intercourse with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who spoke with him, he received the reflected splendour of that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on which none may gaze? His corruptible countenance was transfigured into the likeness of the unapproachable light of Him, with Whom he was dwelling. Of this God he bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, of this God he speaks; he summons the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God to come and worship Him amid the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that the blessings which please Him may descend upon the head of Joseph. In face of such evidence as this, dare any man say that He has nothing but the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and deny His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divinity?</p>

<p>24. This long discussion has, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, brought out the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that no sound argument has ever been adduced in favour of a distinction between One Who is, and One Who is not, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in those passages where the Law speaks of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of Lord and Lord. I have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that these terms are inconsistent with difference between Them in name or in nature, and that we can use the name as a test of the nature, and the nature as a clue to the name. Thus I have shown that the character, the power, the attributes, the name of God are inherent in Him Whom the Law has called God. I have shown also that the Law, gradually unfolding the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, reveals the Son as a Person by manifesting God as <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>, in the creation of the world, to the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the formation of man making what is the joint image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and again, that in the judgment of the men of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> the Lord is Judge from the Lord; that, in the giving of blessings and ordaining of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the Law, the Angel of God is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus, in support of the saving confession of God as ever manifested in the Persons of Father and of Son, we have shown how the Law teaches the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead by the use of the strict name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for, while the Law states clearly that They are Two, it casts no shadow of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead of either.</p>

<p>25. And now the time has come for us to put a stop to that cunning artifice of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, by which they pervert the devout and godly teachings of the Law into a support for their own godless delusion. They preface their denial of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with the words, <em>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord your God is One; </em>and then, because their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> would be refuted by the identity of name, since the Law speaks of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they invoke the authority of the prophetic words, <em>They shall bless You, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em>, to prove that the name is not used in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense. They argue that these words teach that God is One, and that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, has His name only and not His nature; and that therefore we must conclude that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God is one Person only. But perhaps you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, fool, that we shall contradict these texts of yours, and so deny that there is one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Assuredly we do not contradict them by a confession conceived in your sense. Our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> receives them, our reason accepts them, our words declare them. We recognise One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. The name of God has no dangers for our confession, which proclaims that in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Son there is the One <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Learn the meaning of your own words, recognise the One <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and then you will be able to make a faithful confession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, One and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. It is the words of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which you are turning into the instrument of your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, preserving the sound and perverting the sense. Masquerading in a foolish garb of imaginary wisdom, under cover of loyalty to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> you are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth's</a> destroyer. You confess that God is One and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, on purpose to deny the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which you confess. Your language claims a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> on the strength of its impiety, for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> on the strength of its <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. Your preaching of One <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God leads up to a denial of Him. For you deny that the Son is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though you admit that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but God in name only, not in nature. If His birth be in name, not in nature, then you are justified in denying His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> right to the name; but if He be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how then can He fail to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God by virtue of His birth? Deny the fact, and you may deny the consequence; if you admit the fact, how can He be other than Himself? No being can alter its own essential nature. About His birth I shall speak presently; meantime I will refute your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> falsehoods concerning His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Divine nature by the utterances of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. But I shall take care that in our assertion of the One <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God I give no cover to the Sabellian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> that the Father is one Person with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and none to that <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> against the Son's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead, which you evolve out of the unity of the One <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</p>

<p>26. Blasphemy is incompatible with wisdom; where the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the beginning of wisdom, is absent, no glimmer of intelligence survives. An instance of this is seen in the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics'</a> citation of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> words, <em>And they shall bless You, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em>, as evidence against the Godhead of the Son. First, we see here the folly, which clogs unbelief in the misunderstanding or (if it were understood) in the suppression of the earlier part of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>: and again we see it in their fraudulent interpolation of that one little word, not to be found in the book itself. This proceeding is as stupid as it is dishonest, since no one would trust them so far as to accept their reading without referring for corroboration to the prophetic text. For that text does not stand thus: <em>They shall bless You, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em>, but thus: <em>They shall bless the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330757"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;65:16</a></span> There is no slight difference between <em>You, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God </em>and <em>The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em>. If <em>You </em>be retained, the pronoun of the second person implies that Another is being addressed; if <em>You </em>be omitted, <em>True God</em>, the object of the sentence, is the Speaker.</p>

<p>27. To ensure that our explanation of the passage shall be complete and certain, I cite the words in full:&mdash; <em>Therefore thus says the Lord, Behold, they that serve Me shall eat, but you shall be hungry, behold, they that serve Me shall drink, but you shall be thirsty, behold, they that serve Me shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, but you shall cry for sorrow of your heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit. For you shall leave your name for a rejoicing unto My chosen, but the Lord shall slay you. But My servants shall be called by a new name, which shall be blessed upon earth; and they shall bless the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and they that <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> upon the earth shall <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em>.  There is always a good reason for any departure from the accustomed modes of expression, but novelty is also made an opportunity for misinterpretation. The question here is, Why, when so many earlier prophecies have been uttered concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the name <em>God</em>, alone and without epithet, has sufficed hitherto to indicate the Divine majesty and nature, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> should now foretell through Isaiah that the <em><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> </em>God was to be blessed, and that men should <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> upon earth by the <em><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> </em>God. First, we must bear in mind that this discourse was spoken concerning times to come. Now, I ask, was not He, in the mind of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whom men used then to bless, and by whom they swore? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, unaware of the typical meaning of their <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and therefore <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, worshipped God simply as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not as Father ; for, if they had worshipped Him as Father, they would have worshipped the Son also. It was <em>God</em>, therefore, Whom they blessed and by Whom they swore. But the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> testifies that it is <em><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> </em>God Who shall be blessed hereafter; calling Him <em><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em>, because the mysteriousness of His Incarnation was to blind the eyes of some to His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead. When <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> was to be published abroad, it was necessary that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should be clearly stated. And now let us review this passage, clause by clause.</p>

<p>28. <em>Therefore thus says the Lord, Behold, they that serve Me shall eat, but you shall be hungry; behold, they that serve Me shall drink, but you shall be thirsty</em>. Note that one clause contains two different tenses, in order to teach <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> concerning two different times; <em>They that serve Me shall eat</em>. Present <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is rewarded with a future prize, and similarly present godlessness shall suffer the penalty of future thirst and hunger. Then He adds, <em>Behold, they that serve Me shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, but you shall cry for sorrow of your heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit</em>. Here again, as before, there is a revelation for the future and for the present. They who serve now shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, while they who do not serve shall abide in crying and howling through sorrow of heart and vexation of spirit. He proceeds, <em>For you shall leave your name for a rejoicing unto My chosen, but the Lord shall slay you</em>. These words, dealing with a future time, are addressed to the carnal <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, which is taunted with the prospect of having to surrender its name to the chosen of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What is this name? <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, of course; for to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> was addressed. And now I ask, What is <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> today? The Apostle gives the answer:&mdash; They who are in the spirit, not in the letter, they who walk in the Law of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> of God <span class="stiki" id="note330760"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;2:29</a></span> .</p>

<p>29. Furthermore, we must form a conclusion why it is that the words cited above, <em>Therefore thus says the Lord</em>, are followed by <em>But the Lord shall slay you</em>, and as to the meaning of the next sentence, <em>But my servants shall be called by a new name, which shall be blessed upon earth</em>. There can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that both <em>Therefore thus says the </em> <em>Lord</em>, and afterwards <em>But the Lord shall slay you, </em>prove that it was the Lord Who both spoke, and also purposed to slay, Who meant to reward His servants with that new name, Who was well known to have spoken through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and was to be the judge of the righteous and of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. And thus the remainder of this revelation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> removes all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning the Lord as Speaker and as Slayer. It continues:&mdash; <em>But My servants shall be called by a new name, which shall be blessed upon earth</em>. Here everything is in the future. What then is this new name of a religion; a name which shall be blessed upon earth? If ever in past ages there were a blessing upon the name <em><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a></em>, it is not a new name. But if this hallowed name of our devotion towards God be new, then this new title of <em><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a></em>, awarded to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is that heavenly blessing which is our reward upon earth.</p>

<p>30. And now come words in perfect harmony with the inward assurance of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He says, <em>And they shall bless the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and they that <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> upon earth shall <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em>. And indeed they who in God's service have received the new name shall bless <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and moreover the God by Whom they shall <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. What <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is there as to Who this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God is, by Whom men shall <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> and Whom they shall bless, through Whom a new and blessed name shall be given to them that serve Him? I have on my side, in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> misrepresentations of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, the clear and definite evidence of the Church's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the new name which Thou, O Christ, hast given, of the blessed title which You have bestowed in reward of loyal service. It swears that You are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Every mouth, O Christ, of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> tells that You are God. The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of all <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> swears that You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, confesses, proclaims, is inwardly assured, that You are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</p>

<p>31. And thus this passage of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, taken with its whole context, clearly describes as God both Him Whom we serve for the new name's sake, and Him through Whom the new name is blessed upon earth. It tells us Who it is that is blessed as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Who is <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> by as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. And this is the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> made, in the fullness of time, by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in loyal devotion to Christ her Lord. We can see how exactly the words of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> conform to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, by their refraining from the insertion of that pronoun of the second person. Had the words been <em>You, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God</em>, then they might have been interpreted as spoken to another. <em>The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God </em>can refer to none but the Speaker. The passage, taken by itself, shows to Whom it refers; the preceding words, taken in connection with it, declare Who the Speaker is Who makes this confession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They are these:&mdash; <em>I have appeared openly to them that asked not for Me, and, I have been found of them that sought Me not. I said, Here am I, unto a nation that called not on My name. I have spread out My hands all the day to an unbelieving and gainsaying people</em>.  Could a dishonest attempt to suppress the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be more completely exposed, or the Speaker be more distinctly revealed as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, than here? Who, I demand, was it that appeared to them that asked not for Him, and was found of them that sought Him not? What nation is it that formerly called not on His name? Who is it that spread out His hands all the day to an unbelieving and gainsaying people? Compare with these words that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and Divine Song of Deuteronomy <span class="stiki" id="note330762"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse21">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:21</a></span>, in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> against them that are no Gods, moves the unbelievers to jealousy against those that are no people and a foolish nation. Conclude for yourself, Who it is that makes Himself manifest to them that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not; Who, though one people is His own, becomes the possession of strangers; Who it is that spreads out His hands before an unbelieving and gainsaying people, nailing to the cross the writing of the former sentence against us. <span class="stiki" id="note330763"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse14">Colossians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> For the same Spirit in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, whom we are considering, proceeds thus in the course of this one <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, which is connected in argument as well as continuous in utterance:&mdash; <em>But My servants shall be called by a new name, which shall be blessed upon earth, and they shall bless the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and they that <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> upon the earth shall <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</em></p>

<p>32. If <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, in its folly and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, shall attempt to entice the simple-minded and uninstructed away from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> belief that these words were spoken in reference to God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, by feigning that they are an utterance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father concerning Himself, it shall hear sentence passed upon the lie by the Apostle and Teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. He interprets all these prophecies as allusions to the passion of the Lord and to the times of <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when he is reproving the unbelief of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, which will not recognise that the Lord has come in the flesh. His words are:&mdash; <em>For whosoever shall have called upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How shall they call on Him in Whom they have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>? But how shall they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> </em> <em>in Him of Whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, excerpt they have been sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that proclaim peace, of them that proclaim <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. But all do not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For Esaias says, Lord, who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> our report? So then <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> comes by hearing and hearing through the word. But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. But I say, Did not <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>? First <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says, I will provoke you to jealousy against them that are no people, and against a foolish nation I will <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> you. Moreover Esaias is bold, and says, I appeared unto them that seek Me not, I was found by them that asked not after Me. But to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> what says He? All day long I have stretched forth My hands to a people that hearken not</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330764"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;10:13-21</a></span> Who are you that hast mounted up through the successive heavens, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> not whether thou were in the body or out of the body, and canst explain more faithfully than he the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>? Who are you that hast heard, and may not tell, the ineffable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the secret things of heaven, and hast proclaimed with greater assurance the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> granted you by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for revelation? Who are you that hast been fore-ordained to a full share of the Lord's suffering on the Cross, and first has been caught up to Paradise and drawn nobler teaching from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of God than this chosen vessel? If there be such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, has he been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that these are the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and words of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, proclaimed to us by His own <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and chosen Apostle that we may recognise in Him their Author?</p>

<p>33. But it may be argued that the Apostle was not inspired by the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> when he borrowed these prophetic words; that he was only interpreting at random the words of another man, and though, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, everything the Apostle says of himself comes to him by revelation from Christ, yet his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the words of Isaiah is only derived from the book. I answer that in the beginning of that utterance in which it is said that the servants of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God shall bless Him and <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by Him, we read this adoration by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>:&mdash; <em>From everlasting we have not heard, nor have our eyes seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except You, and Your works which You will do for them that await Your mercy</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330765"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;64:4</a></span> Isaiah says that he has seen no God but Him. For he did actually see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Whose taking flesh from the Virgin he foretold. And if you, in your <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it was God the Only-begotten Whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> saw in that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, listen to the Evangelist:&mdash; <em>These things said Esaias, when he saw His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and spoke of Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330766"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse41">John&nbsp;12:41</a></span> The Apostle, the Evangelist, the Prophet combine to silence your objections. Isaiah did see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; even though it is written, <em>No one has seen God at any time, save the Only-begotten Son Who is in the bosom of the Father; He has declared Him</em> , it was God Whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> saw. He gazed upon the Divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and men were filled with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> at such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> vouchsafed to his prophetic greatness. For this was the reason why the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> passed sentence of death upon him.</p>

<p>34. Thus the Only-begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, has told us of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whom no man has seen. Either disprove the fact that the Son has thus informed us, or else <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him Who has been seen, Who appeared to them who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not, and became the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who called not upon Him and spread out His hands before a gainsaying people. And <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this also concerning Him, that they who serve Him are called by a new name, and that on earth men bless Him and <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by Him as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Prophecy tells, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> confirms, the Apostle explains, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> confesses, that He Who was seen is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but none venture to say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father was seen. And yet the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> has run to such lengths that, while they profess to recognise this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they really deny it. They deny it by means of the newfangled and godless device of evading the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, while making a studied pretence of adhesion to it. For when they confess one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, alone <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and alone righteous, alone wise, alone unchangeable, alone <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, alone mighty, they attach to Him a Son different in substance, not born from God to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but adopted through creation to be a Son, having the name of God not by nature, but as a title received by adoption; and thus they inevitably deprive the Son of all those attributes which they accumulate upon the Father in His lonely majesty.</p>

<p>35. The distorted mind of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is incapable of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> and confessing the One <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and reason necessary for such confession is incompatible with unbelief. We must confess Father and Son before we can apprehend God as One and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. When we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, accomplished in us through the power of regeneration unto life in the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, then we may hope to penetrate the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the Law and the Prophets. Godless <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the teaching of Evangelists and Apostles cannot frame the thought of One <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Out of the teaching of Evangelists and Apostles we shall present the sound doctrine concerning Him, in accurate agreement with the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. We shall present Him in such wise that the Only-begotten, Who is of the substance of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, shall be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as indivisible and inseparable in nature, not in Person. We shall set forth God as One, because God is from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But we shall also establish this doctrine of the perfect unity of God upon the words of the Prophets, and make them the foundations of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> structure, proving that there is One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with one Divine nature, by the fact that God the Only-begotten is never classed apart as a second God. For throughout this book of our treatise we have followed the same course as in its predecessor; the same methods which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> there that the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> here that He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. I trust that our explanation of each passage has been so convincing that we have now manifested Him as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God as effectually as we formerly demonstrated His Godhead. The remainder of the book shall be devoted to the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that He, Who is now recognised as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must not be regarded as a second God. Our disproof of the notion of a second God will further establish the unity; and this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall be displayed as not inconsistent with the personal <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, while yet it maintains the unity of nature in God and God.</p>

<p>36. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> method of our enquiry demands that we should begin with him, through whom God first manifested Himself to the world, that is, with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, by whose mouth God the Only-begotten thus declared Himself; <em>See, see that I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there is no God beside Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note330768"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse39">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:39</a></span> That godless <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> must not assign these words to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the unbegotten Father, is clear by the sense of the passage and by the evidence of the Apostle who, as we have already stated , has taught us to understand this whole discourse as spoken by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Only-begotten. The Apostle also points out the words, <em>Rejoice, O you nations, with His people</em>  as those of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and in corroboration further cites this:&mdash; <em>And there shall be a root of Jesse, and One that shall arise to rule the nations; in Him shall the nations trust</em>.  Thus <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by the words, <em>Rejoice, O you nations, with His people</em> indicates Him Who said, <em>There is no God beside Me; </em>and the Apostle refers the same words to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, God the Only-begotten, in Whose rising as a king from the root of Jesse, according to the flesh, the hope of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> rests. And therefore we must now consider the meaning of these words, that we, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they were spoken by Him, may ascertain in what sense He spoke them.</p>

<p>37. That <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and absolute and perfect doctrine, which forms our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is the confession of God from God and God in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by no bodily process but by Divine power, by no transfusion from nature into nature but through the secret and mighty working of the One nature; God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not by division or extension or emanation, but by the operation of a nature which brings into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, by means of birth, a nature One with itself. The facts shall receive a fuller treatment in the next book, which is to be devoted to an exposition of the teaching of the Evangelists and Apostles; for the present we must maintain our assertion and belief by means of the Law and the Prophets. The nature with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is born is necessarily the same as that of His Source. He cannot come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> as other than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since His origin is from none other than God. His nature is the same, not in the sense that the Begetter also was begotten&mdash; for then the Unbegotten, having been begotten, would not be Himself&mdash; but that the substance of the Begotten consists in all those elements which are summed up in the substance of the Begetter, Who is His only Origin. Thus it is due to no external <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that His origin is from the One, and that His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> partakes the Unity; there is no novel element in Him, because His life is from the Living; no element absent, because the Living begot Him to partake His own life. Hence, in the generation of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the incorporeal and unchangeable God begets, in accordance with His own nature, God incorporeal and unchangeable; and this perfect birth of incorporeal and unchangeable God from incorporeal and unchangeable God involves, as we see in the light of the revelation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, no diminution of the Begetter's substance. And so God the Only-begotten bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> through the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; <em>See, see that I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there is no God beside Me</em>. For there is no second Divine nature, and so there can be no God beside Him, since He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet by the powers of His nature God is also in Him. And because He is God and God is in Him, there is no God beside Him; for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, than Whom there is no other Source of Deity, is in Him, and consequently there is within Him not only His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but the Author of that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.</p>

<p>38. This saving <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which we profess is sustained by the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, speaking with one voice through many mouths, and never, through long and changing ages, bearing an uncertain <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the truths of revelation. For instance, the words which, as we are told through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, were spoken by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Only-begotten, are confirmed for our better instruction by the prophetic spirit, speaking this time through those men of stature&mdash; <em>For God is in You, and there is no God beside You. You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not, O God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Saviour</em>. Let <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> fling itself with its utmost effort of despair and rage against this declaration of a name and nature inseparably joined, and rend in two, if its <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> struggles can, a union perfect in title and in fact. God is in God and beside Him there is no God. Let <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, if it can, divide the God within from the God within Whom He is, and classify, Each after His kind, the members of that mystic union. For when He says <em>God is in You</em>, He teaches that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is present in God the Son; for we must understand that it is the God <em>Who is</em> <span class="stiki" id="note330772"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;3:14</a></span> that is in Him. And when He adds, <em>And there is no God beside You</em>, He shows that outside Him there is no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since God's dwelling is within Himself. And the third assertion, <em>You are God and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not</em>, sets forth for our instruction what must be the confession of the devout and believing <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. When it has learned the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the Divine birth, and the name <em><a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a> </em>which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> announced to Joseph, it must cry, <em>You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not, O God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Saviour</em>. It must recognise the subsistence of the Divine nature in Him, inasmuch as God is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the nonexistence of any other God except the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For, He being God and God being in Him, the delusion of another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of what kind soever, must be surrendered. Such is the message of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah; he bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the indivisible and inseparable Godhead of Father and of Son.</p>

<p>39. Jeremiah also, a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> equally inspired, has taught that God the Only-begotten is of a nature one with that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. His words are:&mdash; <em>This is our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there shall be none other likened unto Him, Who has found out all the way of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and has given it unto Jacob His servant, and to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> His beloved. Afterward He was seen upon earth, and dwelt among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a></em>.  Why try to transform the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> into a second God? Learn to recognise and to confess the One True God. No second God is likened to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and so can claim to be God. He is God from God by nature and by birth, for the Source of His Godhead is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And, again, He is not a second <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for no other is likened unto Him; the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that is in Him is nothing else than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Why link together, in pretended devotion to the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and false, base and genuine, unlike and unlike? The Father is God and the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. God is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; beside Him there is no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and none other is likened unto Him so as to be God. If in these Two you shall recognise the Unity, instead of the solitude, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you will share the Church's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which confesses the Father in the Son. But if, in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, you insist that God is One in order to enforce the doctrine of His isolation, then you are a stranger to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for you deny that God is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>
