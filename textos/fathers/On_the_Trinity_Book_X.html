<h1>On the Trinity (Book X)</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">In which there is shown to be another trinity in the mind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and one that appears much more evidently, viz. in his memory, understanding, and will.</span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; The Love of the Studious Mind, that Is, of One Desirous to Know, is Not the Love of a Thing Which It Does Not Know.</h2>

<p>1. Let us now proceed, then, in due order, with a more exact purpose, to explain this same point more thoroughly. And first, since no one can <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> at all a thing of which he is wholly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, we must carefully consider of what sort is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of those who are studious, that is, of those who do not already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but are still desiring to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> any branch of learning. Now certainly, in those things whereof the word study is not commonly used, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> often arises from hearsay, when the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of anything for beauty inflames the mind to the seeing and enjoying it; since the mind <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> generically wherein consist the beauties of corporeal things, from having seen them very frequently, and since there exists within a faculty of approving that which outwardly is longed for. And when this happens, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that is called forth is not of a thing wholly unknown, since its genus is thus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. But when we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man whose face we never saw, we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> [abstractly] in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself. But in the case of learning, it is for the most part the authority of others who praise and commend it that kindles our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of it; although nevertheless we could not burn with any <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> at all for the study of it, unless we had already in our mind at least a slight impression of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of each kind of learning. For who, for instance, would devote any care and labor to the learning of rhetoric, unless he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> before that it was the science of speaking? Sometimes, again, we marvel at the results of learning itself, which we have heard of or experienced; and hence burn to obtain, by learning, the power of attaining these results. Just as if it were said to one who did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his letters, that there is a kind of learning which enables a man to send words, wrought with the hand in silence, to one who is ever so far absent, for him in turn to whom they are sent to gather these words, not with his ears, but with his eyes; and if the man were to see the thing actually done, is not that man, since he desires to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how he can do this thing, altogether moved to study with a view to the result which he already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and holds? So it is that the studious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of those who learn is kindled: for that of which any one is utterly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, he can in no way <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p>2. So also, if any one hear an unknown sign, as, for instance, the sound of some word of which he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the signification, he desires to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what it is; that is, he desires to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what thing it is which it is agreed shall be brought to mind by that sound: as if he heard the word <em> temetum</em>  uttered, and not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, should ask what it is. He must then <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> already that it is a sign, <em>i.e.</em> that the word is not an empty sound, but that something is signified by it; for in other respects this trisyllabic word is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him already, and has already impressed its articulate form upon his mind through the sense of hearing. And then what more is to be required in him, that he may go on to a greater <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that of which all the letters and all the spaces of its several sounds are already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, unless that it shall at the same time have become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him that it is a sign, and shall have also moved him with the desire of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> of what it is the sign? The more, then, the thing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, yet not fully <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, the more the mind desires to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> concerning it what remains to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it to be only such and such a spoken word, and did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it was the sign of something, he would seek nothing further, since the sensible thing is already perceived as far as it can be by the sense. But because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it to be not only a spoken word, but also a sign, he wishes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it perfectly; and no sign is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> perfectly, except it be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of what it is the sign. He then who with ardent carefulness seeks to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, and inflamed by studious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> perseveres in the search; can such an one be said to be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? What then does he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? For certainly nothing can be loved unless it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For that man does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those three syllables which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> already. But if he loves this in them, that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them to signify something, this is not the point now in question, for it is not this which he seeks to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. But we are now asking what it is he loves, in that which he is desirous to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but which certainly he does not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; and we are therefore wondering why he loves, since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> most assuredly that nothing can be loved unless it be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. What then does he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, except that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and perceives in the reason of things what excellence there is in learning, in which the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all signs is contained; and what benefit there is in the being skilled in these, since by them <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fellowship mutually communicates its own perceptions, lest the assemblies of men should be actually worse than utter solitude, if they were not to mingle their thoughts by conversing together? The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, then, discerns this fitting and serviceable species, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it, and loves it; and he who seeks the meaning of any words of which he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, studies to render that species perfect in himself as much as he can: for it is one thing to behold it in the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, another to desire it as within his own capacity. For he beholds in the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> how great and how good a thing it is to understand and to speak all tongues of all nations, and so to hear no tongue and to be heard by none as from a foreigner. The beauty, then, of this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is already discerned by thought, and the thing being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> is loved; and that thing is so regarded, and so stimulates the studious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of learners, that they are moved with respect to it, and desire it eagerly in all the labor which they spend upon the attainment of such a capacity, in order that they may also embrace in practice that which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> beforehand by reason. And so every one, the nearer he approaches that capacity in hope, the more fervently desires it with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; for those branches of learning are studied the more eagerly, which men do not despair of being able to attain; for when any one entertains no hope of attaining his end, then he either loves lukewarmly or does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> at all, howsoever he may see the excellence of it. Accordingly, because the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all languages is almost universally felt to be hopeless, every one studies most to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that of his own nation; but if he feels that he is not sufficient even to comprehend this perfectly, yet no one is so indolent in this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as not to wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, when he hears an unknown word, what it is, and to seek and learn it if he can. And while he is seeking it, certainly he has a studious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of learning, and seems to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a thing he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; but the case is really otherwise. For that species touches the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which the mind <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and thinks, wherein the fitness is clearly visible which accrues from the associating of minds with one another, in the hearing and returning of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and spoken words. And this species kindles studious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in him who seeks what indeed he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not, but gazes upon and loves the unknown form to which that pertains. If then, for example, any one were to ask, What is <em> temetum</em> (for I had instanced this word already), and it were said to him, What does this matter to you? He will answer, Lest perhaps I hear some one speaking, and understand him not; or perhaps read the word somewhere, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what the writer meant. Who, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, would say to such an inquirer, Do not care about understanding what you hear; do not care about <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what you read? For almost every rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> quickly discerns the beauty of that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, through which the thoughts of men are mutually made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the enunciation of significant words; and it is on account of this fitness thus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and because <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> therefore loved, that such an unknown word is studiously sought out. When then he hears and learns that wine was called <q> <em>temetum</em></q> by our forefathers, but that the word is already quite obsolete in our present usage of language, he will think perhaps that he has still need of the word on account of this or that book of those forefathers. But if he holds these also to be superfluous, perhaps he does now come to think the word not worth remembering, since he sees it has nothing to do with that species of learning which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and gazes upon, and so loves.</p>

<p>3. Wherefore in all cases the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of a studious <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that is, of one that wishes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, is not the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of that thing which it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but of that which it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; on account of which it wishes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Or if it is so inquisitive as to be carried away, not for any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to it, but by the mere <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> things unknown; then such an inquisitive person is, doubtless distinguishable from an ordinary student, yet does not, any more than he, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> things he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; nay, on the contrary, he is more fitly said to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> things he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not, of which he wishes that there should be none, in wishing to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> everything. But lest any one should lay before us a more difficult question, by declaring that it is just as impossible for any one to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> what he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, as to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, we will not withstand what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but it must be understood that it is not the same thing to say he loves to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things unknown, as to say he loves things unknown. For it is possible that a man may <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things unknown; but it is not possible that he should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> things unknown. For the word to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is not placed there without meaning; since he who loves to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things unknown, does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the unknown things themselves, but the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> of them. And unless he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> means, no one could say confidently, either that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> or that he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. For not only he who says I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and says so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, must needs <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> is; but he also who says, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and says so confidently and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he says so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> is; for he both distinguishes him who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from him who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, when he looks into himself and says <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; and whereas he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he says this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, whence should he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, if he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> is?</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; No One at All Loves Things Unknown.</h2>

<p>4. No studious person, then, no inquisitive person, loves things he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, even while he is urgent with the most vehement desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. For he either <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> already generically what he loves, and longs to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it also in some individual or individuals, which perhaps are praised, but not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him; and he pictures in his mind an imaginary form by which he may be stirred to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And whence does he picture this, except from those things which he has already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>? And yet perhaps he will not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it, if he find that form which was praised to be unlike that other form which was figured and in thought most fully <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. And if he has loved it, he will begin to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it from that time when he learned it; since a little before, that form which was loved was other than that which the mind that formed it had been wont to exhibit to itself. But if he shall find it similar to that form which report had proclaimed, and to be such that he could <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> say I was already loving you; yet certainly not even then did he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a form he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, since he had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it in that likeness. Or else we see somewhat in the species of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reason, and therein <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it; and when this is manifested in some image of a temporal thing, and we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the praises of those who have made trial of it, and so <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it, then we do not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> anything unknown, according to that which we have already sufficiently discussed above. Or else, again, we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> something <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and on account of it seek something unknown; and so it is by no means the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the thing unknown that possesses us, but the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the thing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, to which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the unknown thing belongs, so that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that too which we seek still as unknown; as a little before I said of an unknown word. Or else, again, every one loves the very <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> itself, as no one can fail to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who desires to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> anything. For these reasons they seem to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> things unknown who wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> anything which they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and who, on account of their vehement desire of inquiry, cannot be said to be without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. But how different the case really is, and that nothing at all can be loved which is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, I think I must have persuaded every one who carefully looks upon <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But since the examples which we have given belong to those who desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> something which they themselves are not, we must take thought lest perchance some new notion appear, when the mind desires to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; That When the Mind Loves Itself, It is Not Unknown to Itself.</h2>

<p>5. What, then, does the mind <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, when it seeks ardently to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself, while it is still unknown to itself? For, behold, the mind seeks to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself, and is excited thereto by studious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. It loves, therefore; but what does it <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Is it itself? But how can this be when it does not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself, and no one can <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>? Is it that report has declared to it its own species, in like way as we commonly hear of people who are absent? Perhaps, then, it does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself, but loves that which it imagines of itself, which is perhaps widely different from what itself is: or if the phantasy in the mind is like the mind itself, and so when it loves this fancied image, it loves itself before it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> itself, because it gazes upon that which is like itself; then it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> other minds from which to picture itself, and so is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to itself generically. Why, then, when it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> other minds, does it not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself, since nothing can possibly be more present to it than itself? But if, as other eyes are more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the eyes of the body, than those eyes are to themselves; then let it not seek itself, because it never will find itself. For eyes can never see themselves except in looking-glasses; and it cannot be supposed in any way that anything of that kind can be applied also to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of incorporeal things, so that the mind should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself, as it were, in a looking-glass. Or does it see in the reason of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> how beautiful it is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> one's self, and so loves this which it sees, and studies to bring it to pass in itself? Because, although it is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to itself, yet it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to it how good it is, that it should be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to itself. And this, indeed, is very wonderful, that it does not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself, and yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> already how excellent a thing it is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself. Or does it see some most excellent end, <em>viz</em>. its own serenity and blessedness, by some hidden remembrance, which has not abandoned it, although it has gone far onwards, and believes that it cannot attain to that same end unless it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself? And so while it loves that, it seeks this; and loves that which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, on account of which it seeks that which is unknown. But why should the remembrance of its own blessedness be able to last, and the remembrance of itself not be able to last as well; that so it should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself which wishes to attain, as well as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that to which it wishes to attain? Or when it loves to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself, does it <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, not itself, which it does not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but the very act of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>; and feel the more annoyed that itself is wanting to its own <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> wherewith it wishes to embrace all things? And it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what it is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; and while it loves this, which it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, desires also to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself. Whereby, then, does it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its own <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, if it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself? For it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> other things, but that it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself; for it is from hence that it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also what <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> is. In what way, then, does that which does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> anything? For it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that some other mind <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, but that itself does so. Therefore it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself. Further, when it seeks to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself now as seeking. Therefore again it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself. And hence it cannot altogether not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself, when certainly it does so far <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself as that it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself as not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> itself. But if it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself, then it does not seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself. And therefore, in the very fact that it seeks itself, it is clearly convicted of being more <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to itself than unknown. For it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself as seeking and as not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> itself, in that it seeks to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; How the Mind Knows Itself, Not in Part, But as a Whole.</h2>

<p>6. What then shall we say? Does that which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself in part, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself in part? But it is absurd to say, that it does not as a whole <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. I do not say, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> wholly; but what it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, it as a whole <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. When therefore it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> anything about itself, which it can only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> as a whole, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself as a whole. But it does <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that itself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> something, while yet except as a whole it cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> anything. Therefore it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself as a whole. Further, what in it is so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to itself, as that it lives? And it cannot at once be a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and not live, while it has also something over and above, <em> viz</em>., that it understands: for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of beasts also live, but do not understand. As therefore a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is a whole <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so it lives as a whole. But it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it lives. Therefore it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself as a whole. Lastly, when the mind seeks to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself, it already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it is a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>: otherwise it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not whether it seeks itself, and perhaps seeks one thing while intending to seek another. For it might happen that itself was not a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and so, in seeking to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that it did not seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself. Wherefore since the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, when it seeks to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what mind is, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it seeks itself, certainly it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that itself is a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Furthermore, if it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> this in itself, that it is a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and a whole <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, then it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself as a whole. But suppose it did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself to be a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but in seeking itself only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it sought itself. For so, too, it may possibly seek one thing for another, if it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this: but that it may not seek one thing for another, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what it seeks. But if it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what it seeks, and seeks itself, then certainly it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself. What therefore more does it seek? But if it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself in part, but still seeks itself in part, then it seeks not itself, but part of itself. For when we speak of the mind itself, we speak of it as a whole. Further, because it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it is not yet found by itself as a whole, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how much the whole is. And so it seeks that which is wanting, as we are wont to seek to recall to the mind something that has slipped from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but has not altogether gone away from it; since we can recognize it, when it has come back, to be the same thing that we were seeking. But how can mind come into <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as though it were possible for the mind not to be in the mind? Add to this, that if, having found a part, it does not seek itself as a whole, yet it as a whole seeks itself. Therefore as a whole it is present to itself, and there is nothing left to be sought: for that is wanting which is sought, not the mind which seeks. Since therefore it as a whole seeks itself, nothing of it is wanting. Or if it does not as a whole seek itself, but the part which has been found seeks the part which has not yet been found then the mind does not seek itself, of which no part seeks itself. For the part which has been found, does not seek itself; nor yet does the part itself which has not yet been found, seek itself; since it is sought by that part which has been already found. Wherefore, since neither the mind as a whole seeks itself, nor does any part of it seek itself, the mind does not seek itself at all.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; Why the Soul is Enjoined to Know Itself. Whence Come the Errors of the Mind Concerning Its Own Substance.</h2>

<p>7. Why therefore is it enjoined upon it, that it should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself? I suppose, in order that, it may consider itself, and live according to its own nature; that is, seek to be regulated according to its own nature, <em>viz</em>., under Him to whom it ought to be subject, and above those things to which it is to be preferred; under Him by whom it ought to be ruled, above those things which it ought to rule. For it does many things through vicious desire, as though in forgetfulness of itself. For it sees some things intrinsically excellent, in that more excellent nature which is God: and whereas it ought to remain steadfast that it may enjoy them, it is turned away from Him, by wishing to appropriate those things to itself, and not to be like to Him by His gift, but to be what He is by its own, and it begins to move and slip gradually down into less and less, which it thinks to be more and more; for it is neither sufficient for itself, nor is anything at all sufficient for it, if it withdraw from Him who is alone sufficient: and so through want and distress it becomes too intent upon its own actions and upon the unquiet delights which it obtains through them: and thus, by the desire of acquiring <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from those things that are without, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of which it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and loves, and which it feels can be lost unless held fast with anxious care, it loses its security, and thinks of itself so much the less, in proportion as it feels the more secure that it cannot lose itself. So, whereas it is one thing not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> oneself, and another not to think of oneself (for we do not say of the man that is skilled in much learning, that he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of grammar, when he is only not thinking of it, because he is thinking at the time of the art of medicine)&mdash;whereas, then, I say it is one thing not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> oneself, and another not to think of oneself, such is the strength of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that the mind draws in with itself those things which it has long thought of with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and has grown into them by the close adherence of diligent study, even when it returns in some way to think of itself. And because these things are corporeal which it loved externally through the carnal senses; and because it has become entangled with them by a kind of daily familiarity, and yet cannot carry those corporeal things themselves with itself internally as it were into the region of incorporeal nature; therefore it combines certain images of them, and thrusts them thus made from itself into itself. For it gives to the forming of them somewhat of its own substance, yet preserves the while something by which it may judge freely of the species of those images; and this something is more properly the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that is, the rational understanding, which is preserved that it may judge. For we see that we have those parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which are informed by the likenesses of corporeal things, in common also with beasts.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; The Opinion Which the Mind Has of Itself is Deceitful.</h2>

<p>8. But the mind <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a>, when it so lovingly and intimately connects itself with these images, as even to consider itself to be something of the same kind. For so it is conformed to them to some extent, not by being this, but by thinking it is so: not that it thinks itself to be an image, but outright that very thing itself of which it entertains the image. For there still lives in it the power of distinguishing the corporeal thing which it leaves without, from the image of that corporeal thing which it contains therefrom within itself: except when these images are so projected as if felt without and not thought within, as in the case of people who are asleep, or mad, or in a trance.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; The Opinions of Philosophers Respecting the Substance of the Soul. The Error of Those Who are of Opinion that the Soul is Corporeal, Does Not Arise from Defective Knowledge of the Soul, But from Their Adding There to Something Foreign to It. What is Meant by Finding.</h2>

<p>9. When, therefore, it thinks itself to be something of this kind, it thinks itself to be a corporeal thing; and since it is perfectly conscious of its own superiority, by which it rules the body, it has hence come to pass that the question has been raised what part of the body has the greater power in the body; and the opinion has been held that this is the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, nay, that it is even the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> altogether. And some accordingly think it to be the blood, others the brain, others the heart; not as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>I will praise You, O Lord, with my whole heart;</q> and, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart;</q>  for this word by misapplication or metaphor is transferred from the body to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but they have simply thought it to be that small part itself of the body, which we see when the inward parts are rent asunder. Others, again, have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be made up of very minute and individual corpustules, which they call atoms, meeting in themselves and cohering. Others have said that its substance is air, others fire. Others have been of opinion that it is no substance at all, since they could not think any substance unless it is body, and they did not find that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was body; but it was in their opinion the tempering together itself of our body, or the combining together of the elements, by which that flesh is as it were conjoined. And hence all of these have held the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be mortal; since, whether it were body, or some combination of body, certainly it could not in either case continue always without death. But they who have held its substance to be some kind of life the reverse of corporeal, since they have found it to be a life that animates and quickens every living body, have by consequence striven also, according as each was able, to prove it <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, since life cannot be without life.</p>

<p>For as to that fifth kind of body, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what, which some have added to the four well-known elements of the world, and have said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was made of this, I do not think we need spend time in discussing it in this place. For either they mean by body what we mean by it, <em> viz.</em>, that of which a part is less than the whole in extension of place, and they are to be reckoned among those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the mind to be corporeal: or if they call either all substance, or all changeable substance, body, whereas they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that not all substance is contained in extension of place by any length and breadth and height, we need not contend with them about a question of words.</p>

<p>10. Now, in the case of all these opinions, any one who sees that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the mind is at once substance, and yet not corporeal&mdash;that is, that it does not occupy a less extension of place with a less part of itself, and a greater with a greater&mdash;must needs see at the same time that they who are of opinion that it is corporeal  do not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> from defect of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but because they associate with it qualities without which they are not able to conceive any nature at all. For if you bid them conceive of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> that is without corporeal phantasms, they hold it merely nothing. And so the mind would not seek itself, as though wanting to itself. For what is so present to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as that which is present to the mind? Or what is so present to the mind as the mind itself? And hence what is called <q>invention,</q> if we consider the origin of the word, what else does it mean, unless that to find out  is to <q>come into</q> that which is sought? Those things accordingly which come into the mind as it were of themselves, are not usually said to be found out,  although they may be said to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; since we did not endeavor by seeking to come into them, that is to invent or find them out. And therefore, as the mind itself really seeks those things which are sought by the eyes or by any other sense of the body (for the mind directs even the carnal sense, and then finds out or invents, when that sense comes to the things which are sought); so, too, it finds out or invents other things which it ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, not with the medium of corporeal sense, but through itself, when it <q>comes into</q> them; and this, whether in the case of the higher substance that is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or of the other parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; just as it does when it judges of bodily images themselves, for it finds these within, in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, impressed through the body.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; How the Soul Inquires into Itself. Whence Comes the Error of the Soul Concerning Itself.</h2>

<p>11. It is then a wonderful question, in what manner the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> seeks and finds itself; at what it aims in order to seek, or whither it comes, that it may come into or find out. For what is so much in the mind as the mind itself? But because it is <em>in</em> those things which it thinks of with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and is wont to be in sensible, that is, in corporeal things with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, it is unable to be in itself without the images of those corporeal things. And hence shameful <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> arises to block its way, while it cannot separate from itself the images of sensible things, so as to see itself alone. For they have marvellously cohered with it by the close adhesion of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And herein consists its uncleanness; since, while it strives to think of itself alone, it fancies itself to be that, without which it cannot think of itself. When, therefore, it is bidden to become acquainted with itself, let it not seek itself as though it were withdrawn from itself; but let it withdraw that which it has added to itself. For itself lies more deeply within, not only than those sensible things, which are clearly without, but also than the images of them; which are indeed in some part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <em> viz</em>., that which beasts also have, although these want understanding, which is proper to the mind. As therefore the mind is within, it goes forth in some sort from itself, when it exerts the affection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards these, as it were, footprints of many acts of attention. And these footprints are, as it were, imprinted on the memory, at the time when the corporeal things which are without are perceived in such way, that even when those corporeal things are absent, yet the images of them are at hand to those who think of them. Therefore let the mind become acquainted with itself, and not seek itself as if it were absent; but fix upon itself the act of [<a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>] attention, by which it was wandering among other things, and let it think of itself. So it will see that at no time did it ever not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself, at no time did it ever not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself; but by loving another thing together with itself it has confounded itself with it, and in some sense has grown one with it. And so, while it embraces diverse things, as though they were one, it has come to think those things to be one which are diverse.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; The Mind Knows Itself, by the Very Act of Understanding the Precept to Know Itself.</h2>

<p>12. Let it not therefore seek to discern itself as though absent, but take pains to discern itself as present. Nor let it take <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of itself as if it did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself, but let it distinguish itself from that which it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to be another. For how will it take pains to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> that very precept which is given it, <q>Know yourself,</q> if it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not either what <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a></q> means or what <q>yourself</q> means? But if it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> both, then it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also itself. Since <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> yourself</q> is not so said to the mind as is <q>Know the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> and the seraphim;</q> for they are absent, and we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> concerning them, and according to that belief they are declared to be certain celestial powers. Nor yet again as it is said, Know the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of that man: for this it is not within our reach to perceive at all, either by sense or understanding, unless by corporeal signs actually set forth; and this in such a way that we rather <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> than understand. Nor again as it is said to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, Behold your own face; which he can only do in a looking-glass. For even our own face itself is out of the reach of our own seeing it; because it is not there where our look can be directed. But when it is said to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, Know yourself; then it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself by that very act by which it understands the word <q>yourself;</q> and this for no other reason than that it is present to itself. But if it does not understand what is said, then certainly it does not do as it is bid to do. And therefore it is bidden to do that thing which it does do, when it understands the very precept that bids it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; Every Mind Knows Certainly Three Things Concerning Itself&mdash; That It Understands, that It Is, and that It Lives.</h2>

<p>13. Let it not then add anything to that which it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself to be, when it is bidden to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself. For it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, at any rate, that this is said to itself; namely, to the self that is, and that lives, and that understands. But a dead body also is, and cattle live; but neither a dead body nor cattle understand. Therefore it so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it so is, and that it so lives, as an understanding is and lives. When, therefore, for example's sake, the mind thinks itself air, it thinks that air understands; it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, however, that itself understands, but it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself to be air, but only thinks so. Let it separate that which it thinks itself; let it discern that which it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; let this remain to it, about which not even have they <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> who have thought the mind to be this corporeal thing or that. For certainly every mind does not consider itself to be air; but some think themselves fire, others the brain, and some one kind of corporeal thing, others another, as I have mentioned before; yet all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they themselves understand, and are, and live; but they refer understanding to that which they understand, but to be, and to live, to themselves. And no one doubts, either that no one understands who does not live, or that no one lives of whom it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that he is; and that therefore by consequence that which understands both is and lives; not as a dead body is which does not live, nor as a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> lives which does not understand, but in some proper and more excellent manner. Further, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they will, and they equally <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that no one can will who is not and who does not live; and they also refer that will itself to something which they will with that will. They <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also that they remember; and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> at the same time that nobody could remember, unless he both was and lived; but we refer memory itself also to something, in that we remember those things. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and science of many things are contained in two of these three, memory and understanding; but will must be present, that we may enjoy or use them. For we enjoy things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, in which things themselves the will finds delight for their own sake, and so reposes; but we use those things, which we refer to some other thing which we are to enjoy. Neither is the life of man vicious and culpable in any other way, than as wrongly using and wrongly enjoying. But it is no place here to discuss this.</p>

<p>14. But since we treat of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, let us remove from our consideration all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is received from without, through the senses of the body; and attend more carefully to the position which we have laid down, that all minds <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and are certain concerning themselves. For men certainly have <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether the power of living, of remembering, of understanding, of willing, of thinking, of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, of judging, be of air, or of fire, or of the brain, or of the blood, or of atoms, or besides the usual four elements of a fifth kind of body, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what; or,whether the combining or tempering together of this our flesh itself has power to accomplish these things. And one has attempted to establish this, and another to establish that. Yet who ever doubts that he himself lives, and remembers, and understands, and wills, and thinks, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, and judges? Seeing that even if he doubts, he lives; if he doubts, he remembers why he doubts; if he doubts, he understands that he doubts; if he doubts, he wishes to be certain; if he doubts, he thinks; if he doubts, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; if he doubts, he judges that he ought not to assent rashly. Whosoever therefore doubts about anything else, ought not to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of all these things; which if they were not, he would not be able to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of anything.</p>

<p>15. They who think the mind to be either a body or the combination or tempering of the body, will have all these things to seem to be in a subject, so that the substance is air, or fire, or some other corporeal thing, which they think to be the mind; but that the understanding (<em>intelligentia</em>) is in this corporeal thing as its quality, so that this corporeal thing is the subject, but the understanding is in the subject: <em>viz</em>. that the mind is the subject, which they judge to be a corporeal thing, but the understanding [intelligence], or any other of those things which we have mentioned as certain to us, is in that subject. They also hold nearly the same opinion who deny the mind itself to be body, but think it to be the combination or tempering together of the body; for there is this difference, that the former say that the mind itself is the substance, in which the understanding [intelligence] is, as in a subject; but the latter say that the mind itself is in a subject, <em>viz.</em> in the body, of which it is the combination or tempering together. And hence, by consequence, what else can they think, except that the understanding also is in the same body as in a subject?</p>

<p>16. And all these do not perceive that the mind <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself, even when it seeks for itself, as we have already shown. But nothing is at all rightly said to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> while its substance is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. And therefore, when the mind <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> its own substance; and when it is certain about itself, it as certain about its own substance. But it is certain about itself, as those things which are said above prove convincingly; although it is not at all certain whether itself is air, or fire, or some body, or some function of body. Therefore it is not any of these. And to that whole which is bidden to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself, belongs this, that it is certain that it is not any of those things of which it is uncertain, and is certain that it is that only, which only it is certain that it is. For it thinks in this way of fire, or air, and whatever else of the body it thinks of. Neither can it in any way be brought to pass that it should so think that which itself is, as it thinks that which itself is not. Since it thinks all these things through an imaginary phantasy, whether fire, or air, or this or that body, or that part or combination and tempering together of the body: nor assuredly is it said to be all those things, but some one of them. But if it were any one of them, it would think this one in a different manner from the rest <em>viz</em>. not through an imaginary phantasy, as absent things are thought, which either themselves or some of like kind have been touched by the bodily sense; but by some inward, not feigned, but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> presence (for nothing is more present to it than itself); just as it thinks that itself lives, and remembers, and understands, and wills. For it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> these things in itself, and does not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> them as though it had touched them by the sense outside itself, as corporeal things are touched. And if it attaches nothing to itself from the thought of these things, so as to think itself to be something of the kind, then whatsoever remains to it from itself that alone is itself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; In Memory, Understanding [or Intelligence], and Will, We Have to Note Ability, Learning, and Use. Memory, Understanding, and Will are One Essentially, and Three Relatively.</h2>

<p>17. Putting aside, then, for a little while all other things, of which the mind is certain concerning itself, let us especially consider and discuss these three&mdash; memory, understanding, will. For we may commonly discern in these three the character of the abilities of the young also; since the more tenaciously and easily a boy remembers, and the more acutely he understands, and the more ardently he studies, the more praiseworthy is he in point of ability. But when the question is about any one's learning, then we ask not how solidly and easily he remembers, or how shrewdly he understands; but what it is that he remembers, and what it is that he understands. And because the mind is regarded as praiseworthy, not only as being learned, but also as being good, one gives heed not only to what he remembers and what he understands, but also to what he wills (<em>velit</em>); not how ardently he wills, but first what it is he wills, and then how greatly he wills it. For the mind that loves eagerly is then to be praised, when it loves that which ought to be loved eagerly. Since, then, we speak of these three&mdash; ability, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, use&mdash; the first of these is to be considered under the three heads, of what a man can do in memory, and understanding, and will. The second of them is to be considered in regard to that which any one has in his memory and in his understanding, which he has attained by a studious will. But the third, <em>viz</em>. use, lies in the will, which handles those things that are contained in the memory and understanding, whether it refer them to anything further, or rest satisfied with them as an end. For to use, is to take up something into the power of the will; and to enjoy, is to use with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, not any longer of hope, but of the actual thing. Accordingly, every one who enjoys, uses; for he takes up something into the power of the will, wherein he also is satisfied as with an end. But not every one who uses, enjoys, if he has sought after that, which he takes up into the power of the will, not on account of the thing itself, but on account of something else.</p>

<p>18. Since, then, these three, memory, understanding, will, are not three lives, but one life; nor three minds, but one mind; it follows certainly that neither are they three substances, but one substance. Since memory, which is called life, and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and substance, is so called in respect to itself; but it is called memory, relatively to something. And I should say the same also of understanding and of will, since they are called understanding and will relatively to something; but each in respect to itself is life, and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. And hence these three are one, in that they are one life, one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; and whatever else they are severally called in respect to themselves, they are called also together, not plurally, but in the singular number. But they are three, in that wherein they are mutually referred to each other; and if they were not equal, and this not only each to each, but also each to all, they certainly could not mutually contain each other; for not only is each contained by each, but also all by each. For I remember that I have memory and understanding, and will; and I understand that I understand, and will, and remember; and I will that I will, and remember, and understand; and I remember together my whole memory, and understanding, and will. For that of my memory which I do not remember, is not in my memory; and nothing is so much in the memory as memory itself. Therefore I remember the whole memory. Also, whatever I understand I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I understand, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I will whatever I will; but whatever I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I remember. Therefore I remember the whole of my understanding, and the whole of my will. Likewise, when I understand these three things, I understand them together as whole. For there is none of things intelligible which I do not understand, except what I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; but what I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, I neither remember, nor will. Therefore, whatever of things intelligible I do not understand, it follows also that I neither remember nor will. And whatever of things intelligible I remember and will, it follows  that I understand. My will also embraces my whole understanding and my whole memory while I use the whole that I understand and remember. And, therefore, while all are mutually comprehended by each, and as wholes, each as a whole is equal to each as a whole, and each as a whole at the same time to all as wholes; and these three are one, one life, one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; The Mind is an Image of the Trinity in Its Own Memory, and Understanding, and Will.</h2>

<p>19. Are we, then, now to go upward, with whatever strength of purpose we may, to that chiefest and highest <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, of which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is an inadequate image, yet an image? Or are these same three things to be yet more distinctly made plain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by means of those things which we receive from without, through the bodily sense, wherein the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of corporeal things is impressed upon us in time? Since we found the mind itself to be such in its own memory, and understanding, and will, that since it was understood always to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and always to will itself, it was understood also at the same time always to remember itself, always to understand and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself, although not always to think of itself as <em>separate</em> from those things which are not itself; and hence its memory of itself, and understanding of itself, are with difficult discerned in it. For in this case, where these two things are very closely conjoined, and one is not preceded by the other by any time at all, it looks as if they were not two things, but one called by two names; and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself is not so plainly felt to exist when the sense of need does not disclose it, since what is loved is always at hand. And hence these things may be more lucidly set forth, even to men of duller minds, if such topics are treated of as are brought within reach of the mind in time, and happen to it in time; while it remembers what it did not remember before, and sees what it did not see before, and loves what it did not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> before. But this discussion demands now another beginning, by reason of the measure of the present book.</p>
