<h1>On the Trinity (Book XII)</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">Commencing with a distinction between wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, points out a kind of trinity, of a peculiar sort, in that which is properly called <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and which is the lower of the two; and this trinity, although it certainly pertains to the inner man, is still not yet to be called or thought an image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; Of What Kind are the Outer and the Inner Man.</h2>

<p>1. Come now, and let us see where lies, as it were, the boundary line between the outer and inner man. For whatever we have in the mind common with the beasts, thus much is rightly said to belong to the outer man. For the outer man is not to be considered to be the body only, but with the addition also of a certain peculiar life of the body, whence the structure of the body derives its vigor, and all the senses with which he is equipped for the perception of outward things; and when the images of these outward things already perceived, that have been fixed in the memory, are seen again by recollection, it is still a matter pertaining to the outer man. And in all these things we do not differ from the beasts, except that in shape of body we are not prone, but upright. And we are admonished through this, by Him who made us, not to be like the beasts in that which is our better part&mdash; that is, the mind&mdash; while we differ from them by the uprightness of the body. Not that we are to throw our mind into those bodily things which are exalted; for to seek rest for the will, even in such things, is to prostrate the mind. But as the body is naturally raised upright to those bodily things which are most elevated, that is, to things celestial; so the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is a spiritual substance, must be raised upright to those things which are most elevated in spiritual things, not by the elation of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, but by the dutifulness of righteousness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; Man Alone of Animate Creatures Perceives the Eternal Reasons of Things Pertaining to the Body.</h2>

<p>2. And the beasts, too, are able both to perceive things corporeal from without, through the senses of the body, and to fix them in the memory, and remember them, and in them to seek after things suitable, and shun things inconvenient. But to note these things, and to retain them not only as caught up naturally but also as deliberately committed to memory, and to imprint them again by recollection and conception when now just slipping away into forgetfulness; in order that as conception is formed from that which the memory contains, so also the contents themselves of the memory may be fixed firmly by thought: to combine again imaginary objects of sight, by taking this or that of what the memory remembers, and, as it were, tacking them to one another: to examine after what manner it is that in this kind things like the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> are to be distinguished from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and this not in things spiritual, but in corporeal things themselves&mdash;these acts, and the like, although performed in reference to things sensible, and those which the mind has deduced through the bodily senses, yet, as they are combined with reason, so are not common to men and beasts. But it is the part of the higher reason to judge of these corporeal things according to incorporeal and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reasons; which, unless they were above the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, would certainly not be unchangeable; and yet, unless something of our own were subjoined to them, we should not be able to employ them as our measures by which to judge of corporeal things. But we judge of corporeal things from the rule of dimensions and figures, which the mind <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to remain unchangeably. </p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; The Higher Reason Which Belongs to Contemplation, and the Lower Which Belongs to Action, are in One Mind.</h2>

<p>3. But that of our own which thus has to do with the handling of corporeal and temporal things, is indeed rational, in that it is not common to us with the beasts; but it is drawn, as it were, out of that rational substance of our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, by which we depend upon and cleave to the intelligible and unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and which is deputed to handle and direct the inferior things. For as among all the beasts there was not found for the man a help like him, unless one were taken from himself, and formed to be his consort: so for that <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, by which we consult the supernal and inward <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, there is no like help for such employment as man's nature requires among things corporeal out of those parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which we have in common with the beasts. And so a certain part of our reason, not separated so as to sever unity, but, as it were, diverted so as to be a help to fellowship, is parted off for the performing of its proper work. And as the two is one flesh in the case of male and female, so in the mind one nature embraces our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and action, or our counsel and performance, or our reason and rational appetite, or whatever other more significant terms there may be by which to express them; so that, as it was said of the former, <q>And they two shall be in one flesh,</q>  it may be said of these, they two are in one mind.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; The Trinity and the Image of God is in that Part of the Mind Alone Which Belongs to the Contemplation of Eternal Things.</h2>

<p>4. When, therefore, we discuss the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, we discuss a single subject, and do not double it into those two which I have mentioned, except in respect to its functions. Therefore, when we seek the trinity in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, we seek it in the whole <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, without separating the action of the reason in things temporal from the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, so as to have further to seek some third thing, by which a trinity may be completed. But this trinity must needs be so discovered in the whole nature of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as that even if action upon temporal things were to be withdrawn, for which work that help is necessary, with a view to which some part of the mind is diverted in order to deal with these inferior things, yet a trinity would still be found in the one mind that is no where parted off; and that when this distribution has been already made, not only a trinity may be found, but also an image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in that alone which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things; while in that other which is diverted from it in the dealing with temporal things, although there may be a trinity, yet there cannot be found an image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; The Opinion Which Devises an Image of the Trinity in the Marriage of Male and Female, and in Their Offspring.</h2>

<p>5. Accordingly they do not seem to me to advance a probable opinion, who lay it down that a trinity of the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, so far as regards <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, can so be discovered as to be completed in the marriage of male and female and in their offspring; in that the man himself, as it were, indicates the person of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but that which has so proceeded from him as to be born, that of the Son; and so the third person as of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, is, they say, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who has so proceeded from the man as not herself to be either son or daughter,  although it was by her conception that the offspring was born. For the Lord has said of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> that He proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,  and yet he is not a son. In this erroneous opinion, then, the only point probably alleged, and indeed sufficiently shown according to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, is this&mdash;in the account of the original creation of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>&mdash;that what so comes into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from some person as to make another person, cannot in every case be called a son; since the person of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from the person of the man, and yet she is not called his daughter. All the rest of this opinion is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> so absurd, nay indeed so false, that it is most easy to refute it. For I pass over such a thing, as to think the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to be the mother of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and the wife of the Father; since perhaps it may be answered that these things offend us in carnal things, because we think of bodily conceptions and births. Although these very things themselves are most chastely thought of by the pure, to whom all things are pure; but to the defiled and unbelieving, of whom both the mind and <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> are polluted, nothing is pure;  so that even Christ, born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> according to the flesh, is a stumbling-block to some of them. But yet in the case of those supreme spiritual things, after the likeness of which those kinds of the inferior creature also are made although most remotely, and where there is nothing that can be injured and nothing corruptible, nothing born in time, nothing formed from that which is formless, or whatever like expressions there may be; yet they ought not to disturb the sober <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of any one, lest in avoiding empty disgust he run into pernicious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Let him accustom himself so to find in corporeal things the traces of things spiritual, that when he begins to ascend upwards from thence, under the guidance of reason, in order to attain to the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself through which these things were made, he may not draw with himself to things above what he despises in things below. For no one ever blushed to choose for himself wisdom as a wife, because the name of wife puts into a man's thoughts the corruptible connection which consists in begetting children; or because in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> wisdom itself is a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in sex, since it is expressed in both Greek and Latin tongues by a word of the feminine gender.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. &mdash; Why This Opinion is to Be Rejected.</h2>

<p>6. We do not therefore reject this opinion, because we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to think of that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and inviolable and unchangeable Love, as the spouse of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, existing as it does from Him, but not as an offspring in order to beget the Word by which all things are made; but because <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> evidently shows it to be false. For God said, <q>Let us <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">make</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in our image, after our likeness;</q> and a little after it is said, <q>So God created man in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Certainly, in that it is of the plural number, the word <q>our</q> would not be rightly used if man were made in the image of one person, whether of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; but because he was made in the image of the Trinity, on that account it is said, <q>After our image.</q> But again, lest we should think that three Gods were to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the Trinity, whereas the same Trinity is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, it is said, <q>So God created man in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> instead of saying, <q>In His own image.</q></p>

<p>7. For such expressions are customary in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; and yet some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, while maintaining the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, do not carefully attend to them, in such wise that they think the words, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made man in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> to mean that the Father made man after the image of the Son; and they thus desire to assert that the Son also is called God in the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, as if there were not other most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> wherein the Son is called not only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. For while they aim at explaining another difficulty in this text, they become so entangled that they cannot extricate themselves. For if the Father made man after the image of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, so that he is not the image of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, then the Son is unlike the Father. But if a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> teaches us, as it does, that the Son is like the Father after an equality of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, then that which is made in the likeness of the Son must needs also be made in the likeness of the Father. Further, if the Father made man not in His own image, but in the image of His Son, why does He not say, <q>Let us make man after Your image and likeness,</q> whereas He does say, <q>our;</q> unless it be because the image of the Trinity was made in man, that in this way man should be the image of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because the Trinity itself is the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God? Such expressions are innumerable in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, but it will suffice to have produced these. It is so said in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <q>Salvation belongs unto the Lord; Your blessing is upon Your people;</q>  as if the words were spoken to some one else, not to Him of whom it had been said, <q>Salvation belongs unto the Lord.</q> And again, <q>For by You,</q> he says, <q>I shall be delivered from <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, and by hoping in my God I shall leap over the wall;</q>  as if he said to some one else, <q>By You I shall be delivered from <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q> And again, <q>In the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under You;</q>  as if he were to say, in the heart of Your enemies. For he had said to that King, that is, to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, <q>The people fall under You,</q> whom he intended by the word King, when he said, <q>In the heart of the king's enemies.</q> Things of this kind are found more rarely in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. But yet the apostle says to the Romans, <q>Concerning His Son who was made to Him of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh, and declared to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with power, according to the spirit of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, by the resurrection of the dead of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord;</q>  as though he were speaking above of some one else. For what is meant by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> declared by the resurrection of the dead of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, except of the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> who was declared to be <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with power? And as then in this passage, when we are told, <q>the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>,</q> or <q>the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> according to the spirit of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>,</q> or <q>the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> by the resurrection of the dead of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>,</q> whereas it might have been expressed in the ordinary way, In His own power, or according to the spirit of His own <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, or by the resurrection of His dead, or of their dead: as, I say, we are not compelled to understand another person, but one and the same, that is, the person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>; so, when we are told that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made man in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> although it might have been more usual to say, after His own image, yet we are not compelled to understand any other person in the Trinity, but the one and selfsame Trinity itself, who is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, and after whose image man is made.</p>

<p>8. And since the case stands thus, if we are to accept the same image of the Trinity, as not in one, but in three <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, father and mother and son, then the man was not made after the image of God before a wife was made for him, and before they procreated a son; because there was not yet a trinity. Will any one say there was already a trinity, because, although not yet in their proper form, yet in their original nature, both the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was already in the side of the man, and the son in the loins of his father? Why then, when Scripture had said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made man after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> did it go on to say, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created him; male and female created He them: and God blessed them</q>?  (Or if it is to be so divided, <q>And God created man,</q> so that thereupon is to be added, <q>in the image of God created He him,</q> and then subjoined in the third place, <q>male and female created He them;</q> for some have feared to say, He made him male and female, lest something monstrous, as it were, should be understood, as are those whom they call hermaphrodites, although even so both might be understood not <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> in the singular number, on account of that which is said, <q>Two in one flesh.</q>) Why then, as I began by saying, in regard to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of man made after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does Scripture specify nothing except male and female? Certainly, in order to complete the image of the Trinity, it ought to have added also son, although still placed in the loins of his father, as the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was in his side. Or was it perhaps that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> also had been already made, and that Scripture had combined in a short and comprehensive statement, that of which it was going to explain afterwards more carefully, how it was done; and that therefore a son could not be mentioned, because no son was yet born? As if the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> could not have comprehended this, too, in that brief statement, while about to narrate the birth of the son afterwards in its own place; as it narrated afterwards in its own place, that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was taken from the side of the man,  and yet has not omitted here to name her.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; How Man is the Image of God. Whether the Woman is Not Also the Image of God. How the Saying of the Apostle, that the Man is the Image of God, But the Woman is the Glory of the Man, is to Be Understood Figuratively and Mystically.</h2>

<p>9. We ought not therefore so to understand that man is made in the image of the supreme Trinity, that is, in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as that the same image should be understood to be in three <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings; especially when the apostle says that the man is the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and on that account removes the covering from his head, which he warns the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to use, speaking thus: <q>For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the man.</q> What then shall we say to this? If the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> fills up the image of the trinity after the measure of her own person, why is the man still called that image after she has been taken out of his side? Or if even one person of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being out of three can be called the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as each person also is God in the supreme Trinity itself, why is the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> also not the image of God? For she is instructed for this very reason to cover her head, which he is forbidden to do because he is the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<p>10. But we must notice how that which the apostle says, that not the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> but the man is the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is not contrary to that which is written in Genesis, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created man: in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them: and He blessed them.</q> For this text says that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself, which is complete [only] in both sexes, was made in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and it does not separate the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from the image of God which it signifies. For after saying that God made man in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>He created him,</q> it says, <q>male and female:</q> or at any rate, punctuating the words otherwise, <q>male and female created He them.</q> How then did the apostle tell us that the man is the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore he is forbidden to cover his head; but that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is not so, and therefore is commanded to cover hers? Unless, forsooth, according to that which I have said already, when I was treating of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> together with her own husband is the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that that whole substance may be one image; but when she is referred separately to her quality of <em>help-meet</em>, which regards the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> herself alone, then she is not the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but as regards the man alone, he is the image of God as fully and completely as when the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> too is joined with him in one. As we said of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that both in the case when as a whole it contemplates the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it is the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and in the case when anything is divided from it, and diverted in order to the cognition of temporal things; nevertheless on that side on which it beholds and consults <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, here also it is the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but on that side whereby it is directed to the cognition of the lower things, it is not the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And since it is so much the more formed after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the more it has extended itself to that which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and is on that account not to be restrained, so as to withhold and refrain itself from thence; therefore the man ought not to cover his head. But because too great a progression towards inferior things is dangerous to that rational cognition that is conversant with things corporeal and temporal; this ought to have power on its head, which the covering indicates, by which it is signified that it ought to be restrained. For a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> meaning is pleasing to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.  For God sees not after the way of time, neither does anything new take place in His vision and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, when anything is done in time and transitorily, after the way in which such things affect the senses, whether the carnal senses of animals and men, or even the heavenly senses of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<p>11. For that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, when speaking outwardly of the sex of male and female, figured the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of some more hidden <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, may be understood from this, that when he says in another place that she is a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> indeed who is desolate, without children and nephews, and yet that she ought to trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to continue in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> night and day,  he here indicates, that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> having been brought into the transgression by being deceived, is brought to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by child-bearing; and then he has added, <q>If they continue in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and charity, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, with sobriety.</q>  As if it could possibly hurt a good <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, if either she had not sons, or if those whom she had did not choose to continue in good works. But because those things which are called good works are, as it were, the sons of our life, according to that sense of life in which it answers to the question, What is a man's life? That is, How does he act in these temporal things? Which life the Greeks do not call <span class="greek">&#x03BE;&#x03C9;&#x1F75;</span> but <span class="greek">&#x03B2;&#x1F77;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>; and because these good works are chiefly performed in the way of offices of mercy, while works of mercy are of no profit, either to Pagans, or to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or to any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or schismstics whatsoever in whom <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and charity and sober <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> are not found: what the apostle meant to signify is plain, and in so far figuratively and <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a>, because he was speaking of covering the head of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, which will remain mere empty words, unless referred to some hidden sacrament.</p>

<p>12. For, as not only most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reason but also the authority of the apostle himself declares, man was not made in the image of God according to the shape of his body, but according to his rational mind. For the thought is a debased and empty one, which holds God to be circumscribed and limited by the lineaments of bodily members. But further, does not the same blessed apostle say, <q>Be renewed in the spirit of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and put on the new man, which is created after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q>  and in another place more clearly, <q>Putting off the old man,</q> he says, <q>with his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; put on the new man, which is renewed to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God after the image of Him that created him?</q>  If, then, we are renewed in the spirit of our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and he is the new man who is renewed to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God after the image of Him that created him; no one can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that man was made after the image of Him that created him, not according to the body, nor indiscriminately according to any part of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but according to the rational <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, wherein the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God can exist. And it is according to this renewal, also, that we are made sons of God by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ; and putting on the new man, certainly put on Christ through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Who is there, then, who will hold <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to be alien from this fellowship, whereas they are fellow-heirs of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> with us; and whereas in another place the same apostle says, <q>For you are all the children of God by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Christ Jesus; for as many as have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ have put on Christ: there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus?</q>  Pray, have faithful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> then lost their bodily sex? But because they are there renewed after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where there is no sex; man is there made after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where there is no sex, that is, in the spirit of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Why, then, is the man on that account not bound to cover his head, because he is the image and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is bound to do so, because she is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the man; as though the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> were not renewed in the spirit of her <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which spirit is renewed to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God after the image of Him who created him? But because she differs from the man in bodily sex, it was possible rightly to represent under her bodily covering that part of the reason which is diverted to the government of temporal things; so that the image of God may remain on that side of the mind of man on which it cleaves to the beholding or the consulting of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> reasons of things; and this, it is clear, not men only, but also <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> have.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; Turning Aside from the Image of God.</h2>

<p>13. A common nature, therefore, is recognized in their minds, but in their bodies a division of that one mind itself is figured. As we ascend, then, by certain steps of thought within, along the succession of the parts of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, there where something first meets us which is not common to ourselves with the beasts reason begins, so that here the inner man can now be recognized. And if this inner man himself, through that reason to which the administering of things temporal has been delegated, slips on too far by over-much progress into outward things, that which is his head moreover consenting, that is, the (so to call it) masculine part which presides in the watchtower of counsel not restraining or bridling it: then he waxes old because of all his enemies,  <em>viz</em>. the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> with their prince the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who are <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and that vision of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things is withdrawn also from the head himself, eating with his spouse that which was forbidden, so that the light of his eyes is gone from him;  and so both being naked from that enlightenment of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and with the eyes of their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> opened to behold how they were left shameful and unseemly, like the leaves of sweet fruits, but without the fruits themselves, they so weave together good words without the fruit of good works, as while living wickedly to cover over their disgrace as it were by speaking well. </p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; The Same Argument is Continued.</h2>

<p>14. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> loving its own power, slips onwards from the whole which is common, to a part, which belongs especially to itself. And that apostatizing <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which is called <q>the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q>  whereas it might have been most excellently governed by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if it had followed Him as its ruler in the universal creature, by seeking something more than the whole, and struggling to govern this by a law of its own, is thrust on, since nothing is more than the whole, into caring for a part; and thus by lusting after something more, is made less; whence also <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is called <q>the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q>  And it administers that whole, wherein it strives to do something of its own against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> by which the whole is governed, by its own body, which it possesses only in part; and so being delighted by corporeal forms and motions, because it has not the things themselves within itself, and because it is wrapped up in their images, which it has fixed in the memory, and is foully polluted by fornication of the phantasy, while it refers all its functions to those ends, for which it curiously seeks corporeal and temporal things through the senses of the body, either it affects with swelling arrogance to be more excellent than other <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are given up to the corporeal senses, or it is plunged into a foul whirlpool of carnal pleasure.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; The Lowest Degradation Reached by Degrees.</h2>

<p>15. When the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> then consults either for itself or for others with a good will towards perceiving the inner and higher things, such as are possessed in a chaste embrace, without any narrowness or <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, not individually, but in common by all who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> such things; then even if it be deceived in anything, through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of things temporal (for its action in this case is a temporal one), and if it does not hold fast to that mode of acting which it ought, the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> is but one common to man. And it is a great thing so to pass through this life, on which we travel, as it were, like a road on our return home, that no <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> may take us, but what is common to man.  For this is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, without the body, and must not be reckoned fornication, and on that account is very easily pardoned. But when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does anything in order to attain those things which are perceived through the body, through <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of proving or of surpassing or of handling them, in order that it may place in them its final good, then whatever it does, it does wickedly, and commits fornication, sinning against its own body:  and while snatching from within the deceitful images of corporeal things, and combining them by vain thought, so that nothing seems to it to be divine, unless it be of such a kind as this; by selfish greediness it is made fruitful in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, and by selfish prodigality it is emptied of strength. Yet it would not leap on at once from the commencement to such shameless and miserable fornication, but, as it is written, <q>He that despises small things, shall fall little by little.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; The Image of the Beast in Man.</h2>

<p>16. For as a snake does not creep on with open steps, but advances by the very minutest efforts of its several scales; so the slippery motion of falling away [from what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>] takes possession of the negligent only gradually, and beginning from a perverse desire for the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, arrives in the end at the likeness of beasts. Hence it is that being naked of their first garment, they earned by mortality coats of skins.  For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of man is the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is not preserved except it be in relation to Him by whom it is impressed. The less therefore that one loves what is one's own, the more one cleaves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But through the desire of making trial of his own power, man by his own bidding falls down to himself as to a sort of intermediate grade. And so, while he wishes to be as God is, that is, under no one, he is thrust on, even from his own middle grade, by way of punishment, to that which is lowest, that is, to those things in which beasts delight: and thus, while his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but his dishonor is the likeness of the beast, <q>Man being in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> abides not: he is compared to the beasts that are foolish, and is made like to them.</q>  By what path, then, could he pass so great a distance from the highest to the lowest, except through his own intermediate grade? For when he neglects the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of wisdom, which remains always after the same fashion, and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> after <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by experiment upon things temporal and mutable, that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> puffs up, it does not edify:  so the mind is overweighed and thrust out, as it were, by its own weight from blessedness; and learns by its own punishment, through that trial of its own intermediateness, what the difference is between the good it has abandoned and the bad to which it has committed itself; and having thrown away and destroyed its strength, it cannot return, unless by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of its Maker calling it to repentance, and forgiving its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For who will deliver the unhappy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body of this death, unless the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord?  of which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we will discourse in its place, so far as He Himself enables us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; There is a Kind of Hidden Wedlock in the Inner Man. Unlawful Pleasures of the Thoughts.</h2>

<p>17. Let us now complete, so far as the Lord helps us, the discussion which we have undertaken, respecting that part of reason to which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> belongs, that is, the cognizance of things temporal and changeable, which is necessary for managing the affairs of this life. For as in the case of that visible wedlock of the two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings who were made first, the serpent did not eat of the forbidden tree, but only persuaded them to eat of it; and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> did not eat alone, but gave to her husband, and they eat together; although she alone spoke with the serpent, and she alone was led away by him:  so also in the case of that hidden and secret kind of wedlock, which is transacted and discerned in a single <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, the carnal, or as I may say, since it is directed to the senses of the body, the sensuous movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is common to us with beasts, is shut off from the reason of wisdom. For certainly bodily things are perceived by the sense of the body; but spiritual things, which are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and unchangeable, are understood by the reason of wisdom. But the reason of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> has appetite very near to it: seeing that what is called the science or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of actions reasons concerning the bodily things which are perceived by the bodily sense; if well, in order that it may refer that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to the end of the chief good; but if ill, in order that it may enjoy them as being such <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things as those wherein it reposes with a false blessedness. Whenever, then, that carnal or animal sense introduces into this purpose of the mind which is conversant about things temporal and corporeal, with a view to the offices of a man's actions, by the living force of reason, some inducement to enjoy itself, that is, to enjoy itself as if it were some private good of its own, not as the public and common, which is the unchangeable, good; then, as it were, the serpent discourses with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. And to consent to this allurement, is to eat of the forbidden tree. But if that consent is satisfied by the pleasure of thought alone, but the members are so restrained by the authority of higher counsel that they are not yielded as instruments of unrighteousness unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;  this, I think, is to be considered as if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> alone should have eaten the forbidden food. But if, in this consent to use wickedly the things which are perceived through the senses of the body, any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all is so determined upon, that if there is the power it is also fulfilled by the body; then that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> must be understood to have given the unlawful food to her husband with her, to be eaten together. For it is not possible for the mind to determine that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not only to be thought of with pleasure, but also to be effectually committed, unless also that intention of the mind yields, and serves the bad action, with which rests the chief power of applying the members to an outward act, or of restraining them from one.</p>

<p>18. And yet, certainly, when the mind is pleased in thought alone with unlawful things, while not indeed determining that they are to be done, but yet holding and pondering gladly things which ought to have been rejected the very moment they touched the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, it cannot be denied to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but far less than if it were also determined to accomplished it in outward act. And therefore pardon must be sought for such thoughts too, and the breast must be smitten, and it must be said, <q>Forgive us our debts;</q> and what follows must be done, and must be joined in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>As we also forgive our debtors.</q>  For it is not as it was with those two first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, of which each one bare his own person; and so, if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> alone had eaten the forbidden food, she certainly alone would have been smitten with the punishment of death: it cannot, I say, be so said also in the case of a single <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being now, that if the thought, remaining alone, be gladly fed with unlawful pleasures, from which it ought to turn away directly, while yet there is no determination that the bad actions are to be done, but only that they are retained with pleasure in remembrance, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> as it were can be condemned without the man. Far be it from us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this. For here is one person, one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, and he as a whole will be condemned, unless those things which, as lacking the will to do, and yet having the will to please the mind with them, are perceived to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of thought alone, are pardoned through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Mediator. </p>

<p>19. This reasoning, then, whereby we have sought in the mind of each several <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being a certain rational wedlock of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and action, with functions distributed through each severally, yet with the unity of the mind preserved in both; saving meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of that <em> history</em> which divine testimony hands down respecting the first two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, that is, the man and his wife, from whom the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> species is propagated; &mdash; this reasoning, I say, must be listened to only thus far, that the apostle may be understood to have intended to signify something to be sought in one individual man, by assigning the image of God to the man only, and not also to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, although in the merely different sex of two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; The Opinion of Those Who Have Thought that the Mind Was Signified by the Man, the Bodily Sense by the Woman.</h2>

<p>20. Nor does it escape me, that some who before us were eminent defenders of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and expounders of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while they looked for these two things in one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, whose entire <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> they perceived to be a sort of excellent paradise, asserted that the man was the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was the bodily sense. And according to this distribution, by which the man is assumed to be the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> the bodily sense, all things seem aptly to agree together if they are handled with due attention: unless that it is written, that in all the beasts and flying things there was not found for man an helpmate like to himself; and then the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was made out of his side.  And on this account I, for my part, have not thought that the bodily sense should be taken for the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, which we see to be common to ourselves  and to the beasts; but I have desired to find something which the beasts had not; and I have rather thought the bodily sense should be understood to be the serpent, whom we read to have been more subtle than all beasts of the field.  For in those natural <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which we see are common to ourselves and to the irrational animals, the sense excels by a kind of living power; not the sense of which it is written in the epistle addressed to the Hebrews, where we read, that <q>strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>;</q>  for these <q>senses</q> belong to the rational nature and pertain to the understanding; but that sense which is divided into five parts in the body, through which corporeal species and motion is perceived not only by ourselves, but also by the beasts.</p>

<p>21. But whether that the apostle calls the man the image and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the man,  is to be received in this, or that, or in any other way; yet it is clear, that when we live according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our mind which is intent on the invisible things of Him ought to be fashioned with proficiency from His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, charity; but that something of our own rational purpose, that is, of the same <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, must be directed to the using of changeable and corporeal things, without which this life does not go on; not that we may be conformed to this world,  by placing our end in such <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and by forcing the desire of blessedness towards them, but that whatever we do rationally in the using of temporal things, we may do it with the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of attaining <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things, passing through the former, but cleaving to the latter.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; What is the Difference Between Wisdom and Knowledge. The Worship of God is the Love of Him. How the Intellectual Cognizance of Eternal Things Comes to Pass Through Wisdom.</h2>

<p>For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> also has its own good measure, if that in it which puffs up, or is wont to puff up, is conquered by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things, which does not puff up, but, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, edifies.  Certainly without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> themselves, by which one lives rightly, cannot be possessed, by which this miserable life may be so governed, that we may attain to that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> blessed.</p>

<p>22. Yet action, by which we use temporal things well, differs from <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things; and the latter is reckoned to wisdom, the former to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For although that which is wisdom can also be called <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, as the apostle too speaks, where he says, <q>Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part, but then shall I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even as also I am <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>;</q>  when doubtless he meant his words to be understood of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which will be the highest reward of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; yet where he says, <q>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by the same Spirit,</q>  certainly he distinguishes without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> these two things, although he does not there explain the difference, nor in what way one may be discerned from the other. But having examined a great number of passages from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, I find it written in the Book of Job, that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man being the speaker, <q>Behold, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, that is wisdom; but to depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q>  In thus distinguishing, it must be understood that wisdom belongs to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to action. For in this place he meant by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which in Greek is called <span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x1F73;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span> . For the sentence in the Greek mss. has that word. And what is there in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things more excellent than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of whom alone the nature is unchangeable? And what is the worship of Him except the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Him, by which we now desire to see Him, and we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and hope that we shall see Him; and in proportion as we make progress, see now through a glass in an enigma, but then in clearness? For this is what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> means by <q>face to face.</q>  This is also what John says, <q>Beloved, now we are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it does not yet appear what we shall be; but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.</q>  Discourse about these and the like subjects seems to me to be the discourse itself of wisdom. But to depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which Job says is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, is without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of temporal things. Since it is in reference to time [and this world] that we are in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, from which we ought to abstain that we may come to those good <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things. And therefore, whatsoever we do prudently, boldly, temperately, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, belongs to that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or discipline wherewith our action is conversant in avoiding <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and desiring good; and so also, whatsoever we gather by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that comes from inquiry, in the way of examples either to be guarded against or to be imitated, and in the way of necessary <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> respecting any subject, accommodated to our use.</p>

<p>23. When a discourse then relates to these things, I hold it to be a discourse belonging to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and to be distinguished from a discourse belonging to wisdom, to which those things belong, which neither have been, nor shall be, but are; and on account of that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in which they are, are said to have been, and to be, and to be about to be, without any changeableness of times. For neither have they been in such way as that they should cease to be, nor are they about to be in such way as if they were not now; but they have always had and always will have that very absolute being. And they abide, but not as if fixed in some place as are bodies; but as intelligible things in incorporeal nature, they are so at hand to the glance of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as things visible or tangible in place are to the sense of the body. And not only in the case of sensible things posited in place, there abide also intelligible and incorporeal reasons of them apart from local space; but also of motions that pass by in successive times, apart from any transit in time, there stand also like reasons, themselves certainly intelligible, and not sensible. And to attain to these with the eye of the mind is the lot of few; and when they are attained as much as they can be, he himself who attains to them does not abide in them, but is as it were repelled by the rebounding of the eye itself of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and so there comes to be a transitory thought of a thing not transitory. And yet this transient thought is committed to the memory through the instructions by which the mind is taught; that the mind which is compelled to pass from thence, may be able to return there again; although, if the thought should not return to the memory and find there what it had committed to it, it would be led thereto like an uninstructed person, as it had been led before, and would find it where it had first found it, that is to say, in that incorporeal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whence yet once more it may be as it were written down and fixed in the mind. For the thought of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for example, does not so abide in that incorporeal and unchangeable reason of a square body, as that reason itself abides: if, to be sure, it could attain to it at all without the phantasy of local space. Or if one were to apprehend the rhythm of any artificial or musical sound, passing through certain intervals of time, as it rested without time in some secret and deep silence, it could at least be thought as long as that song could be heard; yet what the glance of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, transient though it was, caught from thence, and, absorbing as it were into a belly, so laid up in the memory, over this it will be able to rumiuate in some measure by recollection, and to transfer what it has thus learned into systematic <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But if this has been blotted out by absolute forgetfulness, yet once again, under the guidance of teaching, one will come to that which had altogether dropped away, and it will be found such as it was.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; In Opposition to the Reminiscence of Plato and Pythagoras. Pythagoras the Samian. Of the Difference Between Wisdom and Knowledge, and of Seeking the Trinity in the Knowledge of Temporal Things.</h2>

<p>24. And hence that noble <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> endeavored to persuade us that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men lived even before they bare these bodies; and that hence those things which are learned are rather remembered, as having been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> already, than taken into <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as things new. For he has told us that a boy, when questioned I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what respecting geometry, replied as if he were perfectly skilled in that branch of learning. For being questioned step by step and skillfully, he saw what was to be seen, and said that which he saw.  But if this had been a recollecting of things previously <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, then certainly every one, or almost every one, would not have been able so to answer when questioned. For not every one was a geometrician in the former life, since geometricians are so few among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that scarcely one can be found anywhere. But we ought rather to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that the intellectual mind is so formed in its nature as to see those things, which by the disposition of the Creator are subjoined to things intelligible in a natural order, by a sort of incorporeal light of an unique kind; as the eye of the flesh sees things adjacent to itself in this bodily light, of which light it is made to be receptive, and adapted to it. For none the more does this fleshly eye, too, distinguish black things from white without a teacher, because it had already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> them before it was created in this flesh. Why, lastly, is it possible only in intelligible things that any one properly questioned should answer according to any branch of learning, although <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it? Why can no one do this with things sensible, except those which he has seen in this his present body, or has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the information of others who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them, whether somebody's writings or words? For we must not acquiesce in their story, who assert that the Samian Pythagoras recollected some things of this kind, which he had experienced when he was previously here in another body; and others tell yet of others, that they experienced something of the same sort in their minds: but it may be conjectured that these were untrue recollections, such as we commonly experience in sleep, when we fancy we remember, as though we had done or seen it, what we never did or saw at all; and that the minds of these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, even though awake, were affected in this way at the suggestion of malignant and deceitful spirits, whose care it is to confirm or to sow some false belief concerning the changes of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, in order to deceive men. This, I say, may be conjectured from this, that if they really remembered those things which they had seen here before, while occupying other bodies, the same thing would happen to many, nay to almost all; since they suppose that as the dead from the living, so, without cessation and continually, the living are coming into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from the dead; as sleepers from those that are awake, and those that are awake from them that sleep.</p>

<p>25. If therefore this is the right distinction between wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that the intellectual cognizance of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things belongs to wisdom, but the rational cognizance of temporal things to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it is not difficult to judge which is to be preferred or postponed to which. But if we must employ some other distinction by which to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these two apart, which without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the apostle teaches us are different, saying, <q>To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, by the same Spirit:</q> still the difference between those two which we have laid down is a most evident one, in that the intellectual cognizance of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things is one thing, the rational cognizance of temporal things another; and no one doubts but that the former is to be preferred to the latter. As then we leave behind those things which belong to the outer man, and desire to ascend within from those things which we have in common with beasts, before we come to the cognizance of things intelligible and supreme, which are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, the rational cognizance of temporal things presents itself. Let us then find a trinity in this also, if we can, as we found one in the senses of the body, and in those things which through them entered in the way of images into our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or spirit; so that instead of corporeal things which we touch by corporeal sense, placed as they are without us, we might have resemblances of bodies impressed within on the memory from which thought might be formed, while the will as a third united them; just as the sight of the eyes was formed from without, which the will applied to the visible thing in order to produce vision, and united both, while itself also added itself thereto as a third. But this subject must not be compressed into this book; so that in that which follows, if God help, it may be suitably examined, and the conclusions to which we come may be unfolded.</p>
