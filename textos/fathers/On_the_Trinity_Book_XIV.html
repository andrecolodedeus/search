<h1>On the Trinity (Book XIV)</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom of man is treated of; and it is shown that the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which man is in respect to his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, is not placed properly in transitory things, as in memory, understanding, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, whether of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself as existing in time, or even of the mind as busied with itself, but in things that are permanent; and that this wisdom is then perfected, when the mind is renewed in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the image of Him who created man after His own Image, and thus attains to wisdom, wherein that which is contemplated is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; What the Wisdom is of Which We are Here to Treat. Whence the Name of Philosopher Arose. What Has Been Already Said Concerning the Distinction of Knowledge and Wisdom.</h2>

<p>1. We must now discourse concerning wisdom; not the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for His only-begotten Son is called the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;  but we will speak of the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, yet of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom, which is according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and chief worship, which is called in Greek by one term, <span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x1F73;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span> . And this term, as we have already observed, when our own countrymen themselves also wished to interpret it by a single term, was by them rendered <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> means more commonly what the Greeks call <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x1F73;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span> . But because <span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x1F73;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span> cannot be translated perfectly by any one word, it is better translated by two, so as to render it rather by <q>the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> That this is the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as we have already laid down in the twelfth book  of this work, is shown by the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, in the book of God's servant Job, where we read that the Wisdom of God said to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <q>Behold <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, that is wisdom; and to depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>;</q>  or, as some have translated the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F75;&#x03BC;&#x03B7;&#x03BD;</span>, <q>learning,</q>  which certainly takes its name from learning,  whence also it may be called <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For everything is learned in order that it may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Although the same word, indeed,  is employed in a different sense, where any one suffers <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that he may be corrected. Whence is that in the Epistle to the Hebrews, <q>For what son is he to whom the father gives not discipline?</q> And this is still more apparent in the same epistle: <q>Now no chastening  for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.</q>  Therefore God Himself is the chiefest wisdom; but the worship of God is the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, of which we now speak. For <q>the wisdom of this world is foolishness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  It is in respect to this wisdom, therefore, which is the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> says, <q>The multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world.</q> </p>

<p>2. But if to dispute of wisdom belongs to wise men, what shall we do? Shall we dare indeed to profess wisdom, lest it should be mere impudence for ourselves to dispute about it? Shall we not be alarmed by the example of Pythagoras?&mdash; who dared not profess to be a wise man, but answered that he was a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, <em>i.e.</em>, a lover of wisdom; whence arose the name, that became thenceforth so much the popular name, that no matter how great the learning wherein any one excelled, either in his own opinion or that of others, in things pertaining to wisdom, he was still called nothing more than <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. Or was it for this reason that no one, even of such as these, dared to profess himself a wise man&mdash;because they imagined that a wise man was one without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? But our Scriptures do not say this, which say, <q>Rebuke a wise man, and he will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you.</q>  For doubtless he who thinks a man ought to be rebuked, judges him to have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. However, for my part, I dare not profess myself a wise man even in this sense; it is enough for me to assume, what they themselves cannot deny, that to dispute of wisdom belongs also to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, <em>i.e</em>., the lover of wisdom. For they have not given over so disputing who have professed to be lovers of wisdom rather than wise men.</p>

<p>3. In disputing, then, about wisdom, they have defined it thus: Wisdom is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and divine. And hence, in the last book, I have not withheld the admission, that the cognizance of both subjects, whether divine or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, may be called both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and wisdom.  But according to the distinction made in the apostle's words, <q>To one is given the word of wisdom, to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,</q>  this definition is to be divided, so that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things divine shall be called wisdom, and that of things <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> appropriate to itself the name of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and of the latter I have treated in the thirteenth book, not indeed so as to attribute to this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> everything whatever that can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by man about things <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, wherein there is exceeding much of empty vanity and mischievous curiosity, but only those things by which that most wholesome <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which leads to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> blessedness, is begotten, nourished, defended, strengthened; and in this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> most of the faithful are not strong, however exceeding strong in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself. For it is one thing to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only what man ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in order to attain to a blessed life, which must needs be an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> one; but another to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what way this belief itself may both help the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and be defended against the impious, which last the apostle seems to call by the special name of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And when I was speaking of this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> before, my special business was to commend <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, first briefly distinguishing things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> from things temporal, and there discoursing of things temporal; but while deferring things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> to the present book, I showed also that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> respecting things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> is itself a thing temporal, and dwells in time in the hearts of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and yet is necessary in order to attain the things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> themselves.  I argued also, that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> respecting the things temporal which He that is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> did and suffered for us as man, which manhood He bare in time and carried on to things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, is profitable also for the obtaining of things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; and that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> themselves, whereby in this temporal and mortal life men live prudently, bravely, temperately, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, unless they are referred to that same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, temporal though it is, which leads on nevertheless to things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; There is a Kind of Trinity in the Holding, Contemplating, and Loving of Faith Temporal, But One that Does Not Yet Attain to Being Properly an Image of God.</h2>

<p>4. Wherefore since, as it is written, <q>While we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord; for we walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not by sight;</q>  undoubtedly, so long as the just man lives by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,  howsoever he lives according to the inner man, although he aims at <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and reaches on to things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> by this same temporal <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nevertheless in the holding, contemplating, and loving this temporal <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we have not yet reached such a trinity as is to be called an image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; lest that should seem to be constituted in things temporal which ought to be so in things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. For when the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind sees its own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereby it believes what it does not see, it does not see a thing <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. For that will not always exist, which certainly will not then exist, when this pilgrimage, whereby we are absent from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in such way that we must needs walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, shall be ended, and that sight shall have succeeded it whereby we shall see face to face;  just as now, because we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> although we do not see, we shall deserve to see, and shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at having been brought through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to sight. For then it will be no longer <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by which that is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> which is not seen; but sight, by which that is seen which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. And then, therefore, although we remember this past mortal life, and call to mind by recollection that we once <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> what we did not see, yet that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will be reckoned among things past and done with, not among things present and always continuing. And hence also that trinity which now consists in the remembering, contemplating, and loving this same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> while present and continuing, will then be found to be done with and past, and not still enduring. And hence it is to be gathered, that if that trinity is indeed an image  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then this image itself would have to be reckoned, not among things that exist always, but among things transient.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; A Difficulty Removed, Which Lies in the Way of What Has Just Been Said.</h2>

<p>But far be it from us to think, that while the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and from the first beginning of its creation thenceforth never ceases to be, yet that that which is the best thing it has should not endure for ever with its own <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. Yet what is there in its nature as created, better than that it is made after the image of its Creator?  We must find then what may be fittingly called the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not in the holding, contemplating, and loving that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which will not exist always, but in that which will exist always.</p>

<p>5. Shall we then scrutinize somewhat more carefully and deeply whether the case is really thus? For it may be said that this trinity does not perish even when <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself shall have passed away; because, as now we both hold it by memory, and discern it by thought, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it by will; so then also, when we shall both hold in memory, and shall recollect, that we once had it, and shall unite these two by the third, namely will, the same trinity will still continue. Since, if it have left in its passage as it were no trace in us, doubtless we shall not have ought of it even in our memory, whereto to recur when recollecting it as past, and by the third, <em>viz</em>. purpose, coupling both these, to wit, what was in our memory though we were not thinking about it, and what is formed thence by conception. But he who speaks thus, does not perceive, that when we hold, see, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in ourselves our present <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we are concerned with a different trinity as now existing, from that trinity which will exist, when we shall contemplate by recollection, not the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself, but as it were the imagined trace of it laid up in the memory, and shall unite by the will, as by a third, these two things, <em>viz</em>. that which was in the memory of him who retains, and that which is impressed thence upon the vision of the mind of him who recollects. And that we may understand this, let us take an example from things corporeal, of which we have sufficiently spoken in the eleventh book.  For as we ascend from lower to higher things, or pass inward from outer to inner things, we first find a trinity in the bodily object which is seen, and in the vision of the seer, which, when he sees it, is informed thereby, and in the purpose of the will which combines both. Let us assume a trinity like this, when the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is now in ourselves is so established in our memory as the bodily object we spoke of was in place, from which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is formed the conception in recollection, as from that bodily object was formed the vision of the beholder; and to these two, to complete the trinity, will is to be reckoned as a third, which connects and combines the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> established in the memory, and a sort of effigy of that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> impressed upon the vision of recollection; just as in that trinity of corporeal vision, the form of the bodily object that is seen, and the corresponding form wrought in the vision of the beholder, are combined by the purpose of the will. Suppose, then, that this bodily object which was beheld was dissolved and had perished, and that nothing at all of it remained anywhere, to the vision of which the gaze might have recourse; are we then to say, that because the image of the bodily object thus now past and done with remains in the memory, whence to form the conception in recollecting, and to have the two united by will as a third, therefore it is the same trinity as that former one, when the appearance of the bodily object posited in place was seen? Certainly not, but altogether a different one: for, not to say that that was from without, while this is from within; the former certainly was produced by the appearance of a present bodily object, the latter by the image of that object now past. So, too, in the case of which we are now treating, to illustrate which we have thought good to adduce this example, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is even now in our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as that bodily object was in place, while held, looked at, loved, produces a sort of trinity; but that trinity will exist no more, when this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, like that bodily object in place, shall no longer exist. But that which will then exist, when we shall remember it to have been, but not now to be, in us, will doubtless be a different one. For that which now is, is wrought by the thing itself, actually present and attached to the mind of one who believes; but that which shall then be, will be wrought by the imagination of a past thing left in the memory of one who recollects.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; The Image of God is to Be Sought in the Immortality of the Rational Soul. How a Trinity is Demonstrated in the Mind.</h2>

<p>6. Therefore neither is that trinity an image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is not now, nor is that other an image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which then will not be; but we must find in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <em>i.e.</em>, the rational or intellectual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that image of the Creator which is immortally implanted in its <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. For as the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> itself of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is spoken with a qualification; since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> too has its proper death, when it lacks a blessed life, which is to be called the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but it is therefore called <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, because it never ceases to live with some life or other, even when it is most miserable&mdash;so, although reason or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is at one time torpid in it, at another appears small, and at another great, yet the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is never anything save rational or intellectual; and hence, if it is made after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in respect to this, that it is able to use reason and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in order to understand and behold <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then from the moment when that nature so marvellous and so great began to be, whether this image be so worn out as to be almost none at all, or whether it be obscure and defaced, or bright and beautiful, certainly it always is. Further, too, pitying the defaced condition of its dignity, <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> tells us, that <q>although man walks in an image, yet he disquiets himself in vain; he heaps up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.</q>  It would not therefore attribute vanity to the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless it perceived it to have been defaced. Yet it sufficiently shows that such defacing does not extend to the taking away its being an image, by saying, <q>Although man walks in an image.</q> Wherefore in both ways that sentence can be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> enunciated; in that, as it is said, <q>Although man walks in an image, yet he disquiets himself in vain,</q> so it may be said, <q>Although man disquiets himself in vain, yet he walks in an image.</q> For although the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is great, yet it can be corrupted, because it is not the highest; and although it can be corrupted, because it is not the highest, yet because it is capable and can be partaker of the highest nature, it is a great nature. Let us seek, then, in this image of God a certain trinity of a special kind, with the aid of Him who Himself made us after His own image. For no otherwise can we healthfully investigate this subject, or arrive at any result according to the wisdom which is from Him. But if the reader will either hold in remembrance and recollect what we have said of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or mind in former books, and especially in the tenth, or will carefully re-peruse it in the passages wherein it is contained, he will not require here any more lengthy discourse respecting the inquiry into so great a thing.</p>

<p>7. We said, then, among other things in the tenth book, that the mind of man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself. For the mind <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing so much as that which is close to itself; and nothing is more close to the mind than itself. We adduced also other evidences, as much as seemed sufficient, whereby this might be most certainly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; Whether the Mind of Infants Knows Itself.</h2>

<p>What, then, is to be said of the mind of an infant, which is still so small, and buried in such profound <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of things, that the mind of a man which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> anything shrinks from the darkness of it? Is that too to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself; but that, as being too intent upon those things which it has begun to perceive through the bodily senses, with the greater delight in proportion to their novelty, it is not able indeed to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of itself, but is also not able to think of itself? Moreover, how intently it is bent upon sensible things that are without it, may be conjectured from this one fact, that it is so greedy of sensible light, that if any one through carelessness, or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the possible consequences, place a light at nighttime where an infant is lying down, on that side to which the eyes of the child so lying down can be bent, but its neck cannot be turned, the gaze of that child will be so fixed in that direction, that we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> some to have come to squint by this means, in that the eyes retained that form which habit in some way impressed upon them while tender and soft.  In the case, too, of the other bodily senses, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of infants, as far as their age permits, so narrow themselves as it were, and are bent upon them, that they either vehemently detest or vehemently desire that only which offends or allures through the flesh, but do not think of their own inward self, nor can be made to do so by admonition; because they do not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the signs that express admonition, whereof words are the chief, of which as of other things they are wholly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. And that it is one thing not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> oneself, another not to think of oneself, we have shown already in the same book. </p>

<p>8. But let us pass by the infantine age, since we cannot question it as to what goes on within itself, while we have ourselves pretty well forgotten it. Let it suffice only for us hence to be certain, that when man has come to be able to think of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and to find out what is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he will find it nowhere else but in himself. And he will find, not what he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but that of which he did not think. For what do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, if we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is in our own mind; when we can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing at all of what we do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, unless by the mind?</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; How a Kind of Trinity Exists in the Mind Thinking of Itself. What is the Part of Thought in This Trinity.</h2>

<p>The function of thought, however, is so great, that not even the mind itself can, so to say, place itself in its own sight, except when it thinks of itself; and hence it is so far the case, that nothing is in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, except that which is being thought of, that not even the mind itself, whereby we think whatever we do think, can be in its own sight otherwise than by thinking of itself. But in <em>what way</em> it is not in its own sight when it is not thinking of itself, while it can never <em>be</em> without itself, as though itself were one thing, and the sight of itself another, it is not in my power to discover. For this is not unreasonably said of the eye of the body; for the eye itself of the body is fixed in its own proper place in the body, but its sight extends to things external to itself, and reaches even to the stars. And the eye is not in its own sight, since it does not look at itself, unless by means of a mirror, as is said above;  a thing that certainly does not happen when the mind places itself in its own sight by thinking of itself. Does it then see one part of itself by means of another part of itself, when it looks at itself in thought, as we look at some of our members, which can be in our sight, with other also of our members, <em>viz</em>. with our eyes? What can be said or thought more absurd? For by what is the mind removed, except by itself? Or where is it placed so as to be in its own sight, except before itself? Therefore it will not be there, where it was, when it was not in its own sight; because it has been put down in one place, after being taken away from another. But if it migrated in order to be beheld, where will it remain in order to behold? Is it as it were doubled, so as to be in this and in that place at the same time, <em>viz.</em> both where it can behold, and where it can be beheld; that in itself it may be beholding, and before itself beheld? If we ask the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it will tell us nothing of the sort since it is but feigned images of bodily objects of which we conceive when we conceive thus; and that the mind is not such, is very certain to the few minds by which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> on such a subject can be inquired. It appears, therefore, that the beholding of the mind is something pertaining to its nature, and is recalled to that nature when it conceives of itself, not as if by moving through space, but by an incorporeal conversion; but when it is not conceiving of itself, it appears that it is not indeed in its own sight, nor is its own perception formed from it, but yet that it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> itself as though it were to itself a remembrance of itself. Like one who is skilled in many branches of learning: the things which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> are contained in his memory, but nothing thereof is in the sight of his mind except that of which he is conceiving; while all the rest are stored up in a kind of secret <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is called memory. The trinity, then, which we were setting forth, was constituted in this way: first, we placed in the memory the object by which the perception of the percipient was formed; next, the conformation, or as it were the image which is impressed thereby; lastly, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> or will as that which combines the two. When the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, then, beholds itself in conception, it understands and cognizes itself; it begets, therefore, this its own understanding and cognition. For an incorporeal thing is understood when it is beheld, and is cognized when understood. Yet certainly the mind does not so beget this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of itself, when it beholds itself as understood by conception, as though it had before been unknown to itself; but it was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to itself, in the way in which things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> which are contained in the memory, but of which one is not thinking; since we say that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> letters even when he is thinking of something else, and not of letters. And these two, the begetter and the begotten, are coupled together by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, as by a third, which is nothing else than will, seeking or holding fast the enjoyment of something. We held, therefore, that a trinity of the mind is to be intimated also by these three terms, memory, intelligence, will.</p>

<p>9. But since the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as we said near the end of the same tenth book, always remembers itself, and always understands and loves itself, although it does not always think of itself as distinguished from those things which are not itself; we must inquire in what way understanding (<em>intellectus</em>) belongs to conception, while the notion (<em>notitia</em>) of each thing that is in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, even when one is not thinking of it, is said to belong only to the memory. For if this is so, then the mind had not these three things: <em>viz</em>. the remembrance, the understanding, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of itself; but it only remembered itself, and afterwards, when it began to think of itself, then it understood and loved itself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; The Thing is Made Plain by an Example. In What Way the Matter is Handled in Order to Help the Reader.</h2>

<p>Wherefore let us consider more carefully that example which we have adduced, wherein it was shown that not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> a thing is different from not thinking [conceiving] of it; and that it may so happen that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> something of which he is not thinking, when he is thinking of something else, not of that. When any one, then, who is skilled in two or more branches of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is thinking of one of them, though he is not thinking of the other or others, yet he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them. But can we rightly say, This musician certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> music, but he does not now understand it, because he is not thinking of it; but he does now understand geometry, for of that he is now thinking? Such an assertion, as far as appears, is absurd. What, again, if we were to say, This musician certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> music, but he does not now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it, while he is not now thinking of it; but he does now <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> geometry, because of that he is now thinking&mdash;is not this similarly absurd? But we say quite correctly, This person whom you perceive disputing about geometry is also a perfect musician, for he both remembers music, and understands, and loves it; but although he both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and loves it, he is not now thinking of it, since he is thinking of geometry, of which he is disputing. And hence we are warned that we have a kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of certain things stored up in the recesses of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and that this, when it is thought of, as it were, steps forth in public, and is placed as if openly in the sight of the mind; for then the mind itself finds that it both remembers, and understands, and loves itself, even although it was not thinking of itself, when it was thinking of something else. But in the case of that of which we have not thought for a long time, and cannot think of it unless reminded; that, if the phrase is allowable, in some wonderful way I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how, we do not <em><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a></em> that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. In short, it is rightly said by him who reminds, to him whom he reminds, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, but you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it; I will remind you, and you will find that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what you had thought you did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Books, too, lead to the same results, <em>viz</em>. those that are written upon subjects which the reader under the guidance of reason finds to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; not those subjects which he believes to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the narrator, as in the case of history; but those which he himself also finds to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, either of himself, or in that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself which is the light of the mind. But he who cannot contemplate these things, even when reminded, is too deeply buried in the darkness of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, through great blindness of heart and too wonderfully needs divine help, to be able to attain to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom.</p>

<p>10. For this reason I have wished to adduce some kind of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, be it what it might, respecting the act of conceiving, such as might serve to show in what way, out of the things contained in the memory, the mind's eye is informed in recollecting, and some such thing is begotten, when a man conceives, as was already in him when, before he conceived, he remembered; because it is easier to distinguish things that take place at successive times, and where the parent precedes the offspring by an interval of time. For if we refer ourselves to the inner memory of the mind by which it remembers itself, and to the inner understanding by which it understands itself, and to the inner will by which it loves itself, where these three always are together, and always have been together since they began to be at all, whether they were being thought of or not; the image of this trinity will indeed appear to pertain even to the memory alone; but because in this case a word cannot be without a thought (for we <em> think</em> all that we say, even if it be said by that inner word which belongs to no separate language), this image is rather to be discerned in these three things, <em>viz.</em> memory, intelligence, will. And I mean now by intelligence that by which we understand in thought, that is, when our thought is formed by the finding of those things, which had been at hand to the memory but were not being thought of; and I mean that will, or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, or preference which combines this offspring and parent, and is in some way common to both. Hence it was that I tried also, <em>viz.</em> in the eleventh book, to lead on the slowness of readers by means of outward sensible things which are seen by the eyes of the flesh; and that I then proceeded to enter with them upon that power of the inner man whereby he reasons of things temporal, deferring the consideration of that which dominates as the higher power, by which he contemplates things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. And I discussed this in two books, distinguishing the two in the twelfth, the one of them being higher and the other lower, and that the lower ought to be subject to the higher; and in the thirteenth I discussed, with what <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and brevity I could, the office of the lower, in which the wholesome <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> is contained, in order that we may so act in this temporal life as to attain that which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; since, indeed, I have cursorily included in a single book a subject so manifold and copious, and one so well known by the many and great arguments of many and great men, while manifesting that a trinity exists also in it, but not yet one that can be called an image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; The Trinity Which is the Image of God is Now to Be Sought in the Noblest Part of the Mind.</h2>

<p>11. But we have come now to that argument in which we have undertaken to consider the noblest part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, by which it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> or can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that we may find in it the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For although the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is not of the same nature with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet the image of that nature than which none is better, is to be sought and found in us, in that than which our nature also has nothing better. But the mind must first be considered as it is in itself, before it becomes partaker of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and His image must be found in it. For, as we have said, although worn out and defaced by losing the participation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet the image of God still remains.  For it is His image in this very point, that it is capable of Him, and can be partaker of Him; which so great good is only made possible by its being His image. Well, then, the mind remembers, understands, loves itself; if we discern this, we discern a trinity, not yet indeed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but now at last an image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The memory does not receive from without that which it is to hold; nor does the understanding find without that which it is to regard, as the eye of the body does; nor has will joined these two from without, as it joins the form of the bodily object and that which is thence wrought in the vision of the beholder; nor has conception, in being turned to it, found an image of a thing seen without, which has been somehow seized and laid up in the memory, whence the intuition of him that recollects has been formed, will as a third joining the two: as we showed to take place in those trinities which were discovered in things corporeal, or which were somehow drawn within from bodily objects by the bodily sense; of all which we have discoursed in the eleventh book.  Nor, again, as it took place, or appeared to do so, when we went on further to discuss that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which had its place now in the workings of the inner man, and which was to be distinguished from wisdom; of which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the subject-matter was, as it were, adventitious to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and either was brought there by historical information&mdash;as <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and words, which are performed in time and pass away, or which again are established in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things in their own times and places&mdash;or arises in the man himself not being there before, whether on the information of others, or by his own thinking&mdash;as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which we commended at length in the thirteenth book, or as the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, by which, if they are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, one so lives well in this mortality as to live blessedly in that <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> promises. These and other things of the kind have their proper order in time, and in that order we discerned more easily a trinity of memory, sight, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For some of such things anticipate the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of learners. For they are knowable also before they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and beget in the learner a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of themselves. And they either exist in their own proper places, or have happened in time past; although things that are past do not themselves exist, but only certain signs of them as past, the sight or hearing of which makes it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that they have been and have passed away. And these signs are either situate in the places themselves, as <em>e.g.</em> monuments of the dead or the like; or exist in written books worthy of credit, as is all history that is of weight and approved authority; or are in the minds of those who already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them; since what is already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them is knowable certainly to others also, whose <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> it has anticipated, and who are able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it on the information of those who do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it. And all these things, when they are learned, produce a certain kind of trinity, <em>viz.</em> by their own proper species, which was knowable also before it was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and by the application to this of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the learner, which then begins to exist when he learns them, and by will as a third which combines both; and when they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, yet another trinity is produced in the recollecting of them, and this now inwardly in the mind itself, from those images which, when they were learned, were impressed upon the memory, and from the informing of the thought when the look has been turned upon these by recollection, and from the will which as a third combines these two. But those things which arise in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, not having been there before, as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and other things of that kind, although they appear to be adventitious, since they are implanted by teaching, yet are not situate without or transacted without, as are those things which are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; but began to be altogether within in the mind itself. For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not that which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but that by which it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; and the former is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, the latter seen. Nevertheless, because it began to be in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which was a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> also before these things began to be in it, it seems to be somewhat adventitious, and will be reckoned among things past, when sight shall have succeeded, and itself shall have ceased to be. And it makes now by its presence, retained as it is, and beheld, and loved, a different trinity from that which it will then make by means of some trace of itself, which in passing it will have left in the memory: as has been already said above.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; Whether Justice and the Other Virtues Cease to Exist in the Future Life.</h2>

<p>12. There is, however, some question raised, whether the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> likewise by which one lives well in this present mortality, seeing that they themselves begin also to be in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which was a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> none the less when it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before without them, cease also to exist at that time when they have brought us to things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. For some have thought that they will cease, and in the case of three&mdash; <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>&mdash; such an assertion seems to have something in it; but <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and will rather then be made perfect in us than cease to be. Yet Tullius, the great author of eloquence, when arguing in the dialogue <em>Hortensius</em>, says of all four: <q>If we were allowed, when we migrated from this life, to live forever in the islands of the blessed, as fables tell, what need were there of eloquence when there would be no trials, or what need, indeed, of the very <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> themselves? For we should not need <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> when nothing of either toil or danger was proposed to us; nor <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, when there was nothing of anybody else's to be <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a>; nor <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, to govern lasts that would not exist; nor, indeed, should we need <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, when there was no choice offered between good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. We should be blessed, therefore, solely by learning and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> nature, by which alone also the life of the gods is praiseworthy. And hence we may perceive that everything else is a matter of necessity, but this is one of free choice.</q> This great orator, then, when proclaiming the excellence of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, going over again all that he had learned from <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and excellently and pleasantly explaining it, has affirmed all four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to be necessary in this life only, which we see to be full of troubles and mistakes; but not one of them when we shall have migrated from this life, if we are permitted to live there where is a blessed life; but that blessed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are blessed only in learning and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, <em>i.e.</em> in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of nature, than which nothing is better and more lovable. It is that nature which created and appointed all other natures. And if it belongs to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to be subject to the government of this nature then <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is certainly <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; nor will it cease to be in that blessedness, but will be such and so great that it cannot be more perfect or greater. Perhaps, too, the other three <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>&mdash; <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> although no longer with any risk of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> without the vexation of bearing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> without the thwarting of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>&mdash; will exist in that blessedness: so that it may be the part of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to prefer or equal no good thing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, to cleave to Him most steadfastly; and of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, to be pleased by no harmful defect. But that which <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is now concerned with in helping the wretched, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in guarding against treachery, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in bearing troubles patiently, and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> in controlling <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> pleasures, will not exist there, where there will be no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> at all. And hence those acts of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are necessary to this mortal life, like the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to which they are to be referred, will be reckoned among things past; and they make now a different trinity, while we hold, look at, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them as present, from that which they will then make, when we shall discover them not to be, but to have been, by certain traces of them which they will have left in passing in the memory; since then, too, there will be a trinity, when that trace, be it of what sort it may, shall be retained in the memory, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> recognized, and then these two be joined by will as a third.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; How a Trinity is Produced by the Mind Remembering, Understanding, and Loving Itself.</h2>

<p>13. In the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all these temporal things which we have mentioned, there are some knowable things which precede the acquisition of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them by an interval of time, as in the case of those sensible objects which were already real before they were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, or of all those things that are learned through history; but some things begin to be at the same time with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> of them&mdash;just as, if any visible object, which did not exist before at all, were to rise up before our eyes, certainly it does not precede our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it; or if there be any sound made where there is some one to hear, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the sound and the hearing that sound begin and end simultaneously. Yet none the less, whether preceding in time or beginning to exist simultaneously, knowable things generate knowledge,  and are not generated by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But when <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> has come to pass, whenever the things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and laid up in memory are reviewed by recollection, who does not see that the retaining them in the memory is prior in time to the sight of them in recollection, and to the uniting of the two things by will as a third? In the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, howver, it is not so. For the mind is not adventitious to itself, as though there came to itself already existing, that same self not already existing, from somewhere else, or did not indeed come from somewhere else, but that in the mind itself already existing, there was born that same mind not already existing; just as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which before was not, arises in the mind which already was. Nor does the mind see itself, as it were, set up in its own memory by recollection subsequently to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> of itself, as though it was not there before it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> itself; whereas,doubtless, from the time when it began to be, it has never ceased to remember, to understand, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself, as we have already shown. And hence, when it is turned to itself by thought, there arises a trinity, in which now at length we can discern also a word; since it is formed from thought itself, will uniting both. Here, then, we may recognize, more than we have hitherto done, the image of which we are in search.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; Whether Memory is Also of Things Present.</h2>

<p>14. But some one will say, That is not memory by which the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is ever present to itself, is affirmed to remember itself; for memory is of things past, not of things present. For there are some, and among them Cicero, who, in treating of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, have divided <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> into these three&mdash; memory, understanding, forethought: to wit, assigning memory to things past, understanding to things present, forethought to things future; which last is certain only in the case of those who are prescient of the future; and this is no gift of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, unless it be granted from above, as to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. And hence the book of Wisdom, speaking of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <q>The thoughts of mortals,</q> it says, <q>are fearful, and our forethought uncertain.</q>  But memory of things past, and understanding of things present, are certain: certain, I mean, respecting things incorporeal, which are present; for things corporeal are present to the sight of the corporeal eyes. But let any one who denies that there is any memory of things present, attend to the language used even in profane literature, where exactness of words was more looked for than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of things. <q>Nor did Ulysses suffer such things, nor did the Ithacan forget himself in so great a peril.</q>  For when Virgil said that Ulysses did not forget himself, what else did he mean, except that he remembered himself? And since he was present to himself, he could not possibly remember himself, unless memory pertained to things present. And, therefore, as that is called memory in things past which makes it possible to recall and remember them; so in a thing present, as the mind is to itself, that is not unreasonably to be called memory, which makes the mind at hand to itself, so that it can be understood by its own thought, and then both be joined together by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of itself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; The Trinity in the Mind is the Image of God, in that It Remembers, Understands, and Loves God, Which to Do is Wisdom.</h2>

<p>15. This trinity, then, of the mind is not therefore the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because the mind remembers itself, and understands and loves itself; but because it can also remember, understand, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him by whom it was made. And in so doing it is made wise itself. But if it does not do so, even when it remembers, understands, and loves itself, then it is foolish. Let it then remember its <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, after whose image it is made, and let it understand and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him. Or to say the same thing more briefly, let it worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is not made, by whom because itself was made, it is capable and can be partaker of Him; wherefore it is written, <q>Behold, the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is wisdom.</q>  And then it will be wise, not by its own light, but by participation of that supreme Light; and wherein it is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, therein shall reign in blessedness. For this wisdom of man is so called, in that it is also of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For then it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom; for if it is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, it is vain. Yet not so of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as is that wherewith God is wise. For He is not wise by partaking of Himself, as the mind is by partaking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But as we call it the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not only when we speak of that by which He Himself is righteous, but also of that which He gives to man when He justifies the ungodly, which latter righteousness the apostle commending, says of some, that <q>not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and going about to establish their own righteousness,they are not subject to the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q>  so also it may be said of some, that not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the wisdom of God and going about to establish their own wisdom, they are not subject to the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>16. There is, then, a nature not made, which made all other natures, great and small, and is without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> more excellent than those which it has made, and therefore also than that of which we are speaking; <em>viz.</em> than the rational and intellectual nature, which is the mind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, made after the image of Him who made it. And that nature, more excellent than the rest, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And indeed <q>He is not far from every one of us,</q> as the apostle says, who adds, <q>For in Him we live, and are moved, and have our being.</q>  And if this were said in respect to the body, it might be understood even of this corporeal world; for in it too in respect to the body, we live, and are moved, and have our being. And therefore it ought to be taken in a more excellent way, and one that is spiritual, not visible, in respect to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is made after His image. For what is there that is not in Him, of whom it is divinely written, <q>For of Him, and through Him, and in Him, are all things</q>?  If, then, all things are in Him, in whom can any possibly live that do live, or be moved that are moved, except in Him in whom they are? Yet all are not with Him in that way in which it is said to Him, <q>I am continually with You.</q>  Nor is He with all in that way in which we say, The Lord be with you. And so it is the special wretchedness of man not to be with Him, without whom he cannot be. For, beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, he is not without Him in whom he is; and yet if he does not remember, and understand, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, he is not with Him. And when any one absolutely forgets a thing, certainly it is impossible even to remind him of it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; How Any One Can Forget and Remember God.</h2>

<p>17. Let us take an instance for the purpose from visible things. Somebody whom you do not recognize, says to you, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me; and in order to remind you, tells you where, when, and how he became <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you; and if, after the mention of every sign by which you might be recalled to remembrance, you still do not recognize him, then you have so come to forget, as that the whole of that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is altogether blotted out of your mind; and nothing else remains, but that you take his word for it who tells you that you once <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him; or do not even do that, if you do not think the person who speaks to you to be worthy of credit. But if you do remember him, then no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> you return to your own memory, and find in it that which had not been altogether blotted out by forgetfulness. Let us return to that which led us to adduce this instance from the intercourse of men. Among other things, the 9th Psalm says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall be turned into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and all the nations. that forget <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q>  and again the 22d Psalm, <q>All the ends of the world shall be reminded, and turned unto the Lord.</q>  These nations, then, will not so have forgotten God as to be unable to remember Him when reminded of Him; yet, by forgetting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as though forgetting their own life, they had been turned into death, <em>i.e.</em> into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.  But when reminded they are turned to the Lord, as though coming to life again by remembering their proper life which they had forgotten. It is read also in the 94th Psalm, <q>Perceive now, you who are unwise among the people; and you fools, when will you be wise? He that planted the ear, shall He not hear?</q> etc.  For this is spoken to those, who said vain things concerning God through not understanding Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; The Mind Loves God in Rightly Loving Itself; And If It Love Not God, It Must Be Said to Hate Itself. Even a Weak and Erring Mind is Always Strong in Remembering, Understanding, and Loving Itself. Let It Be Turned to God, that It May Be Blessed by Remembering, Understanding, and Loving Him.</h2>

<p>18. But there are yet more testimonies in the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For in it, those other two [namely, memory and understanding] are understood by consequence, inasmuch as no one loves that which he does not remember, or of which he is wholly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. And hence is that well known and primary commandment, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, then, is so constituted, that at no time does it not remember, and understand, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself. But since he who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> any one is anxious to injure him, not undeservedly is the mind of man also said to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> itself when it injures itself. For it wills ill to itself through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, in that it does not think that what it wills is prejudicial to it; but it none the less does will ill to itself, when it wills what would be prejudicial to it. And hence it is written, <q>He that loves iniquity, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q>  He, therefore, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> himself, loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but he who does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even if he does <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> himself&mdash;a thing implanted in him by nature,&mdash; yet is not unsuitably said to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> himself, inasmuch as he does that which is adverse to himself, and assails himself as though he were his own enemy. And this is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> a terrible delusion, that whereas all will to profit themselves, many do nothing but that which is most pernicious to themselves. When the poet was describing a like disease of dumb animals, <q>May the gods,</q> says he, <q>grant better things to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and assign that delusion to enemies. They were rending with bare teeth their own torn limbs.</q>  Since it was a disease of the body he was speaking of, why has he called it a delusion, unless because, while nature inclines every animal to take all the care it can of itself, that disease was such that those animals rent those very limbs of theirs which they desired should be safe and sound? But when the mind loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by consequence, as has been said remembers and understands Him, then it is rightly enjoined also to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> its neighbor as itself; for it has now come to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself rightly and not perversely when it loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by partaking of whom that image not only exists, but is also renewed so as to be no longer old, and restored so as to be no longer defaced, and beatified so as to be no longer unhappy. For although it so <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself, that, supposing the alternative to be proposed to it, it would lose all things which it loves less than itself rather than perish; still, by abandoning Him who is above it, in dependence upon whom alone it could guard its own strength, and enjoy Him as its light, to whom it is sung in the Psalm, <q>I will guard my strength in dependence upon You,</q>  and again, <q>Draw near to Him, and be enlightened,</q> &mdash; it has been made so weak and so dark, that it has fallen away unhappily from itself too, to those things that are not what itself is, and which are beneath itself, by affections that it cannot conquer, and delusions from which it sees no way to return. And hence, when by God's mercy now penitent, it cries out in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <q>My strength fails me; as for the light of my eyes, it also is gone from me.</q> </p>

<p>19. Yet, in the midst of these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of weakness and delusion, great as they are, it could not lose its natural memory, understanding and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of itself. And therefore what I quoted above  can be rightly said, <q>Although man walks in an image, surely he is disquieted in vain: he heaps up treasures, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not who shall gather them.</q>  For why does he heap up treasures, unless because his strength has deserted him, through which he would have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so lack nothing? And why cannot he tell for whom he shall gather them, unless because the light of his eyes is taken from him? And so he does not see what the Truth says, <q>You fool, this night your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be required of you. Then whose shall those things be which you have provided?</q>  Yet because even such a man walks in an image, and the man's mind has remembrance, understanding, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of itself; if it were made plain to it that it could not have both, while it was permitted to choose one and lose the other, <em>viz</em>. either the treasures it has heaped up, or the mind; who is so utterly without <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as to prefer to have the treasures rather than the mind? For treasures commonly are able to subvert the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but the mind that is not subverted by treasures can live more easily and unencumberedly without any treasures. But who will be able to possess treasures unless it be by means of the mind? For if an infant, born as rich as you please, although lord of everything that is rightfully his, yet possesses nothing if his mind be unconscious, how can any one possibly possess anything whose mind is wholly lost? But why say of treasures, that anybody, if the choice be given him, prefers going without them to going without a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; when there is no one that prefers, nay, no one that compares them, to those lights of the body, by which not one man only here and there, as in the case of gold, but every man, possesses the very heaven? For every one possesses by the eyes of the body whatever he gladly sees. Who then is there, who, if he could not keep both, but must lose one, would not rather lose his treasures than his eyes? And yet if it were put to him on the same condition, whether he would rather lose eyes than <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, who is there with a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that does not see that he would rather lose the former than the latter? For a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> without the eyes of the flesh is still <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but the eyes of the flesh without a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> are bestial. And who would not rather be a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, even though blind in fleshly sight, than a beast that can see?</p>

<p>20. I have said thus much, that even those who are slower of understanding, to whose eyes or ears this book may come, might be admonished, however briefly, how greatly even a weak and erring mind loves itself, in wrongly loving and pursuing things beneath itself. Now it could not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself if it were altogether <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of itself, <em>i.e.</em> if it did not remember itself, nor understand itself by which image of God within itself it has such power as to be able to cleave to Him whose image it is. For it is so reckoned in the order, not of place, but of natures, as that there is none above it save Him. When, finally, it shall altogether cleave to Him, then it will be one spirit, as the apostle testifies, saying, <q>But he who cleaves to the Lord is one spirit.</q>  And this by its drawing near to partake of His nature, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and blessedness, yet not by His increasing in His own nature, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and blessedness. In that nature, then, when it happily has cleaved to it, it will live unchangeably, and will see as unchangeable all that it does see. Then, as <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> promises, <q>His desire will be satisfied with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things,</q>  <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things unchangeable&mdash;the very Trinity itself, its own <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose image it is. And that it may not ever thenceforward suffer wrong, it will be in the hidden place of His presence,  filled with so great fullness of Him, that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> thenceforth will never delight it. But now, when it sees itself, it sees something not unchangeable.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; Although the Soul Hopes for Blessedness, Yet It Does Not Remember Lost Blessedness, But Remembers God and the Rules of Righteousness. The Unchangeable Rules of Right Living are Known Even to the Ungodly.</h2>

<p>21. And of this certainly it feels no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that it is wretched, and longs to be blessed nor can it hope for the possibility of this on any other ground than its own changeableness for if it were not changeable, then, as it could not become wretched after being blessed, so neither could it become blessed after being wretched. And what could have made it wretched under an <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> and good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except its own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the righteousness of its Lord? And what will make it blessed, unless its own merit, and its Lord's reward? But its merit, too, is His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whose reward will be its blessedness; for it cannot give itself the righteousness it has lost, and so has not. For this it received when man was created, and assuredly lost it by sinning. Therefore it receives righteousness, that on account of this it may deserve to receive blessedness; and hence the apostle <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> says to it, when beginning to be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> as it were of its own good, <q>For what have you that you did not receive? Now if you received it, why do you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as if you had not received it?</q>  But when it rightly remembers its own Lord, having received His Spirit, then, because it is so taught by an inward teaching, it feels wholly that it cannot rise save by His affection freely given, nor has been able to fall save by its own defection freely chosen. Certainly it does not remember its own blessedness; since that has been, but is not, and it has utterly forgotten it, and therefore cannot even be reminded of it.  But it believes what the trustworthy Scriptures of its God tell of that blessedness, which were written by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and tell of the blessedness of Paradise, and hand down to us historical information of that first both good and ill of man. And it remembers the Lord its <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for He always is, nor has been and is not, nor is but has not been; but as He never will not be, so He never was not. And He is whole everywhere. And hence it both lives, and is moved, and is in Him;  and so it can remember Him. Not because it recollects the having <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> or anywhere else before the life of this present body, or when it was first made in order to be implanted in this body; for it remembers nothing at all of all this. Whatever there is of this, it has been blotted out by forgetfulness. But it is reminded, that it may be turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as though to that light by which it was in some way touched, even when turned away from Him. For hence it is that even the ungodly think of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and rightly blame and rightly praise many things in the morals of men. And by what rules do they thus judge, except by those wherein they see how men ought to live, even though they themselves do not so live? And where do they see these rules? For they do not see them in their own [moral] nature; since no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> these things are to be seen by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and their minds are confessedly changeable, but these rules are seen as unchangeable by him who can see them at all; nor yet in the character of their own <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, since these rules are rules of righteousness, and their minds are confessedly unrighteous. Where indeed are these rules written, wherein even the unrighteous recognizes what is righteous, wherein he discerns that he ought to have what he himself has not? Where, then, are they written, unless in the book of that Light which is called Truth? Whence every righteous law is copied and transferred (not by migrating to it, but by being as it were impressed upon it) to the heart of the man that works righteousness; as the impression from a ring passes into the wax, yet does not leave the ring. But he who works not, and yet sees how he ought to work, he is the man that is turned away from that light, which yet touches him. But he who does not even see how he ought to live, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> indeed with more excuse, because he is not a transgressor of a law that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; but even he too is just touched sometimes by the splendor of the everywhere present <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when upon admonition he confesses.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; How the Image of God is Formed Anew in Man.</h2>

<p>22. But those who, by being reminded, are turned to the Lord from that deformity whereby they were through worldly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> conformed to this world, are formed anew from the world, when they hearken to the apostle, saying, <q>Be not conformed to this world, but be formed again in the renewing of your mind;</q>  that that image may begin to be formed again by Him by whom it had been formed at first. For that image cannot form itself again, as it could deform itself. He says again elsewhere: <q>Be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and put ye on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.</q>  That which is meant by <q>created after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> is expressed in another place by <q>after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  But it lost righteousness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> by sinning, through which that image became defaced and tarnished; and this it recovers when it is formed again and renewed. But when he says, <q>In the spirit of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,</q> he does not intend to be understood of two things, as though mind were one, and the spirit of the mind another; but he speaks thus, because all mind is spirit, but all spirit is not mind. For there is a Spirit also that is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  which cannot be renewed, because it cannot grow old. And we speak also of a spirit in man distinct from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to which spirit belong the images that are formed after the likeness of bodies; and of this the apostle speaks to the Corinthians, where he says, <q>But if I shall have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> with a tongue, my spirit <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, but my understanding is unfruitful.</q>  For he speaks thus, when that which is said is not understood; since it cannot even be said, unless the images of the corporeal articulate sounds anticipate the oral sound by the thought of the spirit. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man is also called spirit, whence are the words in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>And He bowed His head, and gave up His spirit;</q>  by which the death of the body, through the spirit's leaving it, is signified. We speak also of the spirit of a beast, as it is expressly written in the book of Solomon called Ecclesiastes; <q>Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the spirit of man that goes upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to the earth?</q>  It is written too in Genesis, where it is said that by the deluge all flesh died which <q>had in it the spirit of life.</q>  We speak also of the spirit, meaning the wind, a thing most manifestly corporeal; whence is that in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <q>Fire and hail, snow and ice, the spirit of the storm.</q>  Since spirit, then, is a word of so many meanings, the apostle intended to express by <q>the spirit of the mind</q> that spirit which is called the mind. As the same apostle also, when he says, <q>In putting off the body of the flesh,</q>  certainly did not intend two things, as though flesh were one, and the body of the flesh another; but because body is the name of many things that have no flesh (for besides the flesh, there are many bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial), he expressed by the body of the flesh that body which is flesh. In like manner, therefore, by the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that spirit which is mind. Elsewhere, too, he has even more plainly called it an image, while enforcing the same thing in other words. <q>Do you,</q> he says, <q>putting off the old man with his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, put on the new man, which is renewed in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God after the image of Him that created him.</q>  Where the one passage reads, <q>Put on the new man, which is created after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> the other has, <q>Put on the new man, which is renewed after the image of Him that created him.</q></p>

<p>In the one place he says, <q>After <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> in the other, <q>After the image of Him that created him.</q> But instead of saying, as in the former passages <q>In righteousness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>,</q> he has put in the latter, <q>In the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> This renewal, then, and forming again of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, is wrought either after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it is said to be after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that it may not be supposed to be after another creature; and to be after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that this renewing may be understood to take place in that wherein is the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>i.e.</em> in the mind. Just as we say, that he who has departed from the body a faithful and righteous man, is dead after the body, not after the spirit. For what do we mean by dead after the body, unless as to the body or in the body, and not dead as to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Or if we want to say he is handsome after the body, or strong after the body, not after the mind; what else is this, than that he is handsome or strong in body, not in mind? And the same is the case with numberless other instances. Let us not therefore so understand the words, <q>After the image of Him that created him,</q> as though it were a different image after which he is renewed, and not the very same which is itself renewed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.&mdash; How the Image of God in the Mind is Renewed Until the Likeness of God is Perfected in It in Blessedness.</h2>

<p>23. Certainly this renewal does not take place in the single moment of conversion itself, as that renewal in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> takes place in a single moment by the remission of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for not one, be it ever so small, remains unremitted. But as it is one thing to be free from fever, and another to grow strong again from the infirmity which the fever produced; and one thing again to pluck out of the body a weapon thrust into it, and another to heal the wound thereby made by a prosperous cure; so the first cure is to remove the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of infirmity, and this is wrought by the forgiving of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but the second cure is to heal the infirmity itself, and this takes place gradually by making progress in the renewal of that image: which two things are plainly shown in the Psalm, where we read, <q>Who forgives all your iniquities,</q> which takes place in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and then follows, <q>and heals all your infirmities;</q>  and this takes place by daily additions, while this image is being renewed.  And the apostle has spoken of this most expressly, saying, <q>And though our outward man perish, yet the inner man is renewed day by day.</q>  And <q>it is renewed in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>i.e.</em> in righteousness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>,</q> according to the testimonies of the apostle cited a little before. He, then, who is day by day renewed by making progress in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in righteousness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, transfers his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> from things temporal to things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, from things visible to things intelligible, from things carnal to things spiritual; and diligently perseveres in bridling and lessening his desire for the former, and in binding himself by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the latter. And he does this in proportion as he is helped by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is the sentence of God Himself, <q>Without me you can do nothing.</q>  And when the last day of life shall have found any one holding fast <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Mediator in such progress and growth as this, he will be welcomed by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, to be led to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom he has worshipped, and to be made perfect by Him; and so will receive in the end of the world an incorruptible body, in order not to punishment, but to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For the likeness of God will then be perfected in this image, when the sight of God shall be perfected. And of this the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> speaks: <q>Now we see through a glass, in an enigma, but then face to face.</q>  And again: <q>But we with open face, beholding as in a glass the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, even as by the spirit of the Lord.</q>  And this is what happens from day to day in those that make good progress.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; Whether the Sentence of John is to Be Understood of Our Future Likeness with the Son of God in the Immortality Itself Also of the Body.</h2>

<p>24. But the Apostle John says, <q>Beloved, now are we the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.</q>  Hence it appears, that the full likeness of God is to take place in that image of God at that time when it shall receive the full sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And yet this may also possibly seem to be said by the Apostle John of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the body. For we shall be like to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this too, but only to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because He only in the Trinity took a body, in which He died and rose again, and which He carried with Him to heaven above. For this, too, is called an image of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, in which we shall have, as He has, an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> body, being conformed in this respect not to the image of the Father or of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but only of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because of Him alone is it read and received by a sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that <q>the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>.</q>  And for this reason the apostle says, <q>Whom He did foreknow, He also did <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinate</a> to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> among many brethren.</q>  <q>The <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a></q> certainly <q>from the dead,</q>  according  to the same apostle; by which death His flesh was sown in dishonor, and rose again in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. According to this image of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, to which we are conformed in the body by <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, we also do that of which the same apostle speaks, <q>As we have borne the image of the earthy, so shall we also bear the image of the heavenly;</q>  to wit, that we who are mortal after Adam, may hold by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and a sure and certain hope, that we shall be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> after Christ. For so can we now bear the same image, not yet in sight, but in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; not yet in fact, but in hope. For the apostle, when he said this, was speaking of the resurrection of the body.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; John is Rather to Be Understood of Our Perfect Likeness with the Trinity in Life Eternal. Wisdom is Perfected in Happiness.</h2>

<p>25. But in respect to that image indeed, of which it is said, <q>Let us make man after our image and likeness,</q>  we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>&mdash;and, after the utmost search we have been able to make, understand&mdash;that man was made after the image of the Trinity, because it is not said, After my, or After your image. And therefore that place too of the Apostle John must be understood rather according to this image, when he says, <q>We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is;</q> because he spoke too of Him of whom he had said, <q>We are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  And the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the flesh will be perfected in that moment of the resurrection, of which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says, <q>In the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</q>  For in that very twinkling of an eye, before the judgment, the spiritual body shall rise again in power, in incorruption, in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which is now sown a natural body in weakness, in corruption, in dishonor. But the image which is renewed in the spirit of the mind in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not outwardly, but inwardly, from day to day, shall be perfected by that sight itself; which then after the judgment shall be face to face, but now makes progress as through a glass in an enigma.  And we must understand it to be said on account of this perfection, that <q>we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.</q> For this gift will be given to us at that time, when it shall have been said, <q>Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you.</q>  For then will the ungodly be taken away, so that he shall not see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord,  when those on the left hand shall go into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, while those on the right go into life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.  But <q>this is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life,</q> as the Truth tells us; <q>to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You,</q> He says, <q>the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> whom You have sent.</q> </p>

<p>26. This contemplative wisdom, which I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is properly called wisdom as distinct from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the sacred writings; but wisdom only of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which yet man has not except from Him, by partaking of whom a rational and intellectual mind can be made <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> wise&mdash;this contemplative wisdom, I say, it is that Cicero commends, in the end of the dialogue <em>Hortensius</em>, when he says: <q>While, then, we consider these things night and day, and sharpen our understanding, which is the eye of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, taking care that it be not ever dulled, that is, while we live in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; we, I say, in so doing, have great hope that, if, on the one hand, this sentiment and wisdom of ours is mortal and perishable, we shall still, when we have discharged our <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> offices, have a pleasant setting, and a not painful extinction, and as it were a rest from life: or if, on the other, as ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> thought&mdash;and those, too, the greatest and far the most celebrated&mdash;we have <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and divine, then must we needs think, that the more these shall have always kept in their own proper course, <em>i.e.</em> in reason and in the desire of inquiry, and the less they shall have mixed and entangled themselves in the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the more easy ascent and return they will have to heaven.</q> And then he says, adding this short sentence, and finishing his discourse by repeating it: <q>Wherefore, to end my discourse at last, if we wish either for a tranquil extinction, after living in the pursuit of these subjects, or if to migrate without delay from this present home to another in no little measure better, we must bestow all our labor and care upon these pursuits.</q> And here I marvel, that a man of such great ability should promise to men living in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, which makes man blessed by <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <q>a pleasant setting after the discharge of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> offices, if this our sentiment and wisdom is mortal and perishable;</q> as if that which we did not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, or rather which we fiercely <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, were then to die and come to nothing, so that its setting would be pleasant to us! But indeed he had not learned this from the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, whom he extols with great praise; but this sentiment is redolent of that New Academy, wherein it pleased him to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of even the plainest things. But from the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> that were greatest and far most celebrated, as he himself confesses, he had learned that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> are not unsuitably stirred up by the exhortation to be found in <q>their own proper course,</q> when the end of this life shall have come, <em>i.e.</em> <q>in reason and in the desire of inquiry,</q> and to mix and entangle themselves the less in the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in order that they may have an easier return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But that course which consists in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and investigation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not suffice for the wretched, <em>i.e.</em> for all mortals who have only this kind of reason, and are without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Mediator; as I have taken pains to prove, as much as I could, in former books of this work, especially in the fourth and thirteenth.</p>
