<h1>On the Trinity (Book XI)</h1>

<div class="stiki"><p>Book XI. The Faith is one, even as God is One; but the faiths of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are many (&sect;&sect; 1, 2). Hilary has now demonstrated the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about Christ, so that it cannot be denied; it is attested also by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> even in his own day (&sect; 3). The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> preach another, a created Christ; and in making Christ a creature they proclaim another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not a Father but a Creator (&sect; 4). The Son, as the Image, is of one nature with the Father; if He is inferior He is not the Image (&sect; 5). But the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> explain the oneness away by arguments from His condescension to our estate (&sect; 6), and, even after His Resurrection, plead that He confesses His inequality. They argue thus from <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse24">1 Cor. xv. 24-28</a>, a passage to which the rest of this book is devoted (&sect;&sect; 7, 8). But we must recognise the mysteriousness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, accepting the two sides of it, both clearly revealed though we cannot reconcile them (&sect; 9). They regard only one aspect; Hilary in reply proves once more that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is both born from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Himself God (&sect;&sect; 10-12). But at His Incarnation He began to have as Lord the God Who had been His Father <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> (&sect; 13), and when He said that He was ascending to <em>His God</em>, He spoke as when He calls us His brethren (&sect;&sect; 14, 15). Thus there are two senses in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the Father of Christ; and He Who is Father to Christ the Son is Lord to Christ the Servant (&sect;&sect; 16, 17). And it was to Him as Servant that the Psalmist said, <em>Your God has anointed You</em>, the words would have no meaning if addressed to Him as Son (&sect;&sect; 18, 19). It is through this lower nature that He is our Brother and God our Father, and He the Mediator (&sect; 20). But it is argued that His subjection at the last and the delivery of the kingdom to the Father is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of inequality. The passage must be taken as a whole (&sect;&sect; 21, 22). There are some truths which it is difficult for man to grasp, and if we misunderstand them we must not be ashamed to confess our <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> (&sect;&sect; 23, 24). In this passage the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> aid their case by changing the order of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> (&sect;&sect; 25-27). <em>The end </em>means a final and enduring state, not the coming to an end (&sect; 28), and though He delivers up the kingdom He does not cease to reign (&sect; 29). His subjection to the Father and the subjection of all things to Him is next considered; in one sense it is figurative language, in another it proves the unity of Father and Son. The subjection of the Son means His partaking in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father (&sect;&sect; 30-36). The Transfiguration shows the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Body; a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which the faithful shall share (&sect;&sect; 37, 38). The righteous are His kingdom, which He, as Man, shall deliver to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for <em>By man came also the resurrection of the dead </em>(&sect; 39). And at last God shall be all in all, humanity in Christ not being discarded, but <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> and received into the Godhead (&sect; 40). Christ, as well as St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, has foretold this (&sect;&sect; 41, 42). The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> misrepresentation of this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is mere folly (&sect; 43). Any rational explanation must assume that God's majesty cannot be augmented, even as it cannot be measured (&sect;&sect; 44, 45), while our reason is limited, and so contrasted with the Divine infinity. God cannot become greater than He was in becoming <em>All in all</em>. Father and Son, after as before, must Each be as He was (&sect;&sect; 46-48). All was done for us that we might be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, being conformed to the likeness of Him Who is the Image of the Father (&sect; 49).</p></div>

<p>1. The Apostle in his letter to the Ephesians, reviewing in its manifold aspects the full and perfect <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, mingles with other instructions in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God the following: <em>As ye also were called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, one God and Father of all, and through all, and in us all</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331224"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse4">Ephesians&nbsp;4:4-6</a></span> He does not leave us in the vague and misleading paths of an indefinite teaching, or abandon us to the shifting fancies of imagination, but limits the unimpeded license of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and desire by the appointment of restraining barriers. He gives us no opportunity to be wise beyond what he preached, but defines in exact and precise language the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fixed for all time, that there may be no excuse for instability of belief. He declares one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as he preaches one Lord, and pronounces one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as he declares one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of one Lord, that as there is one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of one Lord, so there may be one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in one Lord. And since the whole <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not only in one Lord, but also in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he completes the consummation of our hope by the confession of one God. The one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as they are of one Lord. Lord and God are each one, not by union of person but by distinction of properties: for, on the one hand, it is the property of Each to be one, whether of the Father in His Fatherhood, or of the Son in His Sonship, and on the other hand, that property of individuality, which Each possesses, constitutes for Each the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His union with the Other. Thus the one Lord Christ cannot take away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father His Lordship, or the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father deny to the one Lord Christ His Godhead. If, because God is one, Christ is not also by nature divine, then we cannot allow that the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> is Lord, because there is one Lord Christ: that is, on the supposition that by their oneness' is signified not the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, but an exclusive unity. So there is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of one Lord, as of one God.</p>

<p>2. But how can it be any longer one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if it does not steadfastly and sincerely confess one Lord and one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father: and how can the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is not one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> confess one Lord and one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father? Further, how can the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be one, when its preachers are so at variance? One comes teaching that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, being in the weakness of our nature, groaned with anguish when the nails pierced His hands, that He lost the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of His own power and nature, and shrank shuddering from the death which threatened Him. Another even denies the cardinal doctrine of the Generation and pronounces Him a creature. Another will call Him, but not think Him, God on the ground that religion allows us to speak of more Gods than One, but He, Whom we recognise as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must be conscious of sharing the divine nature.  Again, how can Christ the Lord be one, when some say that as God He feels no pain, others make Him weak and fearful: to some He is God in name, to others God in nature: to some the Son by Generation, to others the Son by appellation? And if this is so, how can <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father be one in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when to some He is Father by His authority, to others Father by generation, in the sense that God is Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>?</p>

<p>And yet, who will deny that whatever is not the one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at all? For in the one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> there is one Lord Christ, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is one. But the one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is not one in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the confession, as well as in name, unless He is Son, unless He is God , unless He is unchangeable, unless His Sonship and His Godhead have been <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> present in Him. He who preaches Christ other than He is, that is, other than Son and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, preaches another Christ. Nor is he in the one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, for in the teaching of the Apostle the one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of that one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in which the one Lord is Christ, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Who is also God.</p>

<p>3. Yet it cannot be denied that Christ was Christ. It cannot be that He was incognisable to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. The books of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have set their seal upon Him: the fullness  of the times, which waxes daily, witnesses of Him: by the working of wonders the tombs of Apostles and Martyrs proclaim Him: the power of His name reveals Him: the unclean spirits confess Him, and the devils howling in their torment call aloud His name. In all we see the dispensation of His power. But our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> must preach Him as He is, namely, one Lord not in name but in confession, in one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: for on our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in one Lord Christ depends our confession of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father.</p>

<p>4. But these teachers of a new Christ, who deny to Him all that is His, preach another Lord Christ as well as another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. The One is not the Begetter but the Creator, the Other not begotten, but created. Christ is therefore not very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He is not God by birth, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot recognise a Father in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because there is no generation to constitute Him Father. They glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father indeed, as is His right and due, when they predicate of Him a nature unapproachable, invisible, inviolable, ineffable, and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, endued with omniscience and omnipotence, instinct with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, moving in all and permeating all, immanent and transcendent, sentient in all sentient <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But when they proceed to ascribe to Him the unique <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of being alone good, alone <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, alone <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, who does not feel that this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> praise aims to exclude the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> from the blessedness, which by the reservation 'alone' is restricted to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God? Does it not leave Christ in sinfulness and weakness and death, while the Father reigns in solitary perfection? Does it not deny in Christ a natural origin from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest He should be thought to inherit by a birth, which bestows upon the Begotten the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of nature as the Begetter, a blessedness natural to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father alone?</p>

<p>5. Unlearned in the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and Apostles, they extol the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, not, however, with the sincerity of a devout believer, but with the cunning of impiety, to wrest from it an argument for their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Nothing, they say, can be compared with His nature: therefore the Only-begotten God is excluded from the comparison, because He possesses a lower and weaker nature. And this they say of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the living image of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the perfect form of His blessed nature, the only-begotten offspring of His unbegotten substance; Who is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the image of God unless He possesses the perfect <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Father's blessedness: and reproduces in its exactitude the likeness of His whole nature. But if the Only-begotten God is the image of the Unbegotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the verity of that perfect and supreme nature resides in Him and makes Him the image of the very God. Is the Father <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>? The weak Son is not the image of omnipotence. Is He good? The Son, Whose divinity is of a lower stamp, does not reflect in His sinful nature the image of goodness. Is He incorporeal? The Son, Whose very spirit is confined to the limits of a body, is not in the form of the Incorporeal. Is He ineffable? The Son, Whom language can define, Whose nature the tongue can describe, is not the image of the Ineffable. Is He the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God? The Son possesses only a fictitious divinity, and the false cannot be the image of the True. The Apostle, however, does not ascribe to Christ a portion of the image, or a part of the form, but pronounces Him unreservedly the image of the invisible God and the form of God.  And how could He declare more expressly the divine nature of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, than by saying that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the image of the invisible God even in respect of His invisibility: for if the substance of Christ were discernible how could He be the image of an invisible nature?</p>

<p>6. But, as we pointed out in the former books, they seize the Dispensation of the assumed manhood as a pretext to dishonour His divinity, and distort the Mystery of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> into an occasion of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. Had they held fast the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Apostle, they would neither have forgotten that He, Who was in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, took the form of a servant, nor made use of the servant's form to dishonour the form of God (for the form of God includes the fullness of divinity), but they would have noted, reasonably and reverently, the distinction of occasions  and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, without dishonouring the divinity, or being misled by the Incarnation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But now, when we have, I am convinced, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> everything to the utmost, and pointed out the power of the divine nature underlying the birth of the assumed body, there is no longer room for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. He Who was at once man and the Only-begotten God performed all things by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the power of God accomplished all things through a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. As begotten of God He possessed the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of divine omnipotence, as born of the Virgin He had a perfect and entire humanity. Though He had a real body, He subsisted in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and though He subsisted in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He abode in a real body.</p>

<p>7. In our reply we have followed Him to the moment of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> death, and taking one by one the statements of their unhallowed doctrine, we have refuted them from the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and the Apostle. But even after His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> resurrection there are certain things which they have made bold to construe as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the weakness of a lower nature, and to these we must now reply. Let us adopt once more our usual method of drawing out from the words themselves their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> signification, that so we may discover the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> precisely where they think to overthrow it. For the Lord spoke in simple words for our instruction in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and His words cannot need support or comment from foreign and irrelevant sayings.</p>

<p>8. Among their other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> often employ as an argument the words of the Lord, <em>I ascend unto My Father and your Father, and My God and your God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331229"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;20:17</a></span> His Father is also their Father, His God their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; therefore He is not in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He pronounces <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father of others as of Himself, and His unique Sonship ceases when He shares with others the nature and the origin which make Him Son and God. But let them add further the words of the Apostle, <em>But when He says All things are put in subjection, He is excepted Who did subject all things unto Him. And when all things have been subjected unto Him, then shall He Himself be subjected unto Him that did subject all things unto Himself, that God may be all in all</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331230"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:27-28</a></span>, whereby, since they regard that subjection as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of weakness, they may dispossess Him of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of His Father's nature, because His natural infirmity subjected Him to the dominion of a stronger nature. And after that, let them adopt their very strongest position and their impregnable defence, before which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Divine birth is to be demolished; namely, that if He is subjected, He is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; if His God and Father is ours also, He shares all in common with creatures, and therefore is Himself also a creature: created of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and not begotten, since the creature has its substance out of nothing, but the begotten possesses the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its author.</p>

<p>9. Falsehood is always <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a>, for the liar throwing off the bridle of shame dares to gainsay the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or else at times he hides behind some veil of pretext, that he may appear to defend with modesty what is shameless in intention. But in this case, when they sacrilegiously use the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> to degrade the dignity of our Lord, there is no room for the blush or the false excuse; for there are occasions when even pardon accorded to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is refused, and wilful misconstruction is exposed in its naked profanity. Let us postpone for a moment the exposition of this passage in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and ask them first whether they have forgotten the preaching of the Apostle, who said, <em>Without controversy great is the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of godliness, which was manifested in the flesh, justified in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, seen of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, preached among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on in the world, received up in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331231"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:16</a></span> Who is so dull that he cannot comprehend that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of godliness is simply the Dispensation of the flesh assumed by the Lord? At the outset then, he who does not agree in this confession is not in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the Apostle leaves no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that all must confess that the hidden secret of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is not the dishonour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of great godliness, and a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> no longer kept from our eyes, but manifested in the flesh; no longer weak through the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of flesh, but justified in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>. And so by the justification of the Spirit is removed from our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the idea of fleshly weakness; through the manifestation of the flesh is revealed that which was secret, and in the unknown <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of that which was secret is contained the only confession, the confession of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of great godliness. This is the whole system of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> set forth by the Apostle in its proper order. From godliness proceeds the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> the manifestation in the flesh, from the manifestation in the flesh the justification in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of godliness which was manifested in the flesh, to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, was manifested in the flesh through the justification of the Spirit. Again, we must not forget what manner of justification in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is this manifestation in the flesh: for the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which was manifested in the flesh, justified in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, seen of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, preached among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on in this world, this same <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> was received up in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Thus is it in every way a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of great godliness, when it is manifested in the flesh, when it is justified in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, when it is seen of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, when it is preached among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, when it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on in the world, and when it is received up in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. The preaching follows the seeing, and the believing the preaching, and the consummation of all is the receiving up in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: for the assumption into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of great godliness, and by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Dispensation we are prepared to be received up, and to be conformed to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord. The assumption of flesh is therefore  also the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of great godliness, for through the assumption of flesh the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> was manifested in the flesh. But we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the manifestation in the flesh also is this same <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of great godliness, for His manifestation in the flesh is His justification in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and His assumption into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And now what room does our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> leave for any to think that the secret of the Dispensation of godliness is the enfeebling of the divinity, when through the assumption of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is to be confessed the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of great godliness? What was 'infirmity' is now the '<a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>:' what was 'necessity' becomes 'godliness. ' And now let us turn to the meaning of the Evangelist's words, that the secret of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> may not be converted into an occasion of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>.</p>

<p>10. You credit with the weight of irresistible authority, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, that saying of the Lord, <em>I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331233"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;20:17</a></span> The same Father, you say, is His Father and ours, the same God His God and ours. He partakes, therefore, of our weakness, for in the possession of the same Father we are not inferior as sons, and in the service of the same God we are equal as servants. Since, then, we are of created origin and a servant's nature, but have a common Father and God with Him, He is in common with our nature a creature and a servant. So runs this infatuated and unhallowed teaching. It produces also the words of the Prophet, <em>Your God has anointed You, O God</em>, to prove that Christ does not partake of that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> nature which belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since the God Who anoints Him is preferred before Him as His God. </p>

<p>11. We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Christ the God unless we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God the Begotten. But to be born God is to belong to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the name Begotten signifies indeed the manner of His origin, but does not make Him different in kind from the Begetter. And if so, the Begotten owes indeed to His Author the source of His being, but is not dispossessed of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that Author, for the birth of God can arise but from one origin, and have but one nature. If its origin is not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is not a birth; if it is anything but a birth, Christ is not God. But He <em>is </em>God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father stands to God the Son as God of His birth and Father of His nature, for the birth of God is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the specific nature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>12. See in all that He said, how carefully the Lord tempers the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> acknowledgment of His debt, so that neither the confession of the birth could be held to reflect upon His divinity, nor His reverent <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to infringe upon His sovereign nature. He does not withhold the homage due from Him as the Begotten, Who owed to His Author His very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but He manifests by His confident bearing the consciousness of participation in that nature, which belongs to Him by virtue of the origin whereby He was born as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Take, for instance, the words, <em>He that has seen Me, has seen the Father also</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331235"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;14:9</a></span>, and, <em>The words that I say, I speak not from Myself</em>.  He does not speak from Himself: therefore He receives from His Author that which He says. But if any have seen Him, they have seen the Father also: they are conscious, by this evidence, given to show that God is in Him, that a nature, one in kind with that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was born from God to subsist as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Take again the words, <em>That which the Father has given unto Me, is greater than all</em> , and, <em>I and the Father are one</em>.  To say that the Father gave, is a confession that He received His origin: but the unity of Himself with the Father is a property of His nature derived from that origin. Take another instance, <em>He has given all judgment unto the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that all may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Son even as they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Father</em>.  He acknowledges that the judgment is given to Him, and therefore He does not put His birth in the background: but He claims equal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and therefore He does not resign His nature. Yet another example, <em>I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father is in Me</em> , and, <em>The Father is greater than I</em>.  The One is in the Other: recognise, then, the divinity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Begotten of God: the Father is greater than He: perceive, then, His acknowledgment of the Father's authority. In the same way He says, <em>The Son can do nothing of Himself but what He has seen the Father doing: for what things soever He does, these the Son also does in like manner</em>.  He does nothing of Himself: that is, in accordance with His birth the Father prompts His actions: yet what things soever the Father does, these the Son also does in like manner; that is, He subsists as nothing less than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by the Father's <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> nature residing in Him, can do all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father does. All is uttered in agreement with His unity of Spirit with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the properties of that nature, which He possesses by virtue of His birth. That birth, which brought Him into being, constituted Him divine, and His being reveals the consciousness of that divine nature. God the Son confesses God His Father, because He was born of Him; but also, because He was born, He inherits the whole nature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>13. So the Dispensation of the great and godly <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> makes Him, Who was already Father of the divine Son, also His Lord in the created form which He assumed, for He, Who was in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was found also in the form of a servant. Yet He was not a servant, for according to the Spirit He was God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Every one will agree also that there is no servant where there is no lord. God is indeed Father in the Generation of the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only in the case that the Other is a servant can we call Him Lord as well as Father. The Son was not at the first a servant by nature, but afterwards began to be by nature something which He was not before. Thus the Father is Lord on the same grounds as the Son is servant. By the Dispensation of His nature the Son had a Lord, when He made Himself a servant by the assumption of manhood.</p>

<p>14. Being, then, in the form of a servant, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Who before was in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, said as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <em>I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God</em>. He was speaking as a servant to servants: how can we then dissociate the words from Christ the servant, and transfer them to that nature, which had nothing of the servant in it? For He Who abode in the form of God took upon Him the form of a servant, this form being the indispensable condition of His fellowship as a servant with servants. It is in this sense that God is His Father and the Father of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, His God and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of servants. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was speaking as a man in the form of a servant to men and servants; what difficulty is there then in the idea, that in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> aspect the Father is His Father as ours, in His servant's nature God is His God as all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a>?</p>

<p>15. These, then, are the words with which He prefaces the message, <em>Go unto My brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto My Father and your Father, and My God and your God</em>. I ask, Are they to be understood as His brethren with reference to the form of God or to the form of a servant? And has our flesh kinship with Him in regard to the fullness of the Godhead dwelling in Him, that we should be reckoned His brothers in respect of His divinity? No, for the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> recognises clearly in what respect we are the brethren of the Only-begotten God. It is as <em>a worm and no man</em> that He says, <em>I will declare Your name unto My brethren</em>.  As a worm, which is born without the ordinary process of conception, or else comes up into the world, already living, from the depths of the earth, He speaks here in manifestation of the fact that He had assumed flesh and also brought it up, living, from Hades. Throughout the Psalm He is foretelling by the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of His Passion: it is therefore in respect of the Dispensation, in which He suffered, that He has brethren. The Apostle also recognises the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of this brotherhood, for he calls Him not only the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> from the dead <span class="stiki" id="note331245"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse18">Colossians&nbsp;1:18</a></span>, but also the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> among many brethren. <span class="stiki" id="note331246"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;8:29</a></span> Christ is the Firstborn among many brethren in the same sense in which He is Firstborn from the dead: and as the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of death concerns His body, so the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of brotherhood also refers to His flesh. Thus God has brethren according to His flesh, for the Word became flesh and dwelt among us <span class="stiki" id="note331247"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span>: but the Only-begotten Son, unique as the Only-begotten, has no brethren.</p>

<p>16. By assuming flesh, however, He acquired our nature in our totality, and became all that we are, but did not lose that which He was before. Both before by His heavenly origin, and now by His earthly constitution, God is His Father. By His earthly constitution God is His Father, since all things are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and God is Father to all things, since from Him and in Him are all things. But to the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, God is Father, not only because the Word became flesh; His Fatherhood extends also to Him Who was, as <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, with God in the beginning. Thus, when the Word became flesh, God was His Father both by the birth of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, and by the constitution of His flesh: for God is the Father of all flesh, though not in the same way that He is Father to <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>. But <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, though He did not cease to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, really did become flesh: and while He thus dwelt He was still <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the Word, just as when the Word became flesh He was still <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> God as well as man. For to 'dwell' can only be said of one who abides in something: and to become flesh of one who is born. He dwelt among us; that is, He assumed our flesh. The Word became flesh and dwelt among us; that is, He was God in the reality of our body. If <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, the man according to the flesh, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> of the divine nature, or was not according to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of godliness also <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, then it reduces His nature to our level that God is His Father, and our Father, His God and our God. But if <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, when He became the man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, did not cease to be <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, then God is at the same time His Father and ours, His God and ours, only in respect of that nature, by which the Word is our brother, and the message to His brethren, <em>I ascend unto My Father and your Father, and My God and your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, </em>is not that of the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, but of the Word made flesh.</p>

<p>17. The Apostle here speaks in carefully guarded words, which by their definiteness can give no occasion to the ungodly. We have seen that the Evangelist makes the Lord use the word 'Brethren' in the preface to the message, thus signifying that the whole message, being addressed to His brethren, refers to His fellowship in that nature which makes Him their brother. Thus he makes manifest that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of godliness, which is here proclaimed, is no degradation of His divinity. The community with Him, by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is our Father and His, our God and His, exists in regard to the Dispensation of the flesh: we are counted His brethren, because He was born into the body. No one disputes that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is also the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, but this reverent confession offers no occasion for irreverence. God is His God but not as possessing a different order of divinity from His. He was begotten God of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and born a servant by the Dispensation: and so God is His Father because He is God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God is His <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He is flesh of the Virgin. All this the Apostle confirms in one short and decisive sentence, <em>Making mention of you in my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Father of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331248"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse16">Ephesians&nbsp;1:16-17</a></span> When he speaks of Him as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, he mentions His God: when his theme is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he calls God His Father. To Christ, as having <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, God is Father: to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as being <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, God is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, when speaking of Christ the Lord, Who should be born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, calls Him by the name 'Jesus :' but to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> Christ the Lord is 'Spirit. ' The Apostle's words in this passage seem to many, on account of the Latin, somewhat obscure, for Latin has no articles, which the beautiful and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> usage of Greek employs. The Greek runs, <span class="greek">&#x1F41; &#x0398;&#x03B5;&#x1F78;&#x03C2; &#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x039A;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03BF;&#x03C5; &#x1F21;&#x03BC;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD; &#x1FBF;&#x0399;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x03A7;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6;, &#x1F41; &#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x1F74;&#x03C1; &#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x03B4;&#x1F79;&#x03BE;&#x03B7;&#x03C2;</span>, which we might translate into Latin, if the usage of the article were permitted, 'Ille Deus illius Domini nostri Jesu Christi, ille pater illius claritatis' (The God of the Lord [of us] <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Father of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>). In this form ' <em>The </em>God of <em>the </em><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>,' and ' <em>the </em>Father of <em>the </em><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,' the sentence expresses, so far as we can comprehend them, certain truths of His nature. Where the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Christ is concerned, God is His Father; where Christ is Jesus, there the Father is His God. In the Dispensation by which He is a servant, He has as God Him Whom, in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by which He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He has as Father.</p>

<p>18. Time and the lapse of ages make no difference to a Spirit.  Christ is one and the same Christ, whether in the body, or abiding by the Spirit in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Speaking through the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Patriarch David, He says, <em>Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above Your fellows</em> , which refers to no less a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> than the Dispensation of His assumption of flesh. He, Who now sends the message to His brethren that their Father is His Father, and their God His <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, announced Himself then as anointed by His God above His fellows. No one is fellow to the Only-begotten Christ, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>: but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we are His fellows by the assumption which made Him flesh. That anointing did not exalt the blessed and incorruptible Begotten Who abides in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but it established the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His body, and sanctified the manhood which He assumed. To this the Apostle Peter witnesses, <em>Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in this city were they gathered together against Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Son Jesus, Whom You anointed</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331253"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse27">Acts&nbsp;4:27</a></span>: and on another occasion, <em>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the saying was published through all Jud&aelig;a, beginning from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, after the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which John preached: even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, how that God anointed Him with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and with power</em>.  Jesus was anointed, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the regeneration of flesh might be accomplished. Nor are we left in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> how He was thus anointed with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> and with power, when we listen to the Father's voice, as it spoke when He came up out of the Jordan, <em>You are My Son, this day have I begotten You</em>.  Thus is testified the sanctification of His flesh, and in this testimony we must recognise His anointing with the power of the Spirit.</p>

<p>19. But the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with God in the beginning, and therefore the anointing could neither be related nor explained, if it referred to that nature, of which we are told nothing, except that it was in the beginning. And in fact He Who was God had no need to anoint Himself with the Spirit and power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He was Himself the Spirit and power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So He, being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was anointed by His God <em>above His fellows</em>. And, although there were many Christs (i.e. anointed <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>) according to the Law before the Dispensation of the flesh, yet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who was anointed above His fellows, came <em>after </em>them, for He was preferred above His anointed fellows. Accordingly, the words of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> bring out the fact that the anointing took place in time, and comparatively late in time. <em>You have loved righteousness and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity: therefore Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed You with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above Your fellows</em>. Now, a fact which follows later upon other facts, cannot be dated before them. That a reward be deserved postulates as a prior condition the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of one who can deserve it, for merit earned implies that there has been one capable of acquiring it. If, therefore, we attribute the birth of the Only-begotten God to this anointing, which is His reward for loving righteousness and hating iniquity, we shall be regarding Him not as born, but as promoted by unction, to be the Only-begotten God. But then we imply that He advanced with gradual progress and promotion to perfect divinity, and that He was not born <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but afterwards for His merit anointed God. Thus we shall make Christ as God Himself conditioned, whereas He is the final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all conditions; and what becomes then of the Apostle's words, <em>All things are through Him and in Him, and He is before all, and in Him all things consist</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331256"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse16">Colossians&nbsp;1:16-17</a></span> <em>? </em>The Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was not deified because of anything, or by means of anything, but was born God: God by origin, not promoted to divinity for any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> after His birth, but as the Son; and one in kind with God because begotten of Him. His anointing then, though it is the result of a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, did not enhance that in Him, which could not be made more perfect. It concerned that part of Him which was to be made perfect through the perfection of the Mystery: that is, our manhood was sanctified in Christ by unction. If then the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> here also teaches us the dispensation of the servant, for which Christ is anointed by His God above His fellows, and that because He loved righteousness and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity, then surely the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> must refer to that nature in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by which He has fellows through His assumption of flesh. Can we <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> this when we note how carefully the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> chooses His words? God is anointed by His <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that is, in His own nature He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in the dispensation of the anointing God is His God. God is anointed: but tell me, is that Word anointed, Who was God in the beginning? Manifestly not, for the anointing comes after His divine birth. It was then not the begotten Word, God with God in the beginning, Who was anointed, but that nature in God which came to Him through the dispensation later than His divinity : and when His God anointed Him, He anointed in Him the whole nature of the servant, which He assumed in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His flesh.</p>

<p>20. Let no one then defile with his godless interpretations the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of great godliness which was manifested in the flesh, or reckon himself equal to the Only-begotten in respect of His divine substance. Let Him be our brother and our fellow, inasmuch as the Word made flesh dwelt among us, inasmuch as the man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is Mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Let Him, after the manner of servants, have a common Father and a common God with us, and as anointed above His fellows, let Him be of the same nature as His anointed fellows, though His be an unction of special privilege. In the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Mediatorship let Him be at once very man and very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Himself God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but having a common Father and God with us in that community by which He is our brother.</p>

<p>21. But perhaps that subjection, that delivering of the kingdom, and lastly that end betoken the dissolution of His nature, or the loss of His power, or the enfeebling of His divinity. Many argue thus: Christ is included in the common subjection of all to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by the condition of subjection loses His divinity: He surrenders His Kingdom, therefore He is no longer King: the end which overtakes Him entails as its consequence the loss of His power.</p>

<p>22. It will not be out of place here if we review the full meaning of the Apostle's teaching upon this subject. Let us take, then, each single sentence and expound it, that we may grasp the entire Mystery by comprehending it in its fullness. The words of the Apostle are, <em>For since by man came death, by man came </em> <em>also the resurrection of the dead. For as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, so also in Christ are all made alive. But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then they that are Christ's at His coming. Then comes the end, when He shall have delivered the Kingdom to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when He shall have emptied all authority and all power. For He must reign until He put all enemies under His feet. The last enemy that shall be conquered is death. But when He says, All things are put in subjection, He is excepted Who did subject all things unto Him. But when all things have been subjected to Him, then shall He also Himself be subjected to Him, that did subject all things unto Him, that God may be all in all</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331258"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:21-28</a></span> .</p>

<p>23. The Apostle who was chosen not of men nor through man, but through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, to be the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <span class="stiki" id="note331259"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;1:1</a></span>, expounds in language as express as he can command the secrets of the heavenly Dispensations. He who had been caught up into the third heaven and had heard unspeakable words , reveals to the perception of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> understanding as much as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> can receive. But he does not forget that there are things which cannot be understood in the moment of hearing. The infirmity of man needs time to review before the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and perfect tribunal of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that which is poured indiscriminately into the ears. Comprehension follows the spoken words more slowly than hearing, for it is the ear which hears, but the reason which understands, though it is God Who reveals the inner meaning to those who seek it. We learn this from the words written among many other exhortations to Timothy, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> instructed from a babe in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of his grandmother and mother : <em>Understand what I say, for the Lord shall give you understanding in all things</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331262"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:7</a></span> The exhortation to understand is prompted by the difficulty of understanding. But God's gift of understanding is the reward of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the infirmity of sense is recompensed with the gift of revelation. Timothy, that 'man of God?' as the Apostle witnesses of him <span class="stiki" id="note331263"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:11</a></span>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> child in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> , is exhorted to understand because the Lord will give him understanding in all things: let us, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the Lord will grant us understanding in all things, remember that the Apostle exhorts us also to understand.</p>

<p>24. And if, by an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> incident to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, we be clinging to some preconception of our own, let us not reject the advance in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through the gift of revelation. If we have hitherto used only our own judgment, let that not make us ashamed to change its decisions for the better. Guiding this advance wisely and carefully, the same blessed Apostle writes to the Philippians, <em>Let us therefore as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything you are otherwise minded, this also shall God reveal unto you. Only, wherein we have hastened, in that same let us walk</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331265"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15-16</a></span> Reason cannot anticipate with preconceptions the revelation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the Apostle has here shown us wherein consists the wisdom of those who have the perfect wisdom, and for those who are otherwise minded, he awaits the revelation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that they may obtain the perfect wisdom. If any, then, have otherwise conceived this profound dispensation of the hidden <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and if that which we offer them is in any respect more right or better approved, let them not be ashamed to receive the perfect wisdom, as the Apostle advises, through the revelation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and if they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> to abide in untruth let them not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> more. If to them, who had another wisdom, God has revealed this also, the Apostle exhorts them to hasten on the road in which they have started, to cast aside the notions of their former <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and obtain the revelation of perfect understanding by the path into which they have eagerly entered. Let us, therefore, keep on in the path along which we have hastened: or, if the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of our wandering steps has delayed our eager haste, let us, notwithstanding, start again through the revelation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> towards the goal of our desire, and not turn our feet from the path. We have hastened towards Christ Jesus the Lord of Glory, the King of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> ages, in Whom are restored all things in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and in earth, by Whom all things consist, in Whom and with Whom we shall abide for ever. So long as we walk in this path we have the perfect wisdom: and if we have another wisdom, God will reveal to us what is the perfect wisdom. Let us, then, examine in the light of the Apostle's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the words before us: and let our treatment be, as it always has been, a refutation from the actual <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Apostle's confession of every interpretation, which they would profanely foist upon his words.</p>

<p>25. Three assertions are here disputed, which, in the order in which the Apostle makes them, are first the end, then the delivering, and lastly the subjection. The object is to prove that Christ ceases to exist at the end, that He loses His kingdom, when He delivers it up, that He strips Himself of the divine nature, when He is subjected to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>26. At the outset take note that this is not the order of the Apostle's teaching, for in that order the surrender of the Kingdom is first, then the subjection, and lastly the end. But every <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is itself the result of its particular <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, so that, in every chain of causation, each <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, itself producing a result, has inevitably its underlying antecedent. Thus the end will come, but when He has delivered the Kingdom to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He will deliver the Kingdom, but when He has abolished all authority and power. He will abolish all authority and power, because He must reign. He will reign until He has put all enemies under His feet. He will put all enemies under His feet, because God has subjected everything under His feet. God has so subjected them as to make death the last enemy to be conquered by Him. Then, when all things are subjected unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except Him Who subjected all things unto Him, He too will be subjected unto Him, Who subjects all to Himself. But the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the subjection is none other than that God may be all in all; and therefore the end is that God is all in all.</p>

<p>27. Before going any further we must now enquire whether the end is a dissolution, or the delivering a forfeiture, or the subjection an enfeebling of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And if we find that these are contraries, which cannot be connected as causes and effects, we shall be able to understand the words in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense in which they were spoken.</p>

<p>28. <em>Christ is the end of the law</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331266"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;10:4</a></span>; but, tell me, is He come to destroy it or to fulfil it? And if Christ, the end of the law, does not destroy it, but fulfils it (as He says, <em>I have come not to destroy the law but fulfil it</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331267"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;5:17</a></span>), is not the end of the law, so far from being its dissolution, the very opposite, namely its final perfection? All things are advancing towards an end, but that end is a condition of rest in the perfection, which is the goal of their advance, and not their abolition. Further, all things exist for the sake of the end, but the end itself is not the means to anything beyond: it is an ultimate, all-embracing whole, which rests in itself. And because it is self-contained, and works for no other time or object than itself, the goal is always that to which our hopes are directed. Therefore the Lord exhorts us to wait with patient and reverent <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> until the end comes: <em>Blessed is He that endures to the end</em>.  It is not a blessed dissolution, which awaits us, nor is non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> the fruit, and annihilation the appointed reward of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: but the end is the final attainment of the promised blessedness, and they are blessed who endure until the goal of perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is reached, when the expectation of faithful hope has no object beyond. Their end is to abide with unbroken rest in that condition, towards which they are pressing. Similarly, as a deterrent, the Apostle warns us of the end of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, <em>Whose end is perdition, . . . . . but our expectation is in heaven</em>.  Suppose then we interpret the end as a dissolution, we are forced to acknowledge that, since there is an end for the blessed and for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, the issue levels the godly with the ungodly, for the appointed end of both is a common annihilation. What of our expectation in heaven, if for us as well as for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> the end is a cessation of being? But even if there remains for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> an expectation, whereas for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> there waits the end they have deserved, we cannot conceive that end as a final dissolution. What punishment would it be for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to be beyond the feeling of avenging torments, because the capability of suffering has been removed by dissolution? The end is, therefore, a culminating and irrevocable condition which awaits us, reserved for the blessed and prepared for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</p>

<p>29. We can therefore no longer <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that by the end is meant an ultimate and final condition and not a dissolution. We shall have something more to say upon this subject, when we come to the explanation of this passage, but for the present this is enough to make our meaning clear. Let us, therefore, turn now to the delivering of the Kingdom, and see whether it means a surrender of rule, whether the Son by delivering ceases to possess that which He delivers to the Father. If this is what the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> contend in their unreasoning infatuation, they must allow that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by delivering, lost all, when He delivered all to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, if delivery implies the surrender of that which is delivered. For the Lord said, <em>All things have been delivered unto Me of My Father</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331270"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;10:22</a></span>, and again, <em>All authority has been given unto Me in heaven and earth</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331271"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;28:18</a></span> If, therefore, to deliver is to yield possession, the Father no longer possessed that which He delivered. But if the Father did not cease to possess that which He delivered, neither does the Son surrender that which He delivers. Therefore, if He did not lose by the delivering that which He delivered, we must recognise that only the Dispensation explains how the Father still possesses what He delivered, and the Son does not forfeit what He gave.</p>

<p>30. As to the subjection, there are other facts which come to the help of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and prevent us from putting an indignity on Christ upon this score, but above all this passage contains its own defence. First, however, I appeal to common reason: is the subjection still to be understood as the subordination of servitude to lordship, weakness to power, meanness to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, qualities the opposite of one another? Is the Son in this manner subjected to the Father by the distinction of a different nature? If, indeed, we would think so, we shall find in the Apostle's words a preventive for such <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the imagination. When all things are subjected to Him, says He, then must He be subjected to Him, Who subjects all things to Himself; and by this 'then' he means to denote the temporal Dispensation. For if we put any other construction on the subjection, Christ, though then to be subjected, is not subjected now, and thus we make Him an insolent and impious rebel, whom the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of time, breaking as it were and subduing His profane and overweening <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, will reduce to a tardy <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. But what does He Himself say? <em>I am not come to do My own will, but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that sent Me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331272"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;6:38</a></span>: and again, <em>Therefore has the Father loved Me because I do all things that are pleasing unto Him</em> : and, <em>Father, Your will be done</em>.  Or hear the Apostle, <em>He humbled Himself, becoming <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> even unto death</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331275"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> Although He humbled Himself, His nature <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no humiliation: though He was <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>, it was a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, for He became <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> by humbling Himself. The Only-begotten God humbled Himself, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> His Father even to the death of the Cross: but as what, as man or as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is He to be subjected to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, when all things have been subjected to Him? Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> this subjection is no sign of a fresh <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, but the Dispensation of the Mystery, for the allegiance is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, the subjection an event within time. The subjection is then in its signification simply a demonstration of the Mystery.</p>

<p>31. What that is must be understood in view of this same hope of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. We cannot be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> rose again from the dead, and sits at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for we have also the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the Apostle, <em>According to the working of the strength of His might, which He wrought in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when He raised Him from the dead, and made Him to sit at His right hand in the heavenly places above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to came, and put all things in subjection under His feet</em>.  The language of the Apostle, as befits the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, speaks of the future as already past: for that which is to be wrought by the completion of time already exists in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in Whom is all fullness, and 'future' refers only to the temporal order of the Dispensation, not to a new development. Thus, God has put all things under His feet, though they are still to be subjected. By their subjection, conceived as already past, is expressed the immutable power of Christ: by their subjection, as future, is signified their consummation at the end of the ages as the result of the fullness of time.</p>

<p>32. The meaning of the abolishing of every power which is against Him is not obscure. The prince of the air, the power of spiritual <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, shall be delivered to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> destruction, as Christ says, <em>Depart from Me, you cursed, into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> which My Father has prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331277"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> The abolishing is not the same as the subjecting. To abolish the power of the enemy is to sweep away for ever his prerogative of power, so that by the abolition of his power is brought to an end the rule of his kingdom. Of this the Lord testifies when He says, <em>My kingdom is not of this world</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331278"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;18:36</a></span>: as He had once before testified that the ruler of that kingdom is the prince of the world, whose power shall be destroyed by the abolition of the rule of His kingdom.  A subjection, on the other hand, which implies <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> and allegiance, is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of submission and mutability.</p>

<p>33. So when their authority is abolished, His enemies shall be subjected: and so subjected, that He shall subject them to Himself. Moreover He shall so subject them to Himself, that God shall subject them to Him. Was the Apostle <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, think you, of the force of these words in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <em>No one comes to Me, except the Father draw Him to Me</em> which stand side by side with those other words, <em>No one comes unto the Father but by Me</em> : just as in this Epistle Christ subjects His enemies to Himself, yet God subjects them to Him, and He witnesses throughout this, his work of subjection, that God is working in Him? Except through Him there is no approach to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but there is also no approach to Him, unless the Father draw us. Understanding Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, we recognise in Him the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of the Father. Hence, when we learn to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father calls us: when we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father receives us; for our recognition and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father is in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, Who shows us in Himself <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who draws us, if we be devout, by His fatherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> into a mutual bond with His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. So then the Father draws us, when, as the first condition, He is acknowledged Father: but no one comes to the Father except through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, unless <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Son is active in us, since we cannot approach the Father in worship, unless we first adore the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, while if we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the Father draws us to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life and receives us. But each result is the work of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, for by the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Whom the Son preaches, the Father brings us to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Son leads us to the Father. The statement of this Mystery was necessary for the more perfect understanding of the present passage, to show that through the Son the Father draws us and receives us; that we might understand the two aspects, the Son subjecting all to Himself, and the Father subjecting all to Him. Through the birth the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God is abiding in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and does that which He Himself does. What He does God does, but what God does in Him, He Himself does: in the sense that where He acts Himself we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> acts; and where God acts, we must perceive the properties of the Father's nature existing in Him as the Son.</p>

<p>34. When authorities and powers are abolished, His enemies shall be subjected under His feet. The same Apostle tells who are these enemies, <em>As touching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> they are enemies for your sakes, but as touching the election they are beloved for the fathers' sake</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331282"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;11:28</a></span> We remember that they are enemies of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; let us remember also that, because they are beloved for the fathers' sake, they are reserved for the subjection, as the Apostle says, <em>I would not, brethren, have you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part has befallen <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, until the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> be come in, and so all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be saved, even as it is written, There shall come out of Sion a Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: and this is the covenant firm Me to them, when I have taken away their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></em>.  So His enemies shall be subjected under His feet.</p>

<p>35. But we must not forget what follows the subjection, namely, <em>Last of all is death conquered by Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331284"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:26</a></span> This victory over death is nothing else than the resurrection from the dead: for when the corruption of death is stayed, the quickened and now heavenly nature is made <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, as it is written, <em>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. But when this mortal shall have put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in strife. O death, where is your sting? O death, where is your strife</em>  <em>?</em> In the subjection of His enemies death is conquered; and, death conquered, life <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> follows. The Apostle tells us also of the special reward attained by this subjection which is made perfect by the subjection of belief: <em>Who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, according to the works of His power, whereby He is able to subject all things to Himself</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331286"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians&nbsp;3:21</a></span> There is then another subjection, which consists in a transition from one nature to another, for our nature ceases, so far as its present character is concerned, and is subjected to Him, into Whose form it passes. But by 'ceasing' is implied not an end of being, but a promotion into something higher. Thus our nature by being merged into the image of the other nature which it receives, becomes subjected through the imposition of a new form.</p>

<p>36. Hence the Apostle, to make his explanation of this Mystery complete, after saying that death is the last enemy to be conquered, adds: <em>But when He says, All things are put in subjection except Him, Who did subject all things to Him, then must He be subjected to Him, that did subject all things to Him, that God may be all in all</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331287"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:27-28</a></span> The first step of the Mystery is that all things are subjected to Him: then He is subjected to Him, Who subjects all things to Himself. As we are subjected to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the rule of His body, so He also, reigning in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His body, is by the same Mystery in turn subjected to Him, Who subjects all things to Himself. And we are subjected to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His body, that we may share that splendour with which He reigns in the body, since we shall be conformed to His body.</p>

<p>37. Nor are the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> silent concerning the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His present reigning body. It is written that the Lord said, <em>Verily, I say unto you, there be some of them that stand here, which </em> <em>shall not taste of death till they see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> coming in His Kingdom. And it came to pass, after six days Jesus takes with Him Peter and James and John His brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart. And Jesus was transfigured before them, and His face did shine as the sun, and His garments became as snow.</em>  Thus was shown to the Apostles the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body of Christ coming into His Kingdom: for in the fashion of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Transfiguration, the Lord stood revealed in the splendour of His reigning body.</p>

<p>38. He promised also to the Apostles the participation in this His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. <em>So shall it be in the end of the world. The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> shall send forth His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and they shall gather together out of His Kingdom all things that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> stumbling, and them that do iniquity, and He shall send them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. He that has ears to hear, let him hear</em>.  Were their natural and bodily ears closed to the hearing of the words, that the Lord should need to admonish them to hear? Yet the Lord, hinting at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Mystery, commands them to listen to the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In the end of the world all things that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> stumbling shall be removed from His Kingdom. We see the Lord then reigning in the splendour of His body, until the things that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> stumbling are removed. And we see ourselves, in consequence, conformed to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His body in the Kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, shining as with the splendour of the sun, the splendour in which He showed the fashion of His Kingdom to the Apostles, when He was transfigured on the mountain.</p>

<p>39. He shall deliver the Kingdom to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, not in the sense that He resigns His power by the delivering, but that we, being conformed to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His body, shall form the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>. It is not said, <em>He shall deliver up His Kingdom, </em>but, <em>He shall deliver up the Kingdom</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331290"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:24</a></span>, that is, deliver up to God us who have been made the Kingdom by the glorifying of His body. He shall deliver us into the Kingdom, as it is said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <em>Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331291"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;25:34</a></span> The just shall shine like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father, and the Son shall deliver to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as His Kingdom, those whom He has called into His Kingdom, to whom also He has promised the blessedness of this Mystery, <em>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331292"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> While He reigns, He shall remove all things that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> stumbling, and then the just shall shine as the sun in the Kingdom of the Father. Afterwards He shall deliver the Kingdom to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and those whom He has handed to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as the Kingdom, shall see God. He Himself witnesses to the Apostles what manner of Kingdom this is: <em>The Kingdom of God is within you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331293"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;17:21</a></span> Thus it is as King that He shall deliver up the Kingdom, and if any ask Who it is that delivers up the Kingdom, let him hear, <em>Christ is risen from the dead, the firstfruits of them that sleep; since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331294"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:20-21</a></span> All that is said on the point before us concerns the Mystery of the body, since Christ is the firstfruits of the dead. Let us gather also from the words of the Apostle by what Mystery Christ rose from the dead: <em>Remember that Christ has risen from the dead, of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331295"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:8</a></span> Here he teaches that the death and resurrection are due only to the Dispensation by which Christ was flesh.</p>

<p>40. In His body, the same body though now made <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, He reigns until the authorities are abolished, death conquered, and His enemies subdued. This distinction is carefully preserved by the Apostle: the authorities and powers are <em>abolished</em>, the enemies are <em>subjected</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331296"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:24-25</a></span> Then, when they are subjected, He, that is the Lord, shall be subjected to Him that subjects all things to Himself, that God may be all in all , the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Father's divinity imposing itself upon the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of our body which was assumed. It is thus that God shall be all in all: according to the Dispensation He becomes by His Godhead and His manhood the Mediator between men and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so by the Dispensation He acquires the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of flesh, and by the subjection shall obtain the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in all things, so as to be God not in part, but wholly and entirely. The end of the subjection is then simply that God may be all in all, that no trace of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His earthly body may remain in Him. Although before this time the two were combined within Him, He must now become God only; not, however, by casting off the body, but by translating it through subjection; not by losing it through dissolutions, but by transfiguring it in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: adding humanity to His divinity, not divesting Himself of divinity by His humanity. And He is subjected, not that He may cease to be, but that God may be all in all, having, in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the subjection, to continue to be that which He no longer is , not having by dissolution to be <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> of Himself, that is, to be deprived of His being.</p>

<p>41. We have a sufficient and sacred guarantee for this belief in the authority of the Apostle. Through the Dispensation, and within time, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the firstfruits of them that sleep, is to be subjected, that God may be all in all, and this subjection is not the debasement of His divinity, but the promotion of His assumed nature, for He Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is now altogether God. But some may think that, when we say He was both <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the body while reigning in the body, and is hereafter to be subjected that God may be all in all, our belief finds no support for itself in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> nor yet in the Epistles. We will, therefore, produce testimony of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not only from the words of the Apostle, but also from our Lord's mouth. We will show that Christ said first with His own lips what He afterwards said by the mouth of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.</p>

<p>42. Does He not reveal to His Apostles the Dispensation of this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by the express signification of the words, <em>Now is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, and God is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Him. If God has been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Him, God has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him in Himself, and straightway has He <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him</em>.  In the words, <em>Now is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> honoured, and God is honoured in Him</em>, we have first the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, then the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>. So there is first signified the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body, which it borrows from its association with the divine nature: and then follows the promotion to a fuller <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> derived from an addition to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body. <em>If God has been honoured in Him, God has honoured Him in Himself, and straightway has God honoured Him</em>. God has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him in Himself, because He has already been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Him. <em>God was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Him: </em>this refers to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body, for by this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is expressed in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> is seen the divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. <em>God was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Him, and therefore has God <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him in Himself: </em>that is, by His promotion to the Godhead, whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was increased in Him, God has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him in Himself. Already before this He was reigning in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which springs from the divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: from henceforth, however, He is Himself to pass into the divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. <em>God has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him in Himself: </em>that is, in that nature by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is what He is. <em>That God may be all in all: </em>that His whole being, leaving behind the Dispensation by which He is man, may be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> transformed into divinity. Nor is the time of this hidden from us: <em>And God has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him in Himself, and straightway has He <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him</em>. At the moment when Judas arose to betray Him, He signified as present the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which He would obtain after His Passion through the Resurrection, but assigned to the future the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would glorify Him with Himself. The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God is seen in Him in the power of the Resurrection, but He Himself, out of the Dispensation of subjection, will be taken <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> into the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, into <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the all in all.</p>

<p>43. But what absurd folly is it of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to regard as unattainable for God that goal to which man hopes to attain, to imply that He is powerless to effect in Himself that which He is mighty to effect in us. It is not the language of reason or common sense to say that God is bound by some necessity of His nature to consult our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, but cannot bestow the like blessings upon Himself. God does not, indeed, need any further blessedness, for His nature and power stand fast in their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> perfection. But although in the Dispensation, that <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of great godliness, He Who is God became man, He is not powerless to make Himself again entirely <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> He will transform us also into that which as yet we are not. The final sequel of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life and death is the resurrection: the assured reward of our warfare is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and incorruption, not the ceaseless persistence of everlasting punishment, but the unbroken enjoyment and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. These bodies of earthly origin shall be exalted to the fashion of a higher nature, and conformed to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord's body. But what then of God found in the form of a servant? Though already, while still in the form of a servant, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the body, shall He not be also conformed to God? Shall He bestow upon us the form of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> body, and yet be able to do for His own body nothing more than He does for Himself in common with us? For the most part the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> interpret the words, <em>Then shall He be subjected to Him that did subject all things to Himself, that God may be all in all</em>, as if they meant that the Son is to be subjected to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in order that by the subjection of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father may be all in all. But is there still lacking in God some perfection which He is to obtain by the subjection of the Son? Can they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God does not already possess that final accession of blessed divinity, because it is said that by the coming of the fullness of time He shall be made all in all?</p>

<p>44. To me, who hold that God cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> except by devotion, even to answer such objections seems no less <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> than to support them. What presumption to suppose that words can adequately describe His nature, when thought is often too deep for words, and His nature transcends even the conceptions of thought! What <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> even to discuss whether anything is lacking in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whether He is Himself full, or it remains for Him to be fuller than His fullness! If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is Himself the source of His own <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> divinity, were capable of progress, that He should be greater today than yesterday, He could never reach the time when nothing would be wanting to Him, for the nature to which advance is still possible must always in its progress leave some ground ahead still untrodden: if it be subject to the law of progress, though always progressing it must always be susceptible of further progress. But to Him, Who abides in perfect fullness, Who for ever is, there is no fullness left by which He can be made more full, for perfect fullness cannot receive an accession of further fullness. And this is the attitude of thought in which reverence contemplates <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely, that nothing is wanting to Him, that He is full.</p>

<p>45. But the Apostle does not neglect to say with what manner of confession we should bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <em>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past tracing out! For who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counsellor? Or who has first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed unto him? For of Him, and through Him, and in Him are all things. To Him be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331300"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse33">Romans&nbsp;11:33-36</a></span> No earthly mind can define <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, no understanding can penetrate with its perception to sound the depth of His wisdom. His judgments defy the searching scrutiny of His creatures: the trackless paths of His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> baffle the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of all pursuers. His ways are plunged in the depths of incomprehensibility: nothing can be fathomed or traced to the end in the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. No one has ever been taught to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, no one besides Himself ever permitted to share His counsel. But all this applies to us men only, and not to Him, through Whom are all things, the <em>Angel of mighty Counsel</em> , Who said, <em>No one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Son save the Father: neither does any one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father save the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and him to whom the Son has willed to reveal Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331302"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span> It is to curb our own feeble <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, when it strains itself to fathom the depth of the divine nature with its descriptions and definitions, that we must re-echo the language of the Apostle's exclamation, lest we should attempt by rash conjecture to snatch from God more than He has been pleased to reveal to us.</p>

<p>46. It is a recognised axiom of natural <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, that nothing falls within the scope of the senses unless it is subjected to their observation, as for instance an object placed before the eyes, or an event posterior to the birth of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sense and intelligence. The former we can see and handle, and therefore the mind is qualified to pass a verdict upon it, since it can be examined by the senses of touch and sight. The latter, which is an event in time, produced or constituted since the origin of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, falls within the limits in which the discerning sense may claim to pass judgment, since it is not prior in time to our perception and reason. For our sight cannot perceive the invisible, since it only distinguishes the seen; our reason cannot project itself into the time when it was not, because it can only judge of that, to which it is prior in time. And even within these limits, the infirmity which is bound up with its nature robs it of absolutely certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the sequence of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect. How much less then can it go back behind the time when it had its origin, and comprehend with its perception things which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before it in the realms of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>?</p>

<p>47. The Apostle then recognised that nothing can fall within our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, except it be posterior in time to the faculty of sense. Accordingly when he had asserted the depth of the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the infinity of His inscrutable judgments, the secret of His unsearchable ways, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His unfathomable <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the incomprehensibility of His uncommunicated counsel, he continued, <em>For who has first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? For of Him, and through Him, and in Him are all things</em>. The <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> God is neither subject to limitation, nor did <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reason and intelligence exercise their functions before He had His being. His whole being is therefore a depth, which we can neither examine nor penetrate. We say His <em>whole </em>being, not to define it as limited, but to understand it in its unlimited boundlessness: because of no one has He received His being, no antecedent giver can claim service from Him in return for a gift bestowed: <em>for </em> <em>of Him and through Him and in Him are all things</em>. He does not lack things that are of Him and through Him and in Him. The Source and Maker of all, Who contains all, Who is beyond all, does not need that which is within Him, the Creator His creatures, the Possessor His possessions. Nothing is prior to Him, nothing derived from any other than Him, nothing beyond Him. What element of fullness is still lacking in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which time will supply to make Him all in all? Whence can He receive it, if outside Him is nothing, and while nothing is outside Him, He is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> Himself? And if He is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> Himself, and there is nothing outside Him, with what increase shall He be made full, by what addition shall He be made other than He is? Did He not say, <em>I am and I change not</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331303"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse6">Malachi&nbsp;3:6</a></span> <em>? </em>What possibility is there of change in Him? What scope for progress? What is prior to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>? What more divine than God? The subjection of the Son will not therefore make God to be all in all, nor will any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> perfect Him, from Whom and through Whom and in Whom are all causes. He remains God as He ever was, and He needs nothing further, for what He is, He is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> of Himself and for Himself.</p>

<p>48. But neither is it necessary for the Only-begotten God that He should change. He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that is the name of full and perfect divinity. For, as we said before, the meaning of the repeated glorifying, and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the subjection is that God may be all in all: but it is a Mystery, not a necessity, that God is to be all in all. Christ abode in the form of God when He assumed the form of a servant, not being subjected to change, but emptying Himself; hiding within Himself, and remaining master of Himself though He was emptied. He constrained Himself even to the form and fashion of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, lest the weakness of the assumed humility should not be able to endure the immeasurable power of His nature. His unbounded might contracted itself, until it could fulfil the duty of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> even to the endurance of the body to which it was yoked. But since He was self-contained even when He emptied Himself, His authority suffered no diminution, for in the humiliation of the emptying He exercised within Himself the power of that authority which was emptied.</p>

<p>49. It is therefore for the promotion of us, the assumed humanity, that God shall be all in all. He Who was found in the form of a servant, though He was in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is now again to be confessed in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father: that is, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> He dwells in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> He is to be confessed. All is therefore a dispensation only, and not a change of His nature; for He abides still in Him, in Whom He ever was. But there intervenes a new nature, which began in Him with His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> birth, and so all that He obtains is on behalf of that nature which before was not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since after the Mystery of the Dispensation God is all in all. It is, therefore, we who are the gainers, we who are promoted, for we shall be conformed to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Further the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, despite His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> birth, is nothing less than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is all in all. That subjection of the body, by which all that is fleshly in Him, is swallowed up into the spiritual nature, will make Him to be God and all in all, since He is Man also as well as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and His humanity which advances towards this goal is ours also. We shall be promoted to a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> conformable to that of Him Who became Man for us, being renewed unto the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and created again in the image of the Creator, as the Apostle says, <em>Having put off the old man with his doings, and put on the new man, which is being renewed unto the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, after the image of Him that created him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331304"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse9">Colossians&nbsp;3:9-10</a></span> Thus is man made the perfect image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, being conformed to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the body of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he is exalted to the image of the Creator, after the pattern assigned to the first man. Leaving <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the old man behind, he is made a new man unto the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and arrives at the perfection of his constitution, since through the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his God he becomes the perfect image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Through godliness he is promoted to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, through <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> he shall live for ever as the image of his Creator.</p>
