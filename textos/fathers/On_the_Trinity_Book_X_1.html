<h1>On the Trinity (Book X)</h1>

<div class="stiki"><p>Book X. Theological differences are not the result of honest reasoning, but of reasoning distorted, as in the case of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, by preconceived opinions, whose <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and their result hypocrisy (&sect;&sect; 1-3). Hilary has fallen on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> times foretold by the Apostle; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is banished and so is he, yet his sufferings do not affect his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the Lord (&sect; 4). In the preceding books he has stated the exact <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, of which he now gives a summary (&sect;&sect; 5-8). But the further objection is raised that, while God is impassible, Christ in His Passion suffered <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and pain (&sect; 9). But He Who taught others not to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> death could not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> it Himself (&sect; 10). He died of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that in three days His Body and Spirit would rise again (&sect;&sect; 11, 12). Nor did He <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> bodily tortures, for pain is an affection of the weak <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which inhabits our body, and is not felt by the body itself (&sect;&sect; 13, 14). And, although the Virgin fulfilled entirely the part of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mother, yet the Begetter was Divine. Christ, when He took the form of a servant, remained still in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was born perfect even as the Begetter was perfect, for Mary was not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but only the means, of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life (&sect;&sect; 15, 16). St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> draws a clear distinction between the First Man, who was earthy, and the Second Man, Who was conceived by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and in Whom what is Flesh, in one aspect, is Bread from heaven in another (&sect;&sect; 17, 18). He is therefore perfect Man as well as perfect <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and did not inherit the flesh or the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Adam. His whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is derived from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by Whom the Virgin conceived (&sect;&sect; 19, 20). Again (&sect; 21) the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> argue that the Word was in Jesus in the same sense in which the Spirit was in the Prophets, and reproach the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with denying the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Hilary replies that just as Christ was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the birth of His own <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> Body, so He was the Author of His own <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> Soul: for no <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is transmitted. Thus His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is complete; He has taken the form of a servant, but all the while He is in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, i.e. He Who is God and also Man is one Christ, Who was born and died and rose (&sect; 22). In all this He endured passion but not pain, even as air or water, if pierced by a blow, is unaffected by it. The blow is real, and the Passion was real; but it was not inflicted on our limited humanity but on a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which could walk on water and pass through locked doors (&sect; 23). If it be argued that He wept, hungered, thirsted, Hilary answers that He could wipe away tears and supply needs, and therefore was not subject to them; that though He endured them, as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Man, He was not affected by them. Such sufferings are habitual with men, and He endured them to show that He had a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Body (&sect; 24). For such a Body He had, although (since He was not conceived in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>) one free from the defects of our bodies; not sinful flesh, but only the likeness of sinful flesh. For He was the Word made Flesh, and continued to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God as He had been before (&sect;&sect; 25, 26). The Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> suffered neither <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> nor pain in His Passion, as is shown by the powers which He exercised on the verge of death (&sect;&sect; 27, 28). His utterances in the Garden and on the Cross are not evidences of pain or <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, for they may be matched by lofty expressions of calmness and hope (&sect;&sect; 29-32). Thus no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or pain or weakness can be drawn from the circumstances of the Passion. Nor was the Cross a shame, for it was His road from humiliation to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> (&sect; 33), nor the descent to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> a degradation, for all the while He was in heaven. How different the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Thief on the cross to that of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>! (&sect; 34). The argument is summed up in &sect; 35. Next the Agony is considered. Christ does not say that He is sorrowful on account of death, but unto death. It is anxiety on the Apostles' account, lest their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should fail; a <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> which reached to His death, not beyond, for He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that after His death His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> would revive their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. This was the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in which He was comforted by the Angel; for Himself He was fearless, being conscious of His Godhead (&sect;&sect; 36-43). He was free from pain and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, for it is the sinful body which transmits these affections to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Yet even <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies rise sometimes superior to them, e.g. Daniel and other heroes of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: how much more Christ (&sect;&sect; 44-46). In the same way we must understand His bearing our suffering and our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (&sect; 47), for, as St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, His Passion was itself a triumph (&sect; 48). The complaint that He was forsaken by the Father is similarly explained (&sect; 49). The purpose of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> arguments is to displace the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of Christ as very God and very man in favour of one or other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> hypothesis, all of which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> rejects (&sect;&sect; 50-52). Our reason must recognise its limitations and be content to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, without understanding, apparently contradictory truths (&sect;&sect; 53, 54). Christ weeping over Jerusalem and at the grave of Lazarus is equally inexplicable, yet certain  (&sect;&sect; 55, 56). His laying down and taking again His life is accounted for by the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> inseparably united in one Person (&sect;&sect; 57-62). After a short summary (&sect; 63) he returns to the union of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, which is the stumbling-block of worldly wisdom (&sect; 64), and shows it to be the only reasonable explanation of the facts (&sect;&sect; 65, 66). As St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, our belief must be <em>according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a></em>; the necessity and the rewards of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (&sect;&sect; 67-70). The seeming infirmity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was assumed for our instruction and for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p></div>

<p>1. It is manifest that there is nothing which men have ever said which is not liable to opposition. Where the will dissents the mind also dissents: under the bias of opposing judgment it joins battle, and denies the assertions to which it objects. Though every word we say be incontrovertible if gauged by the standard of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, yet so long as men think or feel differently, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is always exposed to the cavils of opponents, because they attack, under the delusion of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or prejudice, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they misunderstand or dislike. For decisions once formed cling with excessive obstinacy: and the passion of controversy cannot be driven from the course it has taken, when the will is not subject to the reason. Enquiry after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> gives way to the search for <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of what we wish to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; desire is paramount over <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Then the theories we concoct build themselves on names rather than things: the logic of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> gives place to the logic of prejudice: a logic which the will adjusts to defend its fancies, not one which stimulates the will through the understanding of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by the reason. From these defects of partisan spirit arise all controversies between opposing theories. Then follows an obstinate battle between <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> asserting itself, and prejudice defending itself: <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> maintains its ground and prejudice resists. But if desire had not forestalled reason: if the understanding of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> had moved us to desire what was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: instead of trying to set up our desires as doctrines, we should let our doctrines dictate our desires; there would be no contradiction of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for every one would begin by desiring what was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, not by defending the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of that which he desired.</p>

<p>2. Not unmindful of this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of wilfulness, the Apostle, writing to Timothy, after many injunctions to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and to preach the word, adds, <em>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but having itching ears will heap up teachers to themselves after their own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and will turn away their ears from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and turn aside unto fables</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331095"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:3-4</a></span> For when their unhallowed <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> shall drive them beyond the endurance of sound doctrine, they will heap up teachers for their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, that is, construct schemes of doctrine to suit their own desires, not wishing to be taught, but getting together teachers who will tell them what they wish: that the crowd of teachers whom they have ferreted out and gathered together, may satisfy them with the doctrines of their own tumultuous desires. And if these madmen in their godless folly do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> with what spirit they reject the sound, and yearn after the corrupt doctrine, let them hear the words of the same Apostle to the same Timothy, <em>But the Spirit says expressly that in the last days some shall away from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils through the hypocrisy of lying talk</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331096"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:1-2</a></span> What advancement of doctrine is it to discover what one fancies, and not what one ought to learn? Or what <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> in doctrine is it not to desire what one ought to learn, but to heap up doctrine after our desires? But this is what the promptings of seducing spirits supply. They confirm the falsehoods of pretended godliness, for a canting hypocrisy always succeeds to defection from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: so that at least in word the reverence is retained, which the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> has lost. Even that pretended <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> they make impious by all manner of lies, violating by schemes of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a> the sacredness of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: for they pile up doctrines to suit their desires, and not according to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. They delight, with an uncontrollable pleasure, to have their itching ears tickled by the novelty of their favourite preaching; they estrange themselves utterly from the hearing of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and surrender themselves entirely to fables: so that their incapacity for either speaking or understanding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> invests their discourse with what is, to them, a semblance of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>3. We have clearly fallen on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> times prophesied by the Apostle; for nowadays teachers are sought after who preach not God but a creature.  And men are more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for what they themselves desire, than for what the sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> teaches. So far have their itching ears stirred them to listen to what they desire, that for the moment that preaching alone rules among their crowd of doctors which estranges the Only-begotten God from the power and nature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and makes Him in our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> either a God of the second order, or not a God at all; in either case a damning profession of impiety, whether one profess two Gods by making different grades of divinity; or else deny divinity altogether to Him Who drew His nature by birth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Such doctrines please those whose ears are estranged from the hearing of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and turned to fables, while the hearing of this our sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not endured, and is driven bodily into exile with its preachers.</p>

<p>4. But though many may heap up teachers according to their desires, and banish sound doctrine, yet from the company of the Saints the preaching of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> can never be exiled. From our exile we shall speak by these our writings, and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> which cannot be bound will run unhindered, warning us of this time which the Apostle prophesied. For when men show themselves impatient of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> message, and heap up teachers according to their own <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> desires, we can no longer <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the times, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that while the preachers of sound doctrine are banished  <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is banished too. We do not complain of the times: we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> rather, that iniquity has revealed itself in this our exile, when, unable to endure the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it banishes the preachers of sound doctrine, that it may heap up for itself teachers after its own desires. We <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in our exile, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the Lord that in our person the Apostle's <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> should be fulfilled.</p>

<p>5. In the earlier books, then, while maintaining the profession of a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, I trust, sincere, and a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> uncorrupted, we arranged the method of our answer throughout, so that (though such are our limitations, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> language can never be safe from exception) no one could contradict us without an open profession of godlessness. For so completely have we demonstrated the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of those texts which they cunningly filch from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and appropriate for their own teaching, that if any one denies it, he cannot escape on the plea of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but is condemned out of his own mouth of godlessness. Further, we have, according to the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, so cautiously proceeded throughout in our <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that no charge could possibly be trumped up against us. For it is their way to fill the ears of the unwary with declarations that we deny the birth of Christ , when we preach the unity of the Godhead; and they say that by the text, <em>I and the Father are one</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331100"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span>, we confess that God is solitary: thus, according to them, we say that the Unbegotten God descended into the Virgin, and was born man, and that He refers  the opening word 'I' to the dispensation of His flesh, but adds to it the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His divinity, <em>And the Father</em>, as being the Father of Himself as man; and further, that, consisting of two Persons, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and divine, He said of Himself, <em>We are one</em>. </p>

<p>6. But we have always maintained the birth existing out of time: we have taught that God the Son is God of the same nature with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, not co-equal with the Unbegotten, for He was not Himself Unbegotten, but, as the Only-begotten, not unequal because begotten; that the Two are One, not by the giving of a double name to one Person, but by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> begetting and being begotten; that neither are there two Gods, different in kind, in our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nor is God solitary because He is one, in the sense in which we confess the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Only-begotten God: but that the Son is both indicated in the name of, and exists in, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Whose name and Whose nature are in Him, while the Father by His name implies, and abides in, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, since a son cannot be spoken of, or exist, except as born of a father. Further, we say that He is the living copy of the living nature, the impression of the divine seal upon the divine nature, so undistinguished from God in power and kind, that neither His works nor His words nor His form are other than the Father's: but that, since the image by nature possesses the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its author, the Author also has worked and spoken and appeared through His natural image.</p>

<p>7. But by the side of this timeless and ineffable generation of the Only-begotten, which transcends the perception of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> understanding, we taught as well the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of God born to be man from the womb of the Virgin, showing how according to the plan of the Incarnation, when He emptied Himself of the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and took the form of a servant, the weakness of the assumed humanity did not weaken the divine nature, but that Divine power was imparted to humanity without the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of divinity being lost in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form. For when God was born to be man the purpose was not that the Godhead should be lost, but that, the Godhead remaining, man should be born to be God. Thus <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a> is His name, which is <em>God with us</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331103"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;1:23</a></span>, that God might not be lowered to the level of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but man raised to that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nor, when He asks that He may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <span class="stiki" id="note331104"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;17:5</a></span>, is it in any way a glorifying of His divine nature, but of the lower nature He assumed: for He asks for that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which He had with God before the world was made.</p>

<p>8. As we are answering all, even their most insensate statements, we come now to the discussion of the unknown hour.  Now, even if, as they say, the Son had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, this could give no ground for an attack upon His Godhead as the Only-begotten. It was not in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things that His birth should avail to put His beginning back, until it was equivalent to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> which is unbegotten, and had no beginning; and the Father reserves as His prerogative, to demonstrate His authority as the Unbegotten, the fixing of this still undetermined day. Nor may we conclude that in His Person there is any defect in that nature which contained by right of birth all the fullness of that nature which a perfect birth could impart. Nor again could the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of day and hour be imputed in the Only-begotten God to a lower degree of Divinity. It is to demonstrate against the Sabellian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> that the Father's authority is without birth or beginning, that this prerogative of unbegotten authority is not granted to the Son.  But if, as we have maintained, when He said that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the day, He kept silence not from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but in accordance with the Divine Plan, all occasion for irreverent declarations must be removed, and the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> teachings of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> thwarted, that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> may be illustrated by the very words which seem to obscure it.</p>

<p>9. Thus the greater number of them will not allow Him to have the impossible nature of God because He feared His Passion and showed Himself weak by submitting to suffering.  They assert that He Who feared and felt pain could not enjoy that confidence of power which is above <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, or that incorruption of spirit which is not conscious of suffering: but, being of a nature lower than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He trembled with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> at <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> suffering, and groaned before the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of bodily pain. These impious assertions are based on the words, <em>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sorrowful even unto death</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331108"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;26:38</a></span>, and <q> <em>Father if it be possible let this cup pass away from Me</em></q> , and also, <em>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have You forsaken Me</em>  <em>? </em>to which they also add, <em>Father into Your hands I commend My Spirit</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331111"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;23:46</a></span> All these words of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they appropriate to the use of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>: that He feared, Who was sorrowful, and even <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that the cup might be taken away from Him; that He felt pain, because He complained that God had deserted Him in His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a>; that He was infirm, because He commended His Spirit to the Father. His doubts and anxieties preclude us, they say, from assigning to Him that likeness to God which would belong to a nature equal to God as being born His Only-begotten. He proclaims His own weakness and inferiority by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to remove the cup, by the complaint of desertion and the commending of His Spirit.</p>

<p>10. Now first of all, before we show from these very texts, that He was subject to no infirmity of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or sorrow on His own account, let us ask, <q>What can we find for Him to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, that the dread of an unendurable pain should have seized Him?</q> The objects of His <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, which they allege, are, I suppose, suffering and death. Now I ask those who are of this opinion, Can we reasonably suppose that He feared death, Who drove away the terrors of death from His Apostles, exhorting them to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> with the words, <em>He that does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worth of Me; </em>and, <em>He that finds his life shall lose it, and he that has lost his life for My sake shall find it</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331112"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;10:38-39</a></span> <em>? </em>If to die for Him is life, what pain can we think He had to suffer in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of death, Who rewards with life those who die for Him? Could death make Him <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> what could be done to the body, when He exhorted the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <em>Fear not those which kill the body</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331113"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;10:28</a></span> <em>?</em></p>

<p>11. Further, what terror had the pain of death for Him, to Whom death was an act of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>? In the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> death is brought on either by an attack upon the body of an external enemy, such as fever wound, accident or fall: or our bodily nature is overcome by age, and yields to death. But the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who had the power of laying down His life, and of taking it up again <span class="stiki" id="note331114"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;10:18</a></span>, after the drought of vinegar, having borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that His work of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> suffering was finished, in order to accomplish in Himself the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of death, bowed His head and gave up His Spirit.  If it has been granted to our mortal nature of its own will to breathe its last breath, and seek rest in death; if the buffeted <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may depart, without the breaking up of the body, and the spirit burst forth and flee away, without being as it were violated in its own home by the breaking and piercing and crushing of limbs; then <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death might seize the Lord of life; if, that is, when He gave up the ghost and died, His death were not an exercise of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. But if He died of His own will, and through His own will gave back His Spirit, death had no terror; because it was in His own power.</p>

<p>12. But perchance with the fearfulness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, He feared the very power of death, which He possessed; so, though He died of His own accord, He feared because He was to die. If any think so, let them ask <q>To which was death terrible, to His Spirit or to His body?</q> If to His body, are they <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that the Holy One should not see corruption , that within three days He was to revive the temple of His body ? But if death was terrible to His Spirit, should Christ <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the abyss of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, while Lazarus was rejoicing in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom? It is foolish and absurd, that He should <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> death, Who could lay down His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and take it up again, Who, to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, was about to die of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. He cannot <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> death Whose power and purpose in dying is to die but for a moment: <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is incompatible with willingness to die, and the power to live again, for both of these rob death of his terrors.</p>

<p>13. But was it perhaps the physical pain of hanging on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, or the rough cords with which He was bound, or the cruel wounds, where the nails were driven in, that dismayed Him? Let us see of what body the Man Jesus was, that pain should dwell in His crucified, bound, and pierced body.</p>

<p>14. The nature of our bodies is such, that when endued with life and feeling by conjunction with a sentient <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, they become something more than inert, insensate matter. They feel when touched, suffer when pricked, shiver with cold, feel pleasure in warmth, waste with hunger, and grow fat with food. By a certain transfusion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which supports and penetrates them, they feel pleasure or pain according to the surrounding circumstances. When the body is pricked or pierced, it is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which pervades it that is conscious, and suffers pain. For instance a flesh-wound is felt even to the bone, while the fingers feel nothing when we cut the nails which protrude from the flesh. And if through some disease a limb becomes withered, it loses the feeling of living flesh: it can be cut or burnt, it feels no pain whatever, because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is no longer mingled with it. Also when through some grave necessity part of the body must be cut away, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can be lulled to sleep by drugs, which overcome the pain, and produce in the mind a death-like forgetfulness of its power of sense. Then limbs can be cut off without pain: the flesh is dead to all feeling, and does not heed the deep thrust of the knife, because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> within it is asleep. It is, therefore, because the body lives by admixture with a weak <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that it is subject to the weakness of pain.</p>

<p>15. If the Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> began His bodily life with the same beginning as our body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, if He were not, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the immediate Author of His own body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alike, when He was fashioned in the likeness and form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and born as man, then we may suppose that He felt the pain of our body; since by His beginning, a conception like ours, He had a body animated with a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> like our own. But if through His own act He took to Himself flesh from the Virgin, and likewise by His own act joined a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the body thus conceived, then the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a> must have corresponded with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For when He emptied Himself of the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and received the form of a servant when the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was born also <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, without losing His own self and power, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> formed the perfect living Man. For how was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> born <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, how did He receive the form of a servant, still remaining in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless (<a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> being able of Himself to take flesh from the Virgin and to give that flesh a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for the redemption of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body), the Man Christ Jesus was born perfect, and made in the form of a servant by the assumption of the body, which the Virgin conceived? For the Virgin conceived, what she conceived, from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> alone , and though for His birth in the flesh she supplied from herself that element, which <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> always contribute to the seed planted in them, still <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was not formed by an ordinary <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conception. In His birth, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of which was transmitted solely by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, His mother performed the same part as in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conceptions: but by virtue of His origin He never ceased to be God.</p>

<p>16. This deep and beautiful <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His assumption of manhood the Lord Himself reveals in the words, <em>No man has ascended into heaven, but He that descended from heaven, even the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> which is in heaven</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331119"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;3:13</a></span> 'Descended from heaven' refers to His origin from the Spirit: for though Mary contributed to His growth in the womb and birth all that is natural to her sex, His body did not owe to her its origin. The '<a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>' refers to the birth of the flesh conceived in the Virgin; 'Who is in heaven' implies the power of His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> nature: an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> nature, which could not restrict itself to the limits of the body, of which it was itself the source and base. By the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the Spirit and the power of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, though He abode in the form of a servant, He was ever present as Lord of all, within and beyond the circle of heaven and earth. So He descended from heaven and is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, yet is in heaven: for the Word made flesh did not cease to be the Word. As the Word, He is in heaven, as flesh He is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>. As Word made flesh, He is at once from heaven, and <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, and in heaven, for the power of the Word, abiding <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> without body, was present still in the heaven He had left: to Him and to none other the flesh owed its origin. So the Word made flesh, though He was flesh, yet never ceased to be the Word.</p>

<p>17. The blessed Apostle also perfectly describes this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the ineffable birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body in the words, <em>The first man was from the soil of the ground, the second man from heaven</em>.  Calling Him 'Man' he expresses His birth from the Virgin, who in the exercise of her office as mother, performed the duties of her sex in the conception and birth of man. And when he says, <em>The second man from heaven </em>he testifies His origin from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Who came upon the Virgin.  As He is then man, and from heaven, this Man was born of the Virgin, and conceived of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. So speaks the Apostle.</p>

<p>18. Again the Lord Himself revealing this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His birth, speaks thus: <em>I am the living bread Who have descended from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>: if any one shall eat of My bread he shall live for ever</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331122"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse51">John&nbsp;6:51</a></span> <em>:</em> calling Himself the Bread since He is the origin of His own body. Further, that it may not be thought the Word left His own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and nature for the flesh, He says again that it is His bread; since He is the bread which descends from heaven, His body cannot be regarded as sprung from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conception, because it is shown to be from heaven. And His language concerning His bread is an assertion that the Word took a body, for He adds, <em>Unless you eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> and drink His blood, you have not life in you</em>.  Hence, inasmuch as the Being Who is <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> descended also as bread from heaven, by the 'Bread descending from heaven' and by the 'Flesh and Blood of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>' must be understood His assumption of the flesh, conceived by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and born of the Virgin.</p>

<p>19. Being, then, Man with this body, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is both the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, Who emptied Himself of the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and received the form of a servant. There is not one <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> and another <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; nor one in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and another born perfect man in the form of a servant: so that, as by the nature determined for us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Author of our being, man is born with body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so likewise <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, by His own power, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> with flesh and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, possessing in Himself whole and perfect manhood, and whole and perfect Godhead.</p>

<p>20. Yet many, with the art by which they seek to prove their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, are wont to delude the ears of the unlearned with the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, that as the body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> both <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, so the Lord must have taken the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> from the Virgin, and that it was not the whole Man that she conceived from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.  If they had understood the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Incarnation, these men would have understood at the same time the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> is also <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. As if in receiving so much from the Virgin, He received from her His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also; whereas though flesh is always born of flesh, every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the direct work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>21. With a view to deprive of substantive divinity the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who was <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> with God in the beginning, they make Him merely the utterance of the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The Son is related to God His Father, they say, as the words to the speaker. They are trying to creep into the position, that it was not God the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Word, abiding in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who was born as Christ the Man, Whose life therefore springs from a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> origin, not from the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of a spiritual conception; that He was not <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, making Himself man by birth from the Virgin, but the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> dwelling in Jesus as the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> dwelt in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. They accuse us of saying that Christ was born man with body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> different from ours. But we preach the Word made flesh, Christ emptying Himself of the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and taking the form of a servant, perfect according to the fashion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form, born a man after the likeness of ourselves: that being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, He is indeed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, neither the less Man because born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor the less God because Man born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>22. But as He by His own act assumed a body from the Virgin, so He assumed from Himself a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; though even in ordinary <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> birth the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is never derived from the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. If, then, the Virgin received from God alone the flesh which she conceived, far more certain is it that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of that body can have come from God alone. If, too, the same Christ be the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, Who is also the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> (for the whole <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> is the whole <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>), how ridiculous is it to preach besides the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the Word made flesh, another I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whom, inspired, like a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, by <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>; whereas <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is both <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> and <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Yet because His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was sorrowful unto death, and because He had the power to lay down His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the power to take it up again, they want to derive it from some alien source, and not from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the Author of His body's conception: for <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> became man without departing from the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His own nature. He was born also not to be at one time two separate beings, but that it might be made plain, that He Who was God before He was Man, now that He has taken humanity, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a>. How could <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, have been born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, except by the Word becoming flesh: that is by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, though in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, taking the form of a slave? When He Who was in the form of God took the form of a slave, two contraries were brought together.  Thus it was just as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that He received the form of a slave, as that He remained in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The use of the one word 'form' to describe both natures compels us to recognise that He <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> possessed both. He is in the <em>form </em>of a servant, Who is also in the <em>form </em>of God.  And though He is the latter by His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> nature, and the former in accordance with the divine Plan of Grace, the word has its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> significance equally in both cases, because He is both: as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> in the form of God as in the form of Man. Just as to take the form of a servant is none other than to be born a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so to be in the form of God is none other than to be God: and we confess Him as one and the same Person, not by loss of the Godhead, but by assumption of the manhood: in the form of God through His divine nature, in the form of man from His conception by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, being found in fashion as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. That is why after His birth as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a>, death, and burial, He also rose again. We cannot separate Him from Himself in all these diverse <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, so that He should be no longer Christ; for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who took the form of a servant, was none other than He Who was in the form of God: He Who died was the same as He Who was born: He Who rose again as He Who died; He Who is in heaven as He Who rose again; lastly, He Who is in heaven as He Who before descended from heaven.</p>

<p>23. So the Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as flesh and as Word at the same time <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> and <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, without ceasing to be Himself, that is, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, took <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> humanity after the likeness of our humanity. But when, in this humanity, He was struck with blows, or smitten with wounds, or bound with ropes, or lifted on high, He felt the force of suffering, but without its pain. Thus a dart passing through water, or piercing a flame, or wounding the air, inflicts all that it is its nature to do: it passes through, it pierces, it wounds; but all this is without effect on the thing it strikes; since it is against the order of nature to make a hole in water, or pierce flame, or wound the air, though it is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a dart to make holes, to pierce and to wound. So <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> suffered blows, hanging, crucifixion and death: but the suffering which attacked the body of the Lord, without ceasing to be suffering, had not the natural effect of suffering. It exercised its function of punishment with all its <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>; but the body of Christ by its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> suffered the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the punishment, without its consciousness. True, the body of the Lord would have been capable of feeling pain like our natures, if our bodies possessed the power of treading on the waters, and walking over the waves without weighing them down by our tread or forcing them apart by the pressure of our steps, if we could pass through solid substances, and the barred doors were no obstacle to us. But, as only the body of our Lord could be borne up by the power of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the waters, could walk upon the waves, and pass through walls, how can we judge of the flesh conceived of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> on the analogy of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body? That flesh, that is, that Bread, is from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>; that humanity is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He had a body to suffer, and He suffered: but He had not a nature  which could feel pain. For His body possessed a unique nature of its own; it was transformed into heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> on the Mount, it put fevers to flight by its touch, it gave new eyesight by its spittle.</p>

<p>24. It may perhaps be said, 'We find Him giving way to weeping, to hunger and thirst: must we not suppose Him liable to all the other affections of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>?' But if we do not understand the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His tears, hunger, and thirst, let us remember that He Who wept also raised the dead to life: that He did not weep for the death of Lazarus, but rejoiced ; that He Who thirsted, gave from Himself rivers of living water. <span class="stiki" id="note331129"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;7:38</a></span> He could not be parched with thirst, if He was able to give the thirsty drink. Again, He Who hungered could condemn the tree which offered no fruit for His hunger : but how could His nature be overcome by hunger if He could strike the green tree barren by His word? And if, beside the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of weeping, hunger and thirst, the flesh He assumed, that is His entire manhood, was exposed to our weaknesses: even then it was not left to suffer from their indignities. His weeping was not for Himself; His thirst needed no water to quench it; His hunger no food to stay it. It is never said that the Lord ate or drank or wept when He was hungry, or thirsty, or sorrowful. He conformed to the habits of the body to prove the reality of His own body, to satisfy the custom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies by doing as our nature does. When He ate and drank, it was a concession, not to His own necessities, but to our habits.</p>

<p>25. For Christ had indeed a body, but unique, as befitted His origin. He did not come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> through the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> incident to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conception: He came into the form of our body by an act of His own power. He bore our collective humanity in the form of a servant, but He was free from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and imperfections of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body: that we might be in Him, because He was born of the Virgin, and yet our faults might not be in Him, because He is the source of His own humanity, born as man but not born under the defects of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conception. It is this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His birth which the Apostle upholds and demonstrates, when he says, <em>He humbled Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of a man and being formed in fashion as a man</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331131"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians&nbsp;2:7</a></span>: that is, in that He took the form of a servant, He was born in the form of a man: in that He was made in the likeness of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and formed in fashion as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the appearance and reality of His body testified His humanity, yet, though He was formed in fashion as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was. For His conception was in the likeness of our nature, not in the possession of our faults. For lest the words, <em>He took the form of a servant</em>, might be understood of a natural birth, the Apostle adds, <em>made in the likeness of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and formed in fashion as a man</em>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His birth is thus prevented from suggesting the defects incident to our weak natures, since the <em>form of a servant </em>implies the reality of His birth, and found in fashion as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the likeness of our nature. He was of Himself born man through the Virgin, and found in the likeness of our degenerate body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: as the Apostle testifies in his letter to the Romans, <em>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His Son in the likeness of flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, condemned <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331132"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;8:3</a></span> He was not <em>found in the fashion of a man: </em>but <em>found in fashion as a man: </em>nor was His flesh the flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but the likeness of the flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Thus the fashion of flesh implies the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His birth, and the likeness of the flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> removes Him from the imperfections of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness. So the Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> as man was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born, as Christ had no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in His nature: for, on His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> side, He was born, and could not but be a man; on His divine side, He could never cease to be Christ. Since then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was man, He submitted as man to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> birth: yet as Christ He was free from the infirmity of our degenerate race.</p>

<p>26. The Apostles' belief prepares us for the understanding of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>; when it testifies that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was found in fashion as a man and was sent in the likeness of the flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For being fashioned as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He is in the form of a servant, but not in the imperfections of a servant's nature; and being in the likeness of the flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the Word is indeed flesh, but is in the likeness of the flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and not the flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself. In like manner <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> being man is indeed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but even thus cannot be anything else but Christ, born as man by the birth of His body, but not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> in defects, as He was not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> in origin. The Word made flesh could not but be the flesh that He was made; yet He remained always the Word, though He was made flesh. As the Word made flesh could not vacate the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His Source, so by virtue of the origin of His nature He could not but remain the Word: but at the same time we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Word is that flesh which He was made; always, however, with the reserve, that when He dwelt among us, the flesh was not the Word, but was the flesh of the Word dwelling in the flesh.</p>

<p>Though we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> this, still we will see whether in the whole range of suffering, which He endured, we can anywhere detect in our Lord the weakness of bodily pain. We will put off for a time the discussion of the passages on the strength of which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> has attributed <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to our Lord; now let us turn to the facts themselves: for His words cannot signify <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> if His actions display confidence.</p>

<p>27. Do you suppose, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, that the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> feared to suffer? Why, when Peter made this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, did He not call him '<a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>' and a 'stumbling-block <span class="stiki" id="note331133"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;16:22-23</a></span>?' Thus was Peter, who deprecated the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Passion, established in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by so sharp a rebuke from the lips of the gentle Christ, Whom not flesh and blood, but the Father in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> had revealed to him. </p>

<p>What phantom hope are you chasing when you deny that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and attribute to Him <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of suffering? He afraid, Who went forth to meet the armed bands of His captors? Weakness in His body, at Whose approach the pursuers reeled and broke their ranks and fell prone, unable to endure His Majesty as He offered Himself to their chains? What weakness could enthral His body, Whose nature had such power?</p>

<p>28. But perhaps He feared the pain of wounds. Say then, What terror had the thrust of the nail for Him Who merely by His touch restored the ear that was cut off? You who assert the weakness of the Lord, explain this work of power at the moment when His flesh was weak and suffering. Peter drew his sword and smote: the High Priest's servant stood there, lopped of his ear. How was the flesh of the ear restored from the bare wound by the touch of Christ? Amidst the flowing blood, and the wound left by the cleaving sword, when the body was so maimed, whence sprang forth an ear which was not there? Whence came that which did not exist before? Whence was restored that which was wanting? Did the hand, which created an ear, feel the pain of the nails? He prevented another from feeling the pain of a wound: did He feel it Himself? His touch could restore the flesh that was cut off; was He sorrowful because He feared the piercing of His own flesh? And if the body of Christ had this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, dare we allege infirmity in that nature, whose natural force could counteract all the natural infirmities of man?</p>

<p>29. But, perhaps, in their misguided and impious perversity, they infer His weakness from the fact that His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was sorrowful unto death. <span class="stiki" id="note331135"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;26:38</a></span> It is not yet the time to blame you, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, for misunderstanding the passage. For the present I will only ask you, Why do you forget that when Judas went forth to betray Him, He said, <em>Now is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a></em> <span class="stiki" id="note331136"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;13:31</a></span> <em>? </em>If suffering was to glorify Him, how could the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of it have made Him sorrowful? How, unless He was so void of reason, that He feared to suffer when suffering was to glorify Him?</p>

<p>30. But perhaps He may be thought to have feared to the extent that He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that the cup might be removed from Him: <em>Abba, Father, all things are possible unto You: remove this cup from Me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331137"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse36">Mark&nbsp;14:36</a></span> To take the narrowest ground of argument, might you not have refuted for yourself this dull impiety by your own reading of the words, <em>Put up your sword into its sheath: the cup which My Father has given Me, shall I not drink it</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331138"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;18:11</a></span> <em>?</em> Could <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> induce Him to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the removal from Him of that which, in His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the Divine Plan, He was hastening to fulfil? To say He shrank from the suffering He desired is not consistent. You allow that He suffered willingly: would it not be more reverent to confess that you had misunderstood this passage, than to rush with <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> and headlong folly to the assertion that He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to escape suffering, though you allow that He suffered willingly?</p>

<p>31. Yet, I suppose, you will arm yourself also for your godless contention with these words of the Lord, <em>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have You forsaken Me</em>  <em>? </em>Perhaps you think that after the disgrace of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, the favour of His Father's help departed from Him, and hence His cry that He was left alone in His weakness. But if you regard the contempt, the weakness, the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as a disgrace, you should remember His words, <em>Verily I say unto you, From henceforth you shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> sitting at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a></em>. </p>

<p>32. Where, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, can you see <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in His Passion? Where weakness? Or pain? Or dishonour? Do the godless say He feared? But He proclaimed with His own lips His willingness to suffer. Do they maintain that He was weak? He revealed His power, when His pursuers were stricken with panic and dared not face Him. Do they contend that He felt the pain of the wounds in His flesh? But He showed, when He restored the wounded flesh of the ear, that, though He was flesh, He did not feel the pain of fleshly wounds. The hand which touched the wounded ear belonged to His body: yet that hand created an ear out of a wound: how then can that be the hand of a body which was subject to weakness?</p>

<p>33. But, they say, the cross was a dishonour to Him; yet it is because of the cross that we can now see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> sitting on the right hand of power, that He Who was born man of the womb of the Virgin has returned in His Majesty with the clouds of heaven. Your irreverence blinds you to the natural relations of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and event: not only does the spirit of godlessness and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, with which you are filled, hide from your understanding the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but the obtuseness of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> drags you below the level of ordinary <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> intelligence. For it stands to reason that whatever we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, we avoid: that a weak nature is a prey to terror by its very feebleness: that whatever feels pain possesses a nature always liable to pain: that whatever dishonours is always a degradation. On what reasonable principle, then, do you hold that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> feared that towards which He pressed: or awed the brave, yet trembled Himself with weakness: or stopped the pain of wounds, yet felt the pain of His own: or was dishonoured by the degradation of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, yet through the cross sat down by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on high, and returned to His Kingdom?</p>

<p>34. But perhaps you think your impiety has still an opportunity left to see in the words, <em>Father, into Your hands I commend My Spirit</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331141"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;23:46</a></span>, a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that He feared the descent into the lower world, and even the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of death. But when you read these words and could not understand them, would it not have been better to say nothing, or to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> devoutly to be shown their meaning, than to go astray with such barefaced assertions, too mad with your own folly to perceive the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Could you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He feared the depths of the abyss, the scorching flames, or the pit of avenging punishment, when you listen to His words to the thief on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, <em>Verily, I say unto you, Today shall you be with Me in Paradise</em>  <em>? </em>Such a nature with such power could not be shut up within the confines of the nether world, nor even subjected to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of it. When He descended to Hades, He was never absent from Paradise (just as He was always in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> when He was preaching on earth as the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>), but promised His <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>  a home there, and held out to him the transports of perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Bodily <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> cannot touch Him Who reaches indeed down as far as Hades, but by the power of His nature is present in all things everywhere. As little can the abyss  of Hell and the terrors of death lay hold upon the nature which rules the world, boundless in the freedom of its spiritual power, confident of the raptures of Paradise; for the Lord Who was to descend to Hades, was also to dwell in Paradise. Separate, if you can, from His indivisible nature a part which could <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> punishment: send the one part of Christ to Hades to suffer pain, the other, you must leave in Paradise to reign: for the thief says, <em>Remember me when You come in Your Kingdom</em>. It was the groan he heard, I suppose, when the nails pierced the hands of our Lord, which provoked in him this blessed confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: he learned the Kingdom of Christ from His weakened and stricken body! He begs that Christ will remember him when He comes in His Kingdom: <em>you </em>say that Christ feared as He hung dying upon the cross. The Lord promises him, <em>Today shall you be with Me in Paradise; you </em>would subject Christ to Hades and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment. Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has the opposite expectation. The thief confessed Christ in His Kingdom as He hung on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and was rewarded with Paradise from the cross: you who impute to Christ the pain of punishment and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death, will fail of Paradise and His Kingdom.</p>

<p>35. We have now seen the power that lay in the acts and words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. We have incontestably <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that His body did not share the infirmity of a natural body, because its power could expel the infirmities of the body that when He suffered, suffering laid hold of His body, but did not inflict upon it the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of pain: and this because, though the form of our body was in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, yet He by virtue of His origin was not in the body of our weakness and imperfection. He was conceived of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and born of the Virgin, who performed the office of her sex, but did not receive the seed of His conception from man.  She brought forth a body, but one conceived of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; a body possessing inherent reality, but with no infirmity in its nature. That body was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and indeed body, because it was born of the Virgin: but it was above the weakness of our body, because it had its beginning in a spiritual conception.</p>

<p>36. But even now that we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> what was the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Apostle, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> think to meet it by the text, <em>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sorrowful even unto death</em>.  These words, they say, prove the consciousness of natural infirmity which made Christ begin to be sorrowful. Now, first, I appeal to common intelligence: what do we mean by <em>sorrowful unto death? </em>It cannot signify the same as 'to be sorrowful because of death:' for where there is sorrow because of death, it is the death that is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the sadness. But a sadness even to death  implies that death is the finish, not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, of the sadness. If then He was sorrowful even <em>to</em> death, not <em>because of </em>death, we must enquire, whence came His sadness? He was sorrowful, not for a certain time, or for a period which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> could not determine, but even unto death. So far from His sadness being caused by His death, it was removed by it.</p>

<p>37. That we may understand what was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His sadness, let us see what precedes and follows this confession of sadness: for in the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> supper our Lord completely signified the whole <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His Passion and our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. After He had said that they should all be offended in Him , but promised that He would go before them into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> , Peter protested that though all the rest should be offended, he would remain faithful and not be offended. <span class="stiki" id="note331150"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;26:33</a></span> But the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> by His Divine Nature what should come to pass, answered that Peter would deny Him thrice: that we might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from Peter how the others were offended, since even he lapsed into so great peril to his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the triple denial. After that, He took Peter, James and John, chosen, the first two to be His <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, John to be strengthened for the proclamation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and declared that He was sorrowful unto death. Then He went before, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, saying, <em>My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet, not as I will, but as You will</em>.  He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that the cup may pass from Him, when it was certainly already before Him: for even then was being fulfilled that pouring forth of His blood of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of many. He does not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that it may not be with Him; but that it may pass away from Him. Then He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> may not be done, and wills that what He wishes to be effected, may not be granted Him. For He says, <em>Yet not as I will, but as You will: </em>signifying by His spontaneous <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the cup's removal His fellowship with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> anxiety, yet associating Himself with the decree of the Will which He shares inseparably with the Father. To show, moreover, that He does not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for Himself, and that He seeks only a conditional fulfilment of what He desires and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for, He prefaces the whole of this request with the words, <em>My Father, if it is possible</em>. Is there anything for the Father the possibility of which is uncertain? But if nothing is impossible to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, we can see on what depends this condition, <em>if it is possible</em> : for this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is immediately followed by the words, <em>And He came to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Could ye not watch one hour with Me? Watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that you enter not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>: for the spirit indeed is willing</em>,  <em>but the flesh is weak</em>.  Is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this sadness and this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> any longer doubtful? He bids them watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with Him for this purpose, that they may not enter into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>; <em>for the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak</em>. They were under the promise made in the constancy of faithful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> not to be offended, yet, through weakness of the flesh, they were to be offended. It is not, therefore, for Himself that He is sorrowful and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>: it is for those whom He exhorts to watchfulness and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, lest the cup of suffering should be their lot: lest that cup which He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> may pass away from Him, should abide with them.</p>

<p>38. And the reason He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that the cup might be removed from Him, if that were possible, was that, though with God nothing is impossible, as Christ Himself says, <em>Father, all things are possible to You</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331154"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse36">Mark&nbsp;14:36</a></span>, yet for man it is impossible to withstand the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of suffering, and only by trial can <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. Wherefore, as Man He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for men that the cup may pass away, but as God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is in unison with the Father's effectual will. He teaches what He meant by <em>If it is possible</em>, in His words to Peter, <em>Lo, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> has sought you that He might sift you as wheat: but I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for you that your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may not fail</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331155"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;22:31-32</a></span> The cup of the Lord's Passion was to be a trial for them all, and He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> the Father for Peter that his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may not fail: that when he denied through weakness, at least he might not fail of penitential sorrow, for repentance would mean that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> survived.</p>

<p>39. The Lord was sorrowful then unto death because in presence of the death, the earthquake, the darkened day, the rent veil, the opened graves, and the resurrection of the dead, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> would need to be established which had been so shaken by the terror of the night arrest, the scourging, the striking, the spitting upon, the crown of thorns, the bearing of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and all the insults of the Passion, but most of all by the condemnation to the accursed cross. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> that all this would be at an end after His Passion, He was sad unto death. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, too, that the cup could not pass away unless He drank it, for He said, <em>My Father, this cup cannot pass from Me unless I drink it: Your will be done</em> : that is, with the completion of His Passion, the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the cup would pass away which could not pass away unless He drank it: the end of that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> would follow only when His Passion was completed and terror destroyed , because after His death, the stumbling-block of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples'</a> weakness would be removed by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His power.</p>

<p>40. Although by His words, <em>Your will be done</em>, He surrendered the Apostles to the decision of His Father's will, in regard to the offense of the cup, that is, of His Passion, still He repeated His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> a second and a third time. After that He said, <em>Sleep on now, and take your rest</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331158"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;26:45</a></span> It is not without the consciousness of some secret reason that He Who had reproached them for their sleep, now bade them sleep on, and take their rest. Luke is thought to have given us the meaning of this command. After He had told us how <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> had sought to sift the Apostles as it were wheat, and how the Lord had been entreated that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Peter might not fail , he adds that the Lord <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> earnestly, and then that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> stood by Him comforting Him, and as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> stood by Him, He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> the more earnestly, so that the sweat poured from His body in drops of blood.  The Angel was sent, then, to watch over the Apostles, and when the Lord was comforted by him, so that He no longer sorrowed for them, He said, without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of sadness, <em>Sleep on now, and take your rest</em>. Matthew and Mark are silent about the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and the request of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: but after the sorrowfulness of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the reproach of the sleepers, and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that the cup may be taken away, there must be some good reason for the command to the sleepers which follows; unless we assume that He Who was about to leave them, and Himself had received comfort from the Angel sent to Him, meant to abandon them to their sleep, soon to be arrested and kept in durance.</p>

<p>41. We must not indeed pass over the fact that in many manuscripts, both Latin and Greek, nothing is said of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> coming or the Bloody Sweat. But while we suspend judgment, whether this is an omission, where it is wanting, or an interpolation, where it is found (for the discordance of the copies leaves the question uncertain), let not the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> encourage themselves that herein lies a confirmation of His weakness, that He needed the help and comfort of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Let them remember the Creator of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> needs not the support of His creatures. Moreover His comforting must be explained in the same way as His sorrow. He was sorrowful for us, that is, on our account; He must also have been comforted for us, that is, on our account. If He sorrowed concerning us, He was comforted concerning us. The object of His comfort is the same as that of His sadness. Nor let any one dare to impute the Sweat to a weakness, for it is contrary to nature to sweat blood.  It was no infirmity, for His power reversed the law of nature. The bloody sweat does not for one moment support the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of weakness, while it establishes against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which invents an apparent body , the reality all His body. Since, then, His <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> was concerning us, and His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> on our behalf, we are forced to the conclusion that all this happened on our account, for whom He feared, and for whom He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>.</p>

<p>42. Again the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> fill up what is lacking in one another: we learn some things from one, some from another, and so on, because all are the proclamation of the same spirit. Thus John, who especially brings out the working of spiritual causes in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, preserves this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the Lord for the Apostles, which all the others passed over: how He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, namely, <em>Holy Father, keep them in Your Name....while I was them I kept them in Your Name: those whom You gave Me I have kept</em>.  That <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was not for Himself but for His Apostles; nor was He sorrowful for Himself, since He bids them <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that they be not tempted; nor is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> sent to Him, for He could summon down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, if He would, twelve thousand <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <span class="stiki" id="note331164"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse53">Matthew&nbsp;26:53</a></span>; nor did He <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> because of death when He was troubled unto death. Again, He does not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that the cup may pass over Himself, but that it may pass away from Himself, though before it could pass away He must have drunk it. But, further, 'to pass away' does not mean merely 'to leave the place,' but 'not to exist any more at all:' which is shown in the language of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and Epistles: for example, <em><a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and earth shall pass away, but My word shall not perish</em> : also the Apostle says, <em>Behold the old things are passed away; they have become new</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331166"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> And again, <em>The fashion of this world shall pass away</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331167"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:31</a></span> The cup, therefore, of which He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, cannot pass away unless it be drunk; and when He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for those whom He preserved, so long as He was with them, whom He now hands over to the Father to preserve. Now that He is about to accomplish the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of death He begs the Father to guard them. The presence of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who was sent to Him (if this explanation be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>) is not of doubtful significance. Jesus showed His certainty that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was answered when, at its close, He bade the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> sleep on. The effect of this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the security which prompted the command, 'sleep on,' is noticed by the Evangelist in the course of the Passion, when he says of the Apostles just before they escaped from the hands of the pursuers, <em>That the word might be fulfilled which He had spoken, Of those whom You have given Me I lost not one of them</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331168"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;18:9</a></span> He fulfils Himself the petition of His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and they are all safe; but He asks that those whom He has preserved the Father will now preserve in His own Name. And they are preserved: the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Peter does not fail: it cowered, but repentance followed immediately.</p>

<p>43. Combine the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a> in John, the request of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in Luke, the sorrowfulness unto death, and the protest against sleep, followed by the command, <em>Sleep on</em>, in Matthew and Mark, and all difficulty disappears. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in John, in which He commends the Apostles to His Father, explains the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His sorrowfulness, and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that the cup may pass away. It is not from Himself that the Lord <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> the suffering may be taken away. He beseeches the Father to preserve the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> during His coming passion. In the same way, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> against <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>  in St. Luke explains the confidence with which He permitted the sleep He had just forbidden.</p>

<p>44. There was, then, no place for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> anxiety and trepidation in that nature, which was more than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. It was superior to the ills of earthly flesh; a body not sprung from earthly elements, although His origin as <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> was due to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the conception by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. The power of the Most High imparted its power to the body which the Virgin bare from the conception of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. The animated body derives its conscious <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from association with a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is diffused throughout it, and quickens it to perceive pains inflicted from without. Thus the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, warned by the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> glow of its own heavenly <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope, soars above its own origin in the beginnings of an earthly body, and raises  that body to union with itself in thought and spirit, so that it ceases to feel the suffering of that which, all the while, it suffers. Why need we then say more about the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Lord's body, that of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> Who came down from heaven? Even earthly bodies can sometimes be made indifferent to the natural necessities of pain and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</p>

<p>45. Did the Jewish children <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the flames blazing up with the fuel cast upon them in the fiery furnace at <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>? Did the terror of that terrible fire prevail over their nature, conceived though it was like ours <span class="stiki" id="note331171"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse23">Daniel&nbsp;3:23</a></span>? Did they feel pain, when the flames surrounded them? Perhaps, however, you may say they felt no pain, because they were not burnt: the flames were deprived of their burning nature. To be sure it is natural to the body to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> burning, and to be burnt by fire. But through the spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> their earthly bodies (that is, bodies which had their origin according to the principles of natural birth) could neither be burnt nor made afraid. What, therefore, in the case of men was a violation of the order of nature, produced by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot be judged in God's case natural, but as an activity of the Spirit commencing with His earthly origin. The children were bound in the midst of the fire; they had no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> as they mounted the blazing pile: they felt not the flame as they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>: though in the midst of the furnace, they could not be burnt. Both the fire and their bodies lost their proper natures; the one did not burn, the others were not burnt. Yet in all other respects, both fire and bodies retained their natures: for the bystanders were consumed, and the ministers of punishment were themselves punished. Impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, you will have it that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered pain from the piercing of the nails, that He felt the bitterness of the wound, when they were driven through His hands: why, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, did not the children <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the flames? Why did they suffer no pain? What was the nature in their bodies, which overcame that of fire? In the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of a blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> they forgot to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the terrible; should Christ be sorrowful from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, Christ, Who even if He had been conceived with our sinful origin, would have been still God upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, Who was to judge the world and reign for ever and ever? Could He forget such a reward, and tremble with the anxiety of dishonourable <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>?</p>

<p>46. Daniel, whose meat was the scanty portion of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <span class="stiki" id="note331172"><a href="../bible/dan001.htm#verse8">Daniel&nbsp;1:8-16</a></span>, did not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the lions' den. The Apostles rejoiced in suffering and death for the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. To <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> his <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> was the crown of righteousness. <span class="stiki" id="note331173"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:6,&nbsp;8</a></span> The Martyrs sang <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> as they offered their necks to the executioner, and climbed with psalms the blazing logs piled for them. The consciousness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> takes away the weakness of nature, transforms the bodily senses that they feel no pain, and so the body is strengthened by the fixed purpose of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and feels nothing except the impulse of its enthusiasm. The suffering which the mind despises in its desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the body does not feel, so long as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> invigorates it. It is, then, a natural effect in man, that the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> glowing for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> should make him unconscious of suffering, heedless of wounds, and regardless of death. But <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the hem of Whose garment can heal, Whose spittle and word can create; for the man with the withered hand at His command stretched it forth whole, he who was born blind felt no more the defect of his birth, and the smitten ear was made sound as the other; dare we think of His pierced body in that pain and weakness, from which the spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him rescued the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and blessed Martyrs?</p>

<p>47. The Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, suffered in His person the attacks of all the infirmities to which we are subject; but He suffered them in the power of His own nature, just as He was born in the power of His own nature, for at His birth He did not lose His <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> nature by being born. Though born under <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conditions, He was not so conceived: His birth was surrounded by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> circumstances, but His origin went beyond them. He suffered then in His body after the manner of our infirm body, yet bore the sufferings of our body in the power of His own body. To this article of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> when he says, <em>He bears our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and grieves for us: and we esteemed Him stricken, smitten, and afflicted: He was wounded for our transgressions and made weak for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></em>.  It is then a mistaken opinion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment, which thinks He felt pain because He suffered. He bore our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that is, He assumed our body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but was Himself sinless. He was sent in the likeness of the flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, bearing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> indeed in His flesh but <em>our </em><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. So too He felt pain for us, but not with our senses; He was found in fashion as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, with a body which could feel pain, but His nature could not feel pain; for, though His fashion was that of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, His origin was not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but He was born by conception of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</p>

<p>For the reasons mentioned, He was esteemed 'stricken, smitten and afflicted.' He took the form of a servant: and 'man born of a Virgin' conveys to us the idea of One Whose nature felt pain when He suffered. But though He was wounded it was 'for our transgressions.' The wound was not the wound of His own transgressions: the suffering not a suffering for Himself. He was not born man for His own sake, nor did He transgress in His own action. The Apostle explains the principle of the Divine Plan when he says, <em>We beseech you through Christ to be reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Him, Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He made to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on our behalf</em>.  To condemn <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh, He Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was Himself made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; that is, by means of the flesh to condemn <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh, He became flesh on our behalf but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not flesh : and therefore was wounded because of our transgressions.</p>

<p>48. Again, the Apostle <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing in Christ about <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of pain. When He wishes to speak of the dispensation of the Passion, He includes it in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Divinity. <em>Forgiving us all our trespasses, blotting out the bond written in ordinances, that was against us, which was contrary to us: taking it away, and nailing it to the cross; stripping off from Himself His flesh, He made a show of principalities and powers openly triumphing over them in Himself</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331177"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse13">Colossians&nbsp;2:13-15</a></span> Was that the power, think you, to yield to the wound of the nail, to wince under the piercing blow, to convert itself into a nature that can feel pain? Yet the Apostle, who speaks as the mouthpiece of Christ <span class="stiki" id="note331178"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:3</a></span>, relating the work of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through the Lord, describes the death of Christ as 'stripping off from Himself His flesh, boldly putting to shame the powers and triumphing over them in Himself.' If His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> was a necessity of nature and not the free gift of your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: if the cross was merely the suffering of wounds, and not the fixing upon Himself of the decree of death made out against you: if His dying was a <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> done by death, and not the stripping off of the flesh by the power of God: lastly, if His death itself was anything but a dishonouring of powers, an act of boldness, a triumph: then ascribe to Him infirmity, because He was therein subject to necessity and nature, to force, to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and disgrace. But if it is the exact opposite in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Passion, as it was preached to us, who, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, can be so senseless as to repudiate the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> taught by the Apostles, to reverse all feelings of religion, to distort into the dishonourable charge of natural weakness, what was an act of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, a display of power and boldness, a triumph? And what a triumph it was, when He offered Himself to those who sought to crucify Him, and they could not endure His presence: when He stood under sentence of death, Who shortly was to sit on the right hand of power: when He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for His persecutors while the nails were driven through Him: when He completed the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> as He drained the draught of vinegar; when He was numbered among the transgressors and meanwhile granted Paradise: that when He was lifted on the tree, the earth quaked: when He hung on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, sun and day were put to flight: that He left His own body, yet called life back to the bodies of others : was buried a corpse and rose again God: as man suffered all weaknesses for our sakes, as God triumphed in them all.</p>

<p>49. There is still, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> say, another serious and far reaching confession of weakness, all the more so because it is in the mouth of the Lord Himself, <em>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have You forsaken Me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331180"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;27:46</a></span>? They construe this into the expression of a bitter complaint, that He was deserted and given over to weakness. But what a violent interpretation of an irreligious mind! How repugnant to the whole tenor of our Lord's words! He hastened to the death, which was to glorify Him, and after which He was to sit on the right hand of power; with all those blessed expectations could He <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> death, and therefore complain that His God had betrayed Him to its necessity, when it was the entrance to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessedness?</p>

<p>50. Further their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> ingenuity presses on in the path prepared by their own godlessness, even to the entire absorption of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> into the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and consequent denial that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, was the same as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. So either <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> ceased to be Himself while He performed the function of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in giving life to a body , or the man who was born was not the Christ at all, but the Word dwelt in him, as the Spirit dwelt in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.  These absurd and perverse <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> have grown in boldness and godlessness till they assert that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was not Christ until He was born of Mary. He Who was born was not a pre-existent Being, but began at that moment to exist. </p>

<p>Hence follows also the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, as it were some part of the Divine power extending itself in unbroken continuation, dwelt within that man who received from Mary the beginning of his being, and endowed him with the power of Divine working: though that man lived and moved by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. </p>

<p>51. Through this subtle and mischievous doctrine they are drawn into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> became <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the body, His nature by self-humiliation working the change upon itself, and thus the Word ceased to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; or else, that the Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, in the poverty and remoteness from God of His nature, was animated only by the life and motion of His own <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, wherein the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, that is, as it were, the might of His uttered voice, resided. Thus the way is opened for all manner of irreverent theorising: the sum of which is, either that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was merged in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and ceased to be God: or that Christ had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> before His birth from Mary, since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, a mere man of ordinary body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, began to exist only at His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> birth and was raised to the level of the Power, which worked within Him, by the extraneous force of the Divine Word extending itself into Him. Then when <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, after this extension, was withdrawn, He cried, <em>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have You forsaken Me? </em>or at least when the divine nature of the Word once more gave place within Him to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, He Who had hitherto relied on His Father's help, now separated from it, and abandoned to death, bemoaned His solitude and chid His deserter. Thus in every way arises a deadly danger of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in belief, whether it be thought that the cry of complaint denotes a weakness of nature in <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, or that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was not pre-existent because the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> from Mary was the beginning of His being.</p>

<p>52. Amid these irreverent and ill-grounded theories the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, inspired by the teaching of the Apostles, has recognised a birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but no beginning. It <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of the dispensation, but of no division : it refuses to make a separation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> ; whereby Jesus is one and Christ another; nor does it distinguish the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, lest perhaps the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> be not regarded as <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> also. It does not absorb the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>; nor does it by a tripartite belief  tear asunder Christ, Whose coat woven from the top throughout was not parted, dividing <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> into the Word, a body and a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; nor, on the other hand, does it absorb the Word in body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. To it He is perfectly <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, and perfectly Christ the Man. To this alone we hold fast in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our confession, namely, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is none other than <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and the doctrine that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is none other than Christ.</p>

<p>53. I am not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> how much the grandeur of the divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> baffles our weak understanding, so that language can scarcely express it, or reason define it, or thought even embrace it. The Apostle, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the most difficult task for an earthly nature is to apprehend, unaided, God's mode of action (for then our judgment were keener to discern than God is mighty to effect), writes to his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> son according to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who had received the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> from his childhood, <em>As I exhorted you to tarry at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that you might charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine, neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, the which minister questionings, rather than the edification of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331188"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:3-4</a></span> He bids him forbear to handle wordy genealogies and fables, which minister endless questionings. The edification of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he says, is in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: he limits <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reverence to the faithful worship of the Almighty, and does not suffer our weakness to strain itself in the attempt to see what only dazzles the eye. If we look at the brightness of the sun, the sight is strained and weakened: and sometimes when we scrutinise with too curious gaze the source of the shining light, the eyes lose their natural power, and the sense of sight is even destroyed. Thus it happens that through trying to see too much we see nothing at all. What must we then expect in the case of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Sun of Righteousness? Will not foolishness be their reward, who would be over wise? Will not dull and brainless stupor usurp the place of the burning light of intelligence? A lower nature cannot understand the principle of a higher: nor can <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven's</a> mode of thought be revealed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conception, for whatever is within the range of a limited consciousness,  is itself limited. The divine power exceeds therefore the capacity of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind. If the limited strains itself to reach so far, it becomes even feebler than before. It loses what certainty it had: instead of seeing heavenly things it is only blinded by them. No mind can fully comprehend the divine: it punishes the obstinacy of the curious by depriving them of their power. Would we look at the sun we must remove as much of his brilliancy as we need, in order to see him: if not, by expecting too much, we fall short of the possible. In the same way we can only hope to understand the purposes of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, so far as is permitted. We must expect only what He grants to our apprehension: if we attempt to go beyond the limit of His indulgence, it is withdrawn altogether. There is that in God which we <em>can</em> perceive: it is visible to all if we are content with the possible. Just as with the sun we can see something, if we are content to see what can be seen, but if we strain beyond the possible we lose all: so is it with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. There is that which we <em>can </em>understand if we are content with understanding what we can: but aim beyond your powers and you will lose even the power of attaining what was within your reach.</p>

<p>54. The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of that other timeless birth I will not yet touch upon: its treatment demands an ampler space than this. For the present I will speak of the Incarnation only. Tell me, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, you who pry into secrets of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Christ born of a Virgin and His nature; whence will you explain that He was conceived and born of a Virgin? What was the physical <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His origin according to your disputations? How was He formed within His mother's womb? Whence His body and His humanity? And lastly, what does it mean that the <em><a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> descended from heaven Who remained in heaven</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331189"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;3:13</a></span>? It is not possible by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of bodies for the same object to remain and to descend: the one is the change of downward motion; the other the stillness of being at rest. The Infant wails but is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>: the Boy grows but remains ever the immeasurable God. By what perception of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> understanding can we comprehend that He ascended where He was before, and He descended Who remained in heaven? The Lord says, <em>What if you should behold the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> ascending there where He was before</em>  <em>? </em>The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> ascends where He was before: can sense apprehend this? The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> descends from heaven, Who is in heaven: can reason cope with this? The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>: can words express this? The Word becomes flesh, that is, God becomes Man: the Man is in heaven: the God is from heaven. He ascends Who descended: but He descends and yet does not descend. He is as He ever was, yet He was not ever what He is. We pass in review the causes, but we cannot explain the manner: we perceive the manner, and we cannot understand the causes. Yet if we understand Christ Jesus even thus, we shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him: if we seek to understand Him further we shall not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him at all.</p>

<p>55. Again, how great a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of word and act it is that Christ wept, that His eyes filled with tears from the anguish of His mind. <span class="stiki" id="note331191"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;19:41</a></span> Whence came this defect in His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that sorrow should wring tears from His body? What bitter <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, what unendurable pain, could move to a flood of tears the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> Who descended from heaven? Again, what was it in Him which wept? <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>? Or His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? For though weeping is a bodily function, the body is but a servant; tears are, as it were, the sweat of the agonised <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Again, what was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His weeping? Did He owe to Jerusalem the debt of His tears, Jerusalem, the godless parricide, whom no suffering could requite for the slaughter of Apostles and Prophets, and the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of her Lord Himself? He might weep for the disasters and death which befall <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>: but could He grieve for the fall of that doomed and desperate race? What, I ask, was this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of weeping? His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> wept for sorrow; was not it the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which sent forth the Prophets? Which would so often have gathered the chickens together under the shadow of His wings ? But <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> cannot grieve, nor can the Spirit weep: nor could His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> possibly do anything before the body <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. Yet we cannot <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> wept. </p>

<p>56. No less real were the tears He shed for Lazarus. <span class="stiki" id="note331194"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;11:35</a></span> The first question here is, What was there to weep for in the case of Lazarus? Not his death, for that was not unto death, but for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God: for the Lord says, <em>That sickness is not unto death, but for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> may be honoured through him</em>.  The death which was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of God's being <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> could not bring sorrow and tears. Nor was there any occasion for tears in His absence from Lazarus at the time of his death. He says plainly, <em>Lazarus is dead, and I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent that you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a></em>.  His absence then, which aided the Apostles' belief, was not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His sorrow: for with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine omniscience, He declared the death of the sick man from afar. We can find, then, no necessity for tears, yet He wept. And again I ask, To whom must we ascribe the weeping? To <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or the body? The body, of itself, has no tears except those it sheds at the command of the sorrowing <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Far less can God have wept, for He was to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Lazarus. Nor is it reason to say His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> recalled Lazarus from the tomb: can a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> linked to a body, by the power of its command, call another <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> back to the dead body from which it has departed? Can He grieve Who is about to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>? Can He weep Who is about to restore the dead to life? Tears are not for Him Who is about to give life, or grief for Him Who is about to receive <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Yet He Who wept and grieved was also the Giver of life.</p>

<p>57. If there are many points which we treat scantily it is not because we have nothing to say, or do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what has already been said; our purpose is, by abstaining from too laborious a process of argument, to render the results as attractive as possible to the reader. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and words of our Lord, yet we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them not: we are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of them, yet they cannot be understood. The facts are real, but the power behind them is a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. We will prove this from His own words, <em>For this reason does the Father <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it up again. No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it up again. This commandment received I from the Father</em>.  He lays down His life of Himself, but I ask <em>who </em>lays it down? We confess without hesitation, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>: but on the other hand, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> was composed of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and a body: compare the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> words to Joseph, <em>Arise and take the child and His mother, and go into the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; for they are dead who sought the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the child</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331198"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;2:20</a></span> Whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is it? His body's, or God's? If His body's, what power has the body to lay down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when it is only by the working of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that it is quickened into life? Again, how could the body, which apart from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is inert and dead, receive a command from the Father? But if, on the other hand, any man suppose that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> laid aside His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that He might take it up again, he must prove that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> died, that is, remained without life and feeling like a dead body, and took up His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> again to be quickened once more into life by it.</p>

<p>58. But, further, no one who is endued with reason can impute to God a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; though it is written in many places that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of God <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> sabbaths and new moons: and also that it delights in certain things.  But this is merely a conventional expression to be understood in the same way as when God is spoken of as possessing body, with hands, and eyes, and fingers, and arms, and heart. As the Lord said, <em>A Spirit has not flesh and bones</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331200"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;24:39</a></span>: He then Who <em>is, and changes not</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331201"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse6">Malachi&nbsp;3:6</a></span>, cannot have the limbs and parts of a tangible body. He is a simple and blessed nature, a single, complete, all-embracing Whole. God is therefore not quickened into life, like bodies, by the action of an indwelling <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but is Himself His own life.</p>

<p>59. How does He then lay down His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or take it up again? What is the meaning of this command He received? God could not lay it down, that is, die, or take it up again, that is, come to life. But neither did the body receive the command to take it up again; it could not do so of itself, for He said of the Temple of His body, <em>Destroy this temple and after three days I will raise it up</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331202"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;2:19</a></span> Thus it is God Who raises up the temple of His body. And Who lays down His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to take it again? The body does not take it up again of itself: it is raised up by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. That which is raised up again must have been dead, and that which is living does not lay down its <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. God then was neither dead nor buried: and yet He said, <em>In that she has poured this ointment upon My body she did it for My burial</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331203"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;26:12</a></span> In that it was poured upon His body it was done for His burial: but the <em>His </em>is not the same as <em>Him</em>. It is quite another use of the pronoun when we say, 'it was done for the burial of <em>Him</em>,' and when we say, ' <em>His </em>body was anointed.' nor is the sense the same in ' <em>His</em> body was buried,' and ' <em>He </em>was buried.'</p>

<p>60. To grasp this divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> we must see the God in Him without ignoring the Man; and the Man without ignoring the God. We must not divide <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>: yet we must not call Him buried, though we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> He raised Himself again: must not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, though we dare not deny He was buried.  <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was buried, for He died: He died, and even cried out at the moment of death, <em>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have You forsaken Me? </em>Yet He, Who uttered these words, said also: <em>Verily I say unto you, This day shall you be with Me in Paradise</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331205"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;23:43</a></span>, and He Who promised Paradise to the thief cried aloud, <em>Father, into Your hands I commend My Spirit; and having said this He gave up the Ghost</em>. </p>

<p>61. You who trisect Christ into the Word, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the body, or degrade the whole Christ, even <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, into a single member of our race, unfold to us this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of great godliness which was manifested in the flesh. <span class="stiki" id="note331207"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:16</a></span> What Spirit did Christ give up? Who commended His Spirit into the hands of His Father? Who was to be in Paradise that same day? Who complained that He was deserted of God? The cry of the deserted betokens the weakness of the dying: the promise of Paradise the sovereign power of the living God. To commend His Spirit denoted confidence: to give up His Spirit implied His departure by death. Who then, I demand, was it Who died? Surely He Who gave up His Spirit? But Who gave up His Spirit? Certainly He Who commended it to His Father. And if He Who commended His Spirit is the same as He Who gave it up and died, was it the body which commended its <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or God Who commended the body's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? I say '<a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,' because there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it is frequently synonymous with 'spirit,' as might be gathered merely from the language here: Jesus gave up His 'Spirit' when He was on the point of death. If, therefore, you hold the conviction that the body commended the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that the perishable commended the living, the corruptible the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that which was to be raised again, that which abides unchanged, then, since He Who commended His Spirit to the Father was also to be in Paradise with the thief that same day, I would fain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> if, while the sepulchre received Him, He was abiding in heaven, or if He was abiding in heaven, when He cried out that God had deserted Him.</p>

<p>62. It is one and the same Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Word made flesh, Who expresses Himself in all these utterances, Who is man when He says He is abandoned to death: yet while man still rules in Paradise as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and though reigning in Paradise, as <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> commends His Spirit to His Father, as <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> gives up to death the Spirit He commended to the Father. Why do we then view as a disgrace that which is a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>? We see Him complaining that He is left to die, because He is Man: we see Him, as He dies, declaring that He reigned in Paradise, because He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Why should we harp, to support our irreverence, on what He said to make us understand His death, and keep back what He proclaimed to demonstrate His <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>? The words and the voice are equally His, when He complains of desertion, and when He declares His rule: by what method of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> logic do we split up our belief and deny that He Who died was at the same time He Who rules? Did He not testify both equally of Himself, when He commended His Spirit, and when He gave it up? But if He is the same, Who commended His Spirit, and gave it up, if He dies when ruling and rules when dead: then the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> means that He is One, Who dying reigns, and reigning dies.</p>

<p>63. Stand aside then, all godless unbelievers, for whom the divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is too great, who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Christ wept not for Himself but for us, to prove the reality of His assumed manhood by yielding to the emotion common to humanity: who do not perceive that Christ died not for Himself, but for our life, to renew <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life by the death of the deathless God: who cannot reconcile the complaint of the deserted with the confidence of the Ruler: who would teach us that because He reigns as God and complains that He is dying, we have here a dead man and the reigning God. For He Who dies is none other than He Who reigns, He Who commends His spirit than He Who gives it up: He Who was buried, rose again: ascending or descending He is altogether one.</p>

<p>64. Listen to the teaching of the Apostle and see in it a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> instructed not by the understanding of the flesh but by the gift of the Spirit. <em>The Greeks seek after wisdom, he says, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> ask for a sign; but we preach Christ crucified, to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a stumbling block, and unto <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> foolishness; but unto them that are called, both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331208"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:23-24</a></span> Is Christ divided here so that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the crucified is one, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the power and wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, another? This is to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a stumbling-block and unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> foolishness; but to us Christ Jesus is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the wisdom of God: wisdom, however, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of the world, nor understood by a secular <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Hear the same blessed Apostle when he declares that it has not been understood, <em>We speak the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which has been hidden in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foreordained before the world for our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: which none of the rulers of this world has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: for had they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331209"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:7-8</a></span> Does not the Apostle <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this wisdom of God is hidden in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, and cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of the rulers of this world? Does he divide Christ into a Lord of Glory and a crucified Jesus? Nay, rather, he contradicts this most foolish and impious idea with the words, <em>For I determined to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing among you, save <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and Him crucified</em>. </p>

<p>65. The Apostle <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing else, and he determined to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing else: we men of feebler wit, and feebler <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, split up, divide and double <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, constituting ourselves judges of the unknown, and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> the hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. For us Christ crucified is one, Christ the wisdom of God another: Christ Who was buried different from Christ Who descended from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>: the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> not at the same time also <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. We teach that which we do not understand: we seek to refute that which we cannot grasp. We men improve upon the revelation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: we are not content to say with the Apostle, <em>Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies, who is he that condemns? It is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, that died, yea, rather, that was raised from the dead, Who is at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who also makes intercession for us</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331211"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse33">Romans&nbsp;8:33-34</a></span> Is He Who intercedes for us other than He Who is at the right hand of God? Is not He Who is at the right hand of God the very same Who rose again? Is He Who rose again other than He Who died? He Who died than He Who condemns us? Lastly, is not He Who condemns us also God Who justifies us? Distinguish, if you can, Christ our accuser from God our defender, Christ Who died from Christ Who condemns, Christ sitting at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for us from Christ Who died. Whether, therefore, dead or buried, descended into Hades or ascended into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, all is one and the same Christ: as the Apostle says, <em>Now this 'He ascended' what is it, but that He also descended to the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all heavens, that He may fill all things</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331212"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse9">Ephesians&nbsp;4:9-10</a></span> How far then shall we push our babbling <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, professing to explain what is hidden in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of God? <em>He that descended is the same also that ascended</em>. Can we longer <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the Man Christ Jesus rose from the dead, ascended above the heavens and is at the right hand of God? We cannot say His body descended into Hades, which lay in the grave. If then He Who descended is one with Him, Who ascended; if His body did not go down into Hades, yet really arose from the dead, and ascended into heaven, what remains, except to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the secret <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, which is hidden from the world and the rulers of this age, and to confess that, ascending or descending, He is but One, one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> for us, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> and Man in the flesh, Who suffered, died, was buried, rose again, was received into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God: Who possesses in His one single self, according to the Divine Plan and nature, in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and in the form of a servant, the Human and Divine without separation or division.</p>

<p>66. So the Apostle moulding our <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and haphazard ideas into conformity with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> says of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <em>For He was crucified through weakness but He lives through the power of God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331213"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:4</a></span> Preaching the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> and <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Man through the Divine Plan, God through His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> nature, he says, that He Who was crucified through weakness is He Who lives through the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. His weakness arises from <em>the form of a servant</em>, His nature remains because of the <em>form of God</em>. He took the form of a servant, though He was in form of God: therefore there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> according to which He both suffered and lived. There <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in Him both weakness to suffer, and power of God to give life: and hence He Who suffered and lived cannot be more than One, or other than Himself.</p>

<p>67. The Only-begotten God suffered indeed all that men can suffer: but let us express ourselves in the words and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Apostle. He says, <em>For I delivered unto you first of all how that Christ died for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a></em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331214"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:3-4</a></span> This is no unsupported statement of his own, which might lead to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but a warning to us to confess that Christ died and rose after a real manner, not a nominal, since the fact is certified by the full weight of Scripture authority; and that we must understand His death in that exact sense in which Scripture declares it. In his regard for the perplexities and scruples of the weak and sensitive believer, he adds these solemn concluding words, <em>according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, </em>to his proclamation of the death and the resurrection. He would not have us grow weaker, driven about by every wind of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">vain doctrine</a>, or vexed by empty subtleties and false doubts: he would summon <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to return, before it were shipwrecked, to the haven of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, believing and confessing the death and resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> and <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, <em>according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a></em>, this being the safeguard of reverence against the attack of the adversary, so to understand the death and resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, as it was written of Him. There is no danger in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: the reverent confession of the hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of God is always safe. Christ was born of the Virgin, but conceived of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> <em>according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a></em>. Christ wept, but <em>according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>: </em>that which made Him weep was also a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Christ hungered; but <em>according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a></em>, He used His power as God against the tree which bore no fruit, when He had no food. Christ suffered: but <em>according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, </em>He was about to sit at the right hand of Power. He complained that He was abandoned to die: but <em>according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a></em>, at the same moment He received in His kingdom in Paradise the thief who confessed Him. He died: but <em>according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a></em>, He rose again and sits at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In the belief of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> there is life: this confession resists all attack.</p>

<p>68. The Apostle is careful to leave no room for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>: we cannot say, <q>Christ was born, suffered, was dead and buried, and rose again: but how, by what power, by what division of parts of Himself? Who wept? Who rejoiced? Who complained? Who descended? And Who ascended?</q> He rests the merits of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> entirely on the confession of unquestioning reverence. <em>The righteousness</em>, he says, <em>which is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> says thus, Say not in your heart, Who has ascended into heaven, that is, to bring Christ down: or Who has descended into the abyss: that is, to bring Christ up from the dead? But what says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>? Your word is near, in your mouth, and in your heart; that is, the word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which we preach: because if you shall confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in your heart, that God has raised Him up from the dead, you shall be saved</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331215"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;10:6-9</a></span> Faith perfects the righteous man: as it is written, <em><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> God and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness</em>.  Did <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> impugn the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he was promised the inheritance of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and an abiding posterity as many as the sand or the stars for multitude? To the reverent <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which trusts implicitly on the omnipotence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the limits of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness are no barrier. Despising all that is feeble and earthly in itself, it believes the divine promise, even though it exceeds the possibilities of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. It <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which govern man are no hindrance to the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is as bountiful in the performance as He is gracious in the promise. Nothing is more righteous than Faith. For as in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conduct it is equity and self-restraint that receive our approval, so in the case of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what is more righteous for man than to ascribe omnipotence to Him, Whose Power He perceives to be without limits?</p>

<p>69. The Apostle then looking in us for the righteousness which is of Faith, cuts at the root of incredulous <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and godless unbelief. He forbids us to admit into our hearts the cares of anxious thought, and points to the authority of the Prophet's words, <em>Say not in your heart, Who has ascended into heaven</em>  <em>?</em> Then He completes the thought of the Prophet's words with the addition, <em>That is to bring Christ down</em>. The perception of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind cannot attain to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the divine: but neither can a reverent <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Christ needed no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> help, that any one should ascend into heaven to bring Him down from His blessed Home to His earthly body. It was no external force which drove Him down to the earth. We must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He came, even as He did come: it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion to confess <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> not brought down, but descending. The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> both of the time and the method of His coming, belongs to Him alone. We may not think because He came but recently, that therefore He must have been brought down, nor that His coming in time depended upon another, who brought Him down.</p>

<p>Nor does the Apostle give room for unbelief in the other direction. He quotes at once the words of the Prophet, <em>Or Who has descended into the abyss</em> , and adds immediately the explanation, <em>That is to bring Christ back from the dead</em>. He is free to return into heaven, Who was free to descend to the earth. All hesitation and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is then removed. Faith reveals what omnipotence plans: history  relates the effect, God Almighty was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.</p>

<p>70. But there is demanded from us an unwavering certainty. The Apostle expounding the whole secret of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> passes on, <em>Your word is near, in your mouth and in your heart</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note331219"><a href="../bible/deu030.htm#verse14">Deuteronomy&nbsp;30:14</a></span> The words of our confession must not be tardy or deliberately vague: there must be no interval between heart and lips, lest what ought to be the confession of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reverence become a subterfuge of infidelity. The word must be near us, and within us; no delay between the heart and the lips; a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of conviction as well as of words. Heart and lips must be in harmony, and reveal in thought and utterance a religion which does not waver. Here too, as before, the Apostle adds the explanation of the Prophet's words, <em>That is the word of Faith, which we preach; because if you shall confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in your heart that God has raised Him up from the dead, you shall be saved</em>. Piety consists in rejecting <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, righteousness in believing, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in confessing. Trifle not with ambiguities, be not stirred up to vain babblings, do not debate in any way the powers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or impose limits upon His might, cease searching again and again for the causes of unsearchable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>: confess rather that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Lord, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God raised Him from the dead; herein is <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. What folly is it to depreciate the nature and character of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when this alone is <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He is the Lord. Again, what an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> vanity to quarrel about His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, when it is enough for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God raised Him up. In simplicity then is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> righteousness, and in confession <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> godliness. For God does not call us to the blessed life through arduous investigations. He does not tempt us with the varied arts of rhetoric. The way to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is plain and easy; <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was raised from the dead by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and confess that He is the Lord. Let no one therefore wrest into an occasion for impiety, what was said because of our <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. It had to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to us, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> died, that we might live in Him.</p>

<p>71. If then He said, <em>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have You forsaken Me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331220"><a href="../bible/mar015.htm#verse34">Mark&nbsp;15:34</a></span>, and <em>Father, into Your hands I commend My Spirit</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331221"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;23:46</a></span>, that we might be sure that He did die, was not this, in His care for our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, rather a scattering of our doubts, than a confession of His weakness? When He was about to restore Lazarus, He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the Father: but what need had He of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, Who said, Father, <em>I thank You, that You have heard Me; and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that You hear Me always, but because of the multitude I said it, that they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that You sent Me</em> <span class="stiki" id="note331222"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse41">John&nbsp;11:41-42</a></span> <em>? </em>He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> then for us, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him to be the Son; the words of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> availed Him nothing, but He said them for the advancement of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He was not in want of help, but we of teaching. Again He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>; and immediately was heard from heaven the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father glorifying Him: but when they wondered at the voice, He said, <em>This voice has not come for My sake, but for your sakes</em>.  The Father is besought for us, He speaks for us: may all this lead us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and confess! The answer of the Glorifier is granted not to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the bystanders: must we not then regard the complaint of suffering, when He found His greatest <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in suffering, as intended for the building up of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Christ <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for His persecutors, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what they did. He promised Paradise from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, because He is God the King. He rejoiced upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, that all was finished when He drank the vinegar, because He had fulfilled all <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> before He died. He was born for us, suffered for us, died for us, rose again for us. This alone is necessary for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, to confess the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> risen from the dead: why then should we die in this state of godless unbelief? If Christ, ever secure of His divinity, made clear to us His death, Himself indifferent to death, yet dying to assure that it was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> humanity that He had assumed: why should we use this very confession of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> that for us He became <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> and died as the chief weapon to deny His divinity?</p>
