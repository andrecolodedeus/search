<h1>Oration 2</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">It is generally agreed that this oration was not intended for oral delivery. Its object was to explain and defend S. Gregory's recent conduct, which had been severely criticised by his friends at Nazianzus. He had been recalled by his father probably during the year A.D.. 361 from <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, where he had spent several years in monastic seclusion with his friend S. Basil. His father, not content with his son's presence at home as a support for his declining years, and feeling assured of his fitness for the sacred office, had proceeded, with the loudly expressed approval of the congregation, in spite of Gregory's reluctance, to ordain him to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a> A.D. 361. S. Gregory, even after the lapse of many years, speaks of his ordination as an act of tyranny, and at the time, stung almost to <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, as an ox by a gadfly, rushed away again to <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, to bury in its congenial solitude, consoled by an intimate friend's deep sympathy, his wounded feelings. Before long the sense of duty reasserted itself, and he returned to his post at his father's side before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> A.D. 362. On <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> day he delivered his first Oration before a congregation whose scantiness marked the displeasure with which the people of Nazianzus had viewed his conduct. Accordingly he set himself to supply them in this Oration with a full explanation of the motives which had led to his retirement. At the same time, as the secondary title of the Oration shows, he has supplied an exposition of the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> and dignity of the Priestly Office which has been drawn upon by all later writers on the subject. S. Chrysostom in his well-known treatise, S. Gregory the Great in his Pastoral Care, and Bossuet in his panegyric on S. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, have done little more than summarise the material or develop the considerations contained in this eloquent and elaborate dissertation.</span> </p>

<p><strong>In Defence of His Flight to Pontus, and His Return, After His Ordination to the Priesthood, with an Exposition of the Character of the Priestly Office.</strong></p>

<p>1. I have been defeated, and own my defeat. I subjected myself to the Lord, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> unto Him.  Let the most blessed David supply my exordium, or rather let Him Who spoke in David, and even now yet speaks through him. For indeed the very best order of beginning every speech and action, is to begin from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  and to end in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, either of my original revolt and cowardice, in which I got me away far off, and remained  away from you for a time, which perhaps seemed long to those who missed me; or of the present gentleness and change of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, in which I have given myself up again to you, men may think and speak in different ways, according to the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> they bear me, on the one side refusing to acquit me of the charges alleged, on the other giving me a hearty welcome. For nothing is so pleasant to men as talking of other people's business, especially under the influence of affection or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, which often almost entirely blinds us to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. I will, however, myself, unabashed, set forth the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and arbitrate with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> between the two parties, which accuse or gallantly defend us, by, on the one side, accusing myself, on the other, undertaking my own defence.</p>

<p>2. Accordingly, that my speech may proceed in due order, I apply myself to the question which arose first, that of cowardice. For I cannot endure that any of those who watch with interest the success, or the contrary, of my efforts, should be put to confusion on my account, since it has pleased God that our affairs should be of some consequence to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, so I will by my defence relieve, if there be any such, those who have already suffered; for it is well, as far as possible, and as reason allows, to shrink from causing, through our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or suspicion, any offense or stumbling-block to the community: inasmuch as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how inevitably even those who offend one of the little ones <span class="stiki" id="note312547"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;18:6</a></span> will incur the severest punishment at the hands of Him who cannot lie.</p>

<p>3. For my present position is due, my good people, not to inexperience and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, nay indeed, that I may boast myself a little, <span class="stiki" id="note312548"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:16</a></span> neither is it due to contempt for the divine <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and ordinances. Now, just as in the body there is  one member  which rules and, so to say, presides, while another is ruled over and subject; so too in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, God has ordained, according either to a law of equality, which admits of an order of merit, or to one of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, by which He has knit all together, that those for whom such treatment is beneficial, should be subject to pastoral care and rule, and be guided by word and deed in the path of duty; while others should be pastors and teachers, <span class="stiki" id="note312551"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse11">Ephesians&nbsp;4:11</a></span> for the perfecting of the church, those, I mean, who surpass the majority in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and nearness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, performing the functions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the body, and of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; in order that both may be so united and compacted together, that, although one is lacking and another is pre-eminent, they may, like the members of our bodies, be so combined and knit together by the harmony of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as to form one perfect body,  really worthy of Christ Himself, our Head. <span class="stiki" id="note312553"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse15">Ephesians&nbsp;4:15</a></span> </p>

<p>4. I am aware then that <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>  and disorder cannot be more advantageous than order and rule, either to other creatures or to men; nay, this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of men in the highest possible degree, because the interests at stake in their case are greater; since it is a great thing  for them, even if they fail of their highest purpose&mdash; to be free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash; to attain at least to that which is second best, restoration from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Since this seems right and just, it is, I take it, equally wrong and disorderly that all should wish to rule, and that no one should accept  it. For if all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were to shirk this office, whether it must be called a ministry or a leadership, the fair fullness <span class="stiki" id="note312557"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse23">Ephesians&nbsp;1:23</a></span> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would be halting in the highest degree, and in fact cease to be fair. And further, where, and by whom would God be worshipped among us in those mystic and elevating <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> which are our greatest and most precious privilege, if there were neither king, nor governor, nor <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note312558"><a href="../bible/hos003.htm#verse4">Hosea&nbsp;3:4</a></span> nor all those highest offices to the loss of which, for their great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, men were of old condemned in consequence of their disobedience?</p>

<p>5. Nor indeed is it strange or inconsistent for the majority of those who are devoted to the study of divine things, to ascend to rule from being ruled, nor does it overstep the limits laid down by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>,  or involve disgrace; any more than for an excellent sailor to become a lookout-man, and for a lookout-man, who has successfully kept watch over the winds, to be entrusted with the helm; or, if you will, for a brave soldier to be made a captain, and a good captain to become a general, and have committed to him the conduct of the whole campaign. Nor again, as perhaps some of those absurd and tiresome people may suppose, who judge of others' feelings by their own, was I ashamed of the rank of this grade from my desire for a higher. I was not so <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> either of its divine greatness or <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> low estate, as to think it no great thing for a created nature, to approach in however slight degree to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who alone is most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and illustrious, and surpasses in purity every nature, material and immaterial alike.</p>

<p>6. What then were my feelings, and what was the reason of my disobedience? For to most men I did not at the time seem consistent with myself, or to be such as they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me, but to have undergone some deterioration, and to exhibit greater resistance and self-will than was right. And the causes of this you have long been desirous to hear. First, and most important, I was astounded at the unexpectedness of what had occurred, as people are terrified by sudden noises; and, losing the control of my reasoning faculties, my self-respect, which had hitherto controlled me, gave way. In the next place, there came over me an eager longing  for the blessings of calm and retirement, of which I had from the first been enamoured to a higher degree, I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, than any other student of letters, and which amidst the greatest and most threatening dangers I had promised to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of which I had also had so much experience, that I was then upon its threshold, my longing having in consequence been greatly kindled, so that I could not submit to be thrust into the midst of a life of turmoil by an arbitrary act of oppression, and to be torn away by force from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sanctuary of such a life as this.</p>

<p>7. For nothing seemed to me so desirable as to close the doors of my senses, and, escaping from the flesh and the world, collected within myself, having no further connection than was absolutely necessary with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, and speaking to myself and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note312561"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:28</a></span> to live superior to visible things, ever preserving in myself the divine impressions pure and unmixed with the erring tokens of this lower world, and both being, and constantly growing more and more to be, a real unspotted mirror of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and divine things, as light is added to light, and what was still dark grew clearer, enjoying already by hope the blessings of the world to come, roaming about with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, even now being above the earth by having forsaken it, and stationed on high by the Spirit. If any of you has been possessed by this longing, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what I mean and will sympathise with my feelings at that time. For, perhaps, I ought not to expect to persuade most people by what I say, since they are unhappily disposed to laugh at such things, either from their own thoughtlessness, or from the influence of men unworthy of the promise, who have bestowed upon that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> name, calling <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> nonsense, aided by <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tendencies of the mob, who are ever inclined to grow worse: so that they are constantly occupied with one of two <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, either the commission of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or the discrediting of good.</p>

<p>8. I was influenced besides by another feeling, whether base or noble I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but I will speak out to you all my secrets. I was ashamed of all those others, who, without being better than ordinary people, nay, it is a great thing if they be not worse, with unwashen hands, <span class="stiki" id="note312562"><a href="../bible/mar007.htm#verse5">Mark&nbsp;7:5</a></span> as the saying runs, and uninitiated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, intrude into the most sacred offices; and, before becoming worthy to approach the temples, they lay claim to the sanctuary,  and they push and thrust around the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> table, as if they thought this order to be a means of livelihood, instead of a pattern of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or an absolute authority, instead of a ministry of which we must give account. In fact they are almost more in number than those whom they govern; pitiable as regards <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>,  and unfortunate in their dignity; so that, it seems to me, they will not, as time and this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> alike progress, have any one left to rule, when all are teachers, instead of, as the promise says, taught of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  and all prophesy,  so that even <q>Saul is among the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>,</q>  according to the ancient history and proverb. For at no time, either now or in former days, amid the rise and fall of various developments, has there ever been such an abundance, as now exists among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, of disgrace and abuses of this kind. And, if to stay this current is beyond our powers, at any rate it is not the least important duty of religion to testify the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and shame we feel for it.</p>

<p>9. Lastly, there is a matter more serious than any which I have mentioned, for I am now coming to the finale  of the question: and I will not deceive you; for that would not be lawful in regard to topics of such moment. I did not, nor do I now, think myself qualified to rule a flock or herd, or to have authority over the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men. For in their case it is sufficient to render the herd or flock as stout and fat as possible; and with this object the neatherd and shepherd will look for well watered and rich pastures, and will drive his charge from pasture to pasture, and allow them to rest, or arouse, or recall them, sometimes with his staff, most often with his pipe; and with the exception of occasional struggles with wolves, or attention to the sickly, most of his time will be devoted to the oak and the shade and his pipes, while he reclines on the beautiful grass, and beside the cool water, and shakes down his couch in a breezy spot, and ever and anon sings a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> ditty, with his cup by his side, and talks to his bullocks or his flock, the fattest of which supply his banquets or his pay. But no one ever has thought of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of flocks or herds; for indeed of what <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are they capable? Or who has regarded their advantage as more important than his own pleasure?</p>

<p>10. But in the case of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, hard as it is for him to learn how to submit to rule, it seems far harder to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to rule over men, and hardest of all, with this rule of ours, which leads them by the divine law, and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for its risk is, in the eyes of a thoughtful man, proportionate to its height and dignity. For, first of all, he must, like silver or gold, though in general circulation in all kinds of seasons and affairs, never ring false or alloyed, or give token of any inferior matter, needing further refinement in the fire; <span class="stiki" id="note312569"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:12</a></span> or else, the wider his rule, the greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> he will be. Since the injury which extends to many is greater than that which is confined to a single individual.</p>

<p>11. For it is not so easy to dye deeply a piece of cloth, or to impregnate with odours, foul or the reverse, whatever comes near to them; nor is it so easy for the fatal vapour, which is rightly called a pestilence, to infect the air, and through the air to gain access to living being, as it is for the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of a superior to take most speedy possession of his subjects, and that with far greater facility than <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> its opposite. For it is in this that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> especially has the advantage over goodness, and most distressing it is to me to perceive it, that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is something attractive and ready at hand, and that nothing is so easy as to become <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, even without any one to lead us on to it; while the attainment of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is rare and difficult, even where there is much to attract and encourage us. And it is this, I think, which the most blessed Haggai had before his eyes, in his wonderful and most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> figure: &mdash; <q>Ask the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> concerning the law, saying: If <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> flesh borne in a garment touch meat or drink or vessel, will it sanctify what is in contact with it? And when they said No; ask again if any of these things touch what is unclean, does it not at once partake of the pollution? For they will surely tell you that it does partake of it, and does not continue clean in spite of the contact.</q></p>

<p>12. What does he mean by this? As I take it, that goodness can with difficulty gain a hold upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, like fire upon green wood; while most men are ready and disposed to join in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, like stubble,  I mean, ready for a spark and a wind, which is easily kindled and consumed from its dryness. For more quickly would any one take part in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with slight inducement to its full extent, than in good which is fully set before him to a slight degree. For indeed a little wormwood most quickly imparts its bitterness to honey; while not even double the quantity of honey can impart its sweetness to wormwood: and the withdrawal of a small pebble would draw headlong a whole river, though it would be difficult for the strongest dam to restrain or stay its course.</p>

<p>13. This then is the first point in what we have said, which it is right for us to guard against, viz.: being found to be bad painters  of the charms of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and still more, if not, perhaps, models for poor painters, poor models for the people, or barely escaping the proverb, that we undertake to heal others <span class="stiki" id="note312573"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse23">Luke&nbsp;4:23</a></span> while ourselves are full of sores.</p>

<p>14. In the second place, although a man has kept himself pure from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even in a very high degree; I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that even this is sufficient for one who is to instruct others in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For he who has received this charge, not only needs to be free from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is, in the eyes of most of those under his care, most disgraceful, but also to be eminent in good, according to the command, <q>Depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and do good.</q>  And he must not only wipe out the traces of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> from his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but also inscribe better ones, so as to outstrip men further in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than he is superior to them in dignity. He should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no limits in goodness or spiritual progress, and should dwell upon the loss of what is still beyond him, rather than the gain of what he has attained, and consider that which is beneath his feet a step to that which comes next: and not think it a great gain to excel ordinary people, but a loss to fall short of what we ought to be: and to measure his success by the commandment and not by his neighbours, whether they be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or to some extent proficient in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and to weigh <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in no small scales, inasmuch as it is due to the Most High, <q>from Whom are all things, and to Whom are all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note312575"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse35">Romans&nbsp;11:35</a></span> </p>

<p>15. Nor must he suppose that the same things are suitable to all, just as all have not the same stature, nor are the features of the face, nor the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of animals, nor the qualities of soil, nor the beauty and size of the stars, in all cases the same: but he must consider base conduct a fault in a private individual, and deserving of chastisement under the hard rule of the law; while in the case of a ruler or leader it is a fault not to attain to the highest possible excellence, and always make progress in goodness, if indeed he is, by his high degree of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to draw his people to an ordinary degree, not by the force of authority, but by the influence of persuasion. For what is involuntary apart from its being the result of oppression, is neither meritorious nor durable. For what is forced, like a plant  violently drawn aside by our hands, when set free, returns to what it was before, but that which is the result of choice is both most legitimate and enduring, for it is preserved by the bond of good will. And so our law and our lawgiver enjoin upon us most strictly that we should <q>tend the flock not by constraint but willingly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note312577"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:2</a></span> </p>

<p>16. But granted that a man is free from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and has reached the greatest heights of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: I do not see what <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or power would justify him in venturing upon this office. For the guiding of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the most variable and manifold of creatures, seems to me in very deed to be the art of arts  and science of sciences. Any one may recognize this, by comparing the work of the physician of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> with the treatment of the body; and noticing that, laborious as the latter is, ours is more laborious, and of more consequence, from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its subject matter, the power of its science, and the object of its exercise. The one labours about bodies, and perishable failing matter, which absolutely must be dissolved and undergo its <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note312579"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;3:19</a></span> even if upon this occasion by the aid of art it can surmount the disturbance within itself, being dissolved by disease or time in submission to the law of nature, since it cannot rise above its own limitations.</p>

<p>17. The other is concerned with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which comes from God and is divine, and partakes of the heavenly nobility, and presses on to it, even if it be bound to an inferior nature. Perhaps indeed there are other reasons also for this, which only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who bound them together, and those who are instructed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in such <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but as far as I, and men like myself can perceive, there are two: one, that it may inherit the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> above by means of a struggle and wrestling <span class="stiki" id="note312580"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians&nbsp;6:12</a></span> with things below, being tried as gold in the fire <span class="stiki" id="note312581"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:7</a></span> by things here, and gain the objects of our hope as a prize of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and not merely as the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This, indeed, was the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Supreme Goodness, to make the good even our own, not only because sown in our nature, but because cultivated by our own choice, and by the motions of our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>,  free to act in either direction. The second reason is, that it may draw to itself and raise to heaven the lower nature, by gradually freeing it from its grossness, in order that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be to the body what God is to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, itself leading on the matter which ministers to it, and uniting it, as its fellow-servant, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>18. Place and time and age and season and the like are the subjects of a physician's scrutiny; he will prescribe medicines and diet, and guard against things injurious, that the desires of the sick may not be a hindrance to his art. Sometimes, and in certain cases, he will make use of the cautery or the knife or the severer remedies; but none of these, laborious and hard as they may seem, is so difficult as the diagnosis and cure of our habits, <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, lives, wills, and whatever else is within us, by banishing from our compound nature everything brutal and fierce, and introducing and establishing in their stead what is gentle and dear to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and arbitrating fairly between <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; not allowing the superior to be overpowered by the inferior, which would be the greatest <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>; but subjecting to the ruling and leading power that which naturally takes the second place: as indeed the divine law enjoins, which is most excellently imposed on His whole creation, whether visible or beyond our ken.</p>

<p>19. This further point does not escape me, that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of all these objects of the watchfulness of the physician remains the same, and does not evolve out of itself any crafty opposition, or contrivance hostile to the appliances of his art, nay, it is rather the treatment which modifies its subject matter,  except where some slight insubordination occurs on the part of the patient, which it is not difficult to prevent or restrain. But in our case, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and selfishness, and the want of training and inclination to yield ready submission are a very great obstacle to advance in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, amounting almost to an armed resistance to those who are wishful to help us. And the very eagerness with which we should lay bare our sickness to our spiritual physicians, we employ in avoiding this treatment,  and show our <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> by struggling against what is for our own interest, our skill in shunning what is for our health.</p>

<p>20. For we either hide away our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, cloaking it over in the depth of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, like some festering and malignant disease, as if by escaping the notice of men we could escape the mighty eye of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Or else we allege excuses in our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,  by devising pleas in defence of our falls, or tightly closing our ears, like the deaf adder that stops her ears, we are obstinate in refusing to hear the voice of the charmer, and be treated with the medicines of wisdom,  by which spiritual sickness is healed. Or, lastly, those of us who are most daring and self-willed shamelessly brazen out our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> before those who would heal it, marching with bared head, as the saying is, into all kinds of transgression. O what <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, if there be no term more fitting for this state of mind! Those whom we ought to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> as our benefactors we keep off, as if they were our enemies, hating those who reprove in the gates, and abhorring the righteous word; <span class="stiki" id="note312587"><a href="../bible/amo005.htm#verse10">Amos&nbsp;5:10</a></span> and we think that we shall succeed in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that we are waging against those who are well disposed to us by doing ourselves all the harm we can, like men who <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> they are consuming the flesh of others when they are really fastening upon their own.</p>

<p>21. For these reasons I allege that our office as physicians far exceeds in toilsomeness, and consequently in worth, that which is confined to the body; and further, because the latter is mainly concerned with the surface, and only in a slight degree investigates the causes which are deeply hidden. But the whole of our treatment and exertion is concerned with the hidden man of the heart, <span class="stiki" id="note312588"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:4</a></span> and our warfare is directed against that adversary and foe within us, who uses ourselves as his weapons against ourselves, and, most fearful of all, hands us over to the death of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. In opposition then, to these foes we are in need of great and perfect <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and of still greater co-operation on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, as I am persuaded, of no slight countermanoeuvring on our own part, which must manifest itself both in word and deed, if ourselves, the most precious possession we have, are to be duly tended and cleansed and made as deserving as possible.</p>

<p>22. To turn however to the ends in view in each of these forms of healing, for this point is still left to be considered, the one preserves, if it already exists, the health and good habit of the flesh, or if absent, recalls it; though it is not yet clear whether or not these will be for the advantage of those who possess them, since their opposites very often confer a greater benefit on those who have them, just as poverty and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, renown or disgrace, a low or brilliant position, and all other circumstances, which are naturally indifferent, and do not incline in one direction more than in another, produce a good or bad effect according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of, and the manner in which they are used by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who experience them. But the scope of our art is to provide the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with wings, to rescue it from the world and give it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to watch over that which is in His image, <span class="stiki" id="note312589"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> if it abides, to take it by the hand, if it is in danger, or restore it, if ruined, to make Christ to dwell in the heart <span class="stiki" id="note312590"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse17">Ephesians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> by the Spirit: and, in short, to deify, and bestow heavenly bliss upon, one who belongs to the heavenly host.</p>

<p>23. This is the wish of our schoolmaster <span class="stiki" id="note312591"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse24">Galatians&nbsp;3:24</a></span> the law, of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who intervened between Christ and the law, of Christ who is the fulfiller and end <span class="stiki" id="note312592"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse2">Hebrews&nbsp;12:2</a></span> of the spiritual law; of the emptied Godhead, <span class="stiki" id="note312593"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> of the assumed flesh, <span class="stiki" id="note312594"><a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;2:14</a></span> of the novel union between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, one consisting  of two, and both in one. This is why God was united  to the flesh by means of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,  and natures so separate were knit together by the affinity to each of the element which mediated between them: so all became one for the sake of all, and for the sake of one, our progenitor, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> because of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which was disobedient, the flesh because of the flesh which co-operated with it and shared in its condemnation, Christ, Who was superior to, and beyond the reach of, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because of Adam, who became subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>24. This is why the new was substituted for the old, <span class="stiki" id="note312598"><a href="../bible/heb008.htm#verse8">Hebrews&nbsp;8:8-13</a></span> why He Who suffered was for suffering recalled to life, why each property of His, Who was above us, was interchanged with each of ours, why the new <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> took place of the dispensation, due to loving kindness which deals with him who fell through disobedience. This is the reason for the generation and the virgin, for the manger and <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>; the generation on behalf of the creation,  the virgin on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note312600"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;2:7</a></span> <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> <span class="stiki" id="note312601"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;2:7</a></span> because of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a>, the manger because of the garden, small and visible things on behalf of great and hidden things. This is why the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <span class="stiki" id="note312602"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;2:14</a></span> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> first the heavenly, then the earthly, <span class="stiki" id="note312603"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse49">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:49</a></span> why the shepherds saw the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> over the Lamb and the Shepherd, why the star led the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> to worship and offer gifts, <span class="stiki" id="note312604"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;2:9,&nbsp;11</a></span> in order that <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> might be destroyed. This is why Jesus was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>,  and received testimony from above, and fasted, <span class="stiki" id="note312606"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;4:2</a></span> and was tempted, and overcame him who had overcome. This is why devils were cast out, <span class="stiki" id="note312607"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;10:7-8</a></span> and diseases healed, and the mighty preaching was entrusted to, and successfully proclaimed by men of low estate.</p>

<p>25. This is why the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> rage and the peoples <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> vain things;  why tree  is set over against tree, <span class="stiki" id="note312610"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;19:17</a></span> hands against hand, the one stretched out in self indulgence, <span class="stiki" id="note312611"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;3:6-23</a></span> the others in generosity; the one unrestrained, the others fixed by nails, <span class="stiki" id="note312612"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse35">Matthew&nbsp;27:35</a></span> the one expelling Adam, the other reconciling the ends of the earth. This is the reason of the lifting up to atone for the fall, and of the gall for the tasting, and of the thorny crown for the dominion of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and of death for death, and of darkness for the sake of light, and of burial for the return to the ground, and of resurrection for the sake of resurrection.  All these are a training from God for us, and a healing for our weakness, restoring the old <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to the place whence he fell, and conducting us to the tree of life,  from which the tree of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> estranged us, when partaken of unseasonably, and improperly.</p>

<p>26. Of this healing we, who are set over others, are the ministers and fellow-labourers;  for whom it is a great thing to recognise and heal their own <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and sicknesses: or rather, not really a great thing, only the viciousness of most of those who belong to this order has made me say so: but a much greater thing is the power to heal and skilfully cleanse those of others, to the advantage both of those who are in want of healing and of those whose charge it is to heal.</p>

<p>27. Again, the healers of our bodies will have their labours and <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a> and cares, of which we are aware; and will reap a harvest of pain for themselves from the distresses of others, as one of their wise men  said; and will provide for the use of those who need them, both the results of their own labours and investigations, and what they have been able to borrow from others: and they consider none, even of the minutest details, which they discover, or which elude their search, as having other than an important influence upon health or danger. And what is the object of all this? That a man may live some days longer on the earth, though he is possibly not a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, but one of the most depraved, for whom it had perhaps been better, because of his badness, to have died long ago, in order to be set free from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, the most serious of sicknesses. But, suppose he is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, how long will he be able to live? Forever? Or what will he gain from life here, from which it is the greatest of blessings, if a man be sane and sensible, to seek to be set free?</p>

<p>28. But we, upon whose efforts is staked the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, a being blessed and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and destined for undying chastisement or praise, for its <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>&mdash;what a struggle ought ours to be, and how great skill do we require to treat, or get men treated properly, and to change their life, and give up the clay to the spirit. For men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, young and old, rich and poor, the sanguine and despondent, the sick and whole, rulers and ruled, the wise and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, the cowardly and courageous, the wrathful and meek, the successful and failing, do not require the same instruction and encouragement.</p>

<p>29. And if you examine more closely, how great is the distinction between the married and the unmarried, and among the latter between hermits and those who  live together in community, between those who are proficient and advanced in <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and those who barely hold on the straight course, between townsfolk again and rustics, between the simple and the designing, between men of business and men of leisure, between those who have met with reverses and those who are prosperous and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of misfortune. For these classes differ sometimes more widely from each other in their desires and passion than in their physical characteristics; or, if you will, in the mixtures and blendings of the elements of which we are composed, and, therefore, to regulate them is no easy task.</p>

<p>30. As then the same medicine and the same food are not in every case administered to men's bodies, but a difference is made according to their degree of health or infirmity; so also are <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> treated with varying instruction and guidance. To this treatment <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is borne by those who have had experience of it. Some are led by doctrine, others trained by example; some need the spur, others the curb; some are sluggish and hard to rouse to the good, and must be stirred up by being smitten with the word; others are immoderately fervent in spirit, with impulses difficult to restrain, like thoroughbred colts, who run wide of the turning post, and to improve them the word must have a restraining and checking influence.</p>

<p>31. Some are benefited by praise, others by blame, both being applied in season; while if out of season, or unreasonable, they are injurious; some are set right by encouragement, others by rebuke; some, when taken to task in public, others, when privately corrected. For some are wont to despise private admonitions, but are recalled to their senses by the condemnation of a number of people, while others, who would grow reckless under reproof openly given, accept rebuke because it is in secret, and yield <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> in return for sympathy.</p>

<p>32. Upon some it is needful to keep a close watch, even in the minutest details, because if they think they are unperceived (as they would contrive to be), they are puffed up with the idea of their own wisdom. Of others it is better to take no notice, but seeing not to see, and hearing not to hear them, according to the proverb, that we may not drive them to despair, under the depressing influence of repeated reproofs, and at last to utter recklessness, when they have lost the sense of self-respect, the source of persuasiveness.  In some cases we must even be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, without feeling <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, or treat them with a disdain we do not feel, or manifest despair, though we do not really despair of them, according to the needs of their nature. Others again we must treat with condescension  and lowliness, aiding them readily to conceive a hope of better things. Some it is often more advantageous to conquer&mdash; by others to be overcome, and to praise or deprecate, in one case <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and power, in another poverty and failure.</p>

<p>33. For our treatment does not correspond with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, one of which is most excellent and beneficial at all times and in all cases, and the other most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and harmful; and, instead of one and the same of our medicines invariably proving either most wholesome or most dangerous in the same cases&mdash; be it severity or gentleness, or any of the others which we have enumerated&mdash; in some cases it proves good and useful, in others again it has the contrary effect, according, I suppose, as time and circumstance and the disposition of the patient admit. Now to set before you the distinction between all these things, and give you a perfectly exact view of them, so that you may in brief comprehend the medical art, is quite impossible, even for one in the highest degree qualified by care and skill: but actual experience and practice are requisite to form  a medical system and a medical man.</p>

<p>34. This, however, I take to be generally admitted&mdash; that just as it is not safe for those who walk on a lofty tight rope to lean to either side, for even though the inclination seems slight, it has no slight consequences, but their safety depends upon their perfect balance: so in the case of one of us, if he leans to either side, whether from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, no slight danger of a fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is incurred, both for himself and those who are led by him. But we must really walk in the King's highway, <span class="stiki" id="note312621"><a href="../bible/num020.htm#verse17">Numbers&nbsp;20:17</a></span> and take care not to turn aside from it either to the right hand or to the left, <span class="stiki" id="note312622"><a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse27">Proverbs&nbsp;4:27</a></span> as the Proverbs say. For such is the case with our <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and such in this matter is the task of the good shepherd, if he is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> properly the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of his flock, and to guide them according to the methods of a pastoral care which is right and just, and worthy of our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Shepherd.</p>

<p>35. In regard to the distribution of the word, to mention last the first of our duties, of that divine and exalted word, which everyone now is ready to discourse upon; if anyone else boldly undertakes it and supposes it within the power of every man's <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, I am amazed at his intelligence, not to say his folly. To me indeed it seems no slight task, and one requiring no little spiritual power, to give in due season <span class="stiki" id="note312623"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;12:42</a></span> to each his portion of the word, and to regulate with judgment the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of our opinions, which are concerned with such subjects as the world or worlds,  matter, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, intelligent natures, better or worse, <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> which holds together and guides the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and seems in our experience of it to be governed according to some principle, but one which is at variance with those of earth and of men.</p>

<p>36. Again, they are concerned with our original constitution, and final restoration, the types of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the covenants, the first and second coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, sufferings and dissolution,  with the resurrection, the last day, the judgment and recompense, whether sad or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>; I, to crown all, with what we are to think of the original  and blessed Trinity. Now this involves a very great risk to those who are charged with the illumination  of others, if they are to avoid contracting  their doctrine to a single Person, from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, and so leave us empty terms, if we suppose the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to be one and the same Person only: or, on the other hand, severing It into three, either foreign and diverse, or disordered and unprincipled, and, so to say, opposed divinities, thus falling from the opposite side into an equally dangerous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>: like some distorted plant if bent far back in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>37. For, amid the three infirmities in regard to theology, <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, one of which is patronised by Sabellius the Libyan, another by <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> of Alexandria, and the third by some of the ultra-<a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> among us, what is my position, can I avoid whatever in these three is noxious, and remain within the limits of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; neither being led astray by the new analysis and synthesis into the <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a>  of Sabellius, to assert not so much that all are one as that each is nothing, for things which are transferred and pass into each other cease to be that which each one of them is, of that we have an unnaturally compound deity, like those mythical creatures, the subject of a picturesque imagination: nor again, by alleging a plurality of severed natures, according to the well named <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>  of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, becoming involved in a Jewish poverty, and introducing <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> into the divine nature, by limiting the Godhead to the Unbegotten One alone, as if afraid that our God would perish, if He were the Father of a real God of equal nature: nor again, by arraying three principles in opposition to, or in alliance with, each other, introducing the Gentile plurality of principles from which we have escaped?</p>

<p>38. It is necessary neither to be so devoted to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">rob</a> Him of His Fatherhood, for whose Father would He be, if the Son were separated and estranged from Him, by being ranked with the creation, (for an alien being, or one which is combined and confounded with his father, and, for the sense is the same, throws him into confusion, is not a son); nor to be so devoted to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as to neglect to preserve both His Sonship, (for whose son would He be, if His origin were not referred to the Father?) and the rank of the Father as origin, inasmuch as He is the Father and Generator; for He would be the origin of petty and unworthy beings, or rather the term would be used in a petty and unworthy sense, if He were not the origin of Godhead and goodness, which are contemplated in the Son and the Spirit: the former being the Son and the Word, the latter the proceeding and indissoluble Spirit. For both the Unity of the Godhead must be preserved, and the Trinity of Persons confessed, each with His own property.</p>

<p>39. A suitable and worthy comprehension and exposition of this subject demands a discussion of greater length than the present occasion, or even our life, as I suppose, allows, and, what is more, both now and at all times, the aid of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, by Whom alone we are able to perceive, to expound, or to embrace, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in regard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the pure alone can grasp Him Who is pure and of the same disposition as himself; and I have now briefly dwelt upon the subject, to show how difficult it is to discuss such important questions, especially before a large audience, composed of every age and condition, and needing like an instrument of many strings, to be played upon in various ways; or to find any form of words able to edify them all, and illuminate them with the light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For it is not only that there are three sources from which danger springs, understanding, speech, and hearing, so that failure in one, if not in all, is infallibly certain; for either the mind is not illuminated, or the language is feeble, or the hearing, not having been cleansed, fails to comprehend, and accordingly, in one or all respects, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must be maimed: but further, what makes the instruction of those who profess to teach any other subject so easy and acceptable&mdash; viz. the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>  of the audience&mdash; on this subject involves difficulty and danger.</p>

<p>40. For having undertaken to contend on behalf of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Supreme Being, and of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and of the primary hope  of us all, the more fervent they are in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the more hostile are they to what is said, supposing that a submissive spirit indicates, not <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, but treason to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and therefore they would <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> anything rather than their private convictions, and the accustomed doctrines in which they have been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>. I am now referring to those who are moderate and not utterly depraved in disposition, who, if they have erred in regard to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, have erred from <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, who have <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, though not according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note312633"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;10:2</a></span> who will possibly be of the number of those not excessively condemned, and not beaten with many stripes, <span class="stiki" id="note312634"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;12:47</a></span> because it is not through <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> or depravity that they have failed to do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of their Lord; and these perchance would be persuaded and forsake the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> opinion which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their hostility, if some reason either from their own minds, or from others, were to take hold of them, and at a critical moment, like iron from flint, strike fire from a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> which is pregnant and worthy of the light, for thus a little spark would quickly kindle the torch of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> within it.</p>

<p>41. But what is to be said of those who, from vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> or arrogance, speak unrighteousness against the most High,  arming themselves with the insolence of Jannes and Jambres, <span class="stiki" id="note312636"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:8</a></span> not against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and rising in opposition to sound doctrine? Or of the third class, who through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and, its consequence, temerity, rush headlong against every form of doctrine in swinish fashion, and trample under foot the fair pearls  of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?</p>

<p>42. What again of those who come with no private idea, or form of words, better or worse, in regard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but listen to all kinds of doctrines and teachers, with the intention of selecting from all what is best and safest, in reliance upon no better judges of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> than themselves? They are, in consequence, borne and turned about here and there by one plausible idea after another, and, after being deluged and trodden down by all kinds of doctrine, <span class="stiki" id="note312638"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse14">Ephesians&nbsp;4:14</a></span> and having rung the changes on a long succession of teachers and formul&aelig;, which they throw to the winds as readily as dust, their ears and minds at last are wearied out, and, O what folly! They become equally disgusted with all forms of doctrine, and assume the wretched character of deriding and despising our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as unstable and unsound; passing in their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> from the teachers to the doctrine: as if anyone whose eyes were diseased, or whose ears had been injured, were to complain of the sun for being dim and not shining, or of sounds for being inharmonious and feeble.</p>

<p>43. Accordingly, to impress the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> upon a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> when it is still fresh, like wax not yet subjected to the seal, is an easier task than inscribing <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> doctrine on the top of inscriptions&mdash; I mean wrong doctrines and <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> &mdash; with the result that the former are confused and thrown into disorder by the latter. It is better indeed to tread a road which is smooth and well trodden than one which is untrodden and rough, or to plough land which has often been cleft and broken up by the plough: but a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be written upon should be free from the inscription of harmful doctrines, or the deeply cut marks of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>: otherwise the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> inscriber would have a twofold task, the erasure of the former impressions and the substitution of others which are more excellent, and more worthy to abide. So numerous are they whose <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is shown, not only by yielding to their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but even by their utterances, and so numerous the forms and characters of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and so considerable the task of one who has been entrusted with this office of educating and taking charge of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Indeed I have omitted the majority of the details, lest my speech should be unnecessarily burdensome.</p>

<p>44. If anyone were to undertake to tame and train an animal of many forms and shapes, compounded of many animals of various sizes and degrees of tameness and wildness, his principal task, involving a considerable struggle, would be the government of so extraordinary and heterogeneous a nature, since each of the animals of which it is compounded would, according to its nature or habit, be differently affected with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, pleasure or dislike, by the same words, or food, or stroking with the hand, or whistling, or other modes of treatment. And what must the master of such an animal do, but show himself manifold and various in his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and apply to each a treatment suitable for it, so as successfully to lead and preserve the beast? And since the common body of the church is composed of many different characters and minds, like a single animal compounded of discordant parts, it is absolutely necessary that its ruler should be at once simple in his uprightness in all respects, and as far as possible manifold and varied in his treatment of individuals, and in dealing with all in an appropriate and suitable manner.</p>

<p>45. For some need to be fed with the milk  of the most simple and elementary doctrines, viz., those who are in habit babes and, so to say, new-made, and unable to bear the manly food of the word: nay, if it were presented to them beyond their strength, they would probably be overwhelmed and oppressed, owing to the inability of their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as is the case with our material bodies,  to digest and appropriate what is offered to it, and so would lose even their original power. Others require the wisdom which is spoken among the perfect, <span class="stiki" id="note312642"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:6</a></span> and the higher and more solid food, since their senses have been sufficiently exercised to discern <span class="stiki" id="note312643"><a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;5:14</a></span> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, and if they were made to drink milk, and fed on the vegetable diet of invalids, <span class="stiki" id="note312644"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;14:2</a></span> they would be annoyed. And with good reason, for they would not be strengthened  according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor make that laudable increase, which the Word produces in one who is rightly fed, by making him a perfect man, and bringing him to the measure of spiritual stature. <span class="stiki" id="note312646"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> </p>

<p>46. And who is sufficient for these things? For we are not as the many, able to corrupt <span class="stiki" id="note312647"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:16-17</a></span> the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and mix the wine, <span class="stiki" id="note312648"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;1:22</a></span> which makes glad the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,  with water, mix, that is, our doctrine with what is common and cheap, and debased, and stale, and tasteless, in order to turn the adulteration to our profit, and accommodate ourselves to those who meet us, and curry favor with everyone, becoming ventriloquists  and chatterers, who serve their own pleasures by words uttered from the earth, and sinking into the earth, and, to gain the special good will of the multitude, injuring in the highest degree, nay, ruining ourselves, and shedding the innocent blood of simpler <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which will be required at our hands. </p>

<p>47. Besides, we are aware that it is better to offer our own reins to others more skilful than ourselves, than, while inexperienced, to guide the course of others, and rather to give a kindly hearing than stir an untrained tongue; and after a discussion of these points with advisers who are, I fancy, of no mean worth, and, at any rate, wish us well, we preferred to learn those canons of speech and action which we did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, rather than undertake to teach them in our <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. For it is delightful to have the reasoning  of the aged come to one even until the depth of old age, able, as it is, to aid a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> new to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Accordingly, to undertake the training of others before being sufficiently trained oneself, and to learn, as men say, the potter's art on a wine-jar, that is, to practise ourselves in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> at the expense of others' <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> seems to me to be excessive folly or excessive rashness&mdash; folly, if we are not even aware of our own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; rashness, if in spite of this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> we venture on the task.</p>

<p>48. Nay, the wiser of the Hebrews tell us that there was of old among the Hebrews a most excellent and praiseworthy law,  that every age was not entrusted with the whole of Scripture, inasmuch as this would not be the more profitable course, since the whole of it is not at once intelligible to everyone, and its more recondite parts would, by their apparent meaning, do a very great injury to most people. Some portions therefore, whose exterior  is unexceptionable, are from the first permitted and common to all; while others are only entrusted to those who have attained their twenty-fifth year, viz., such as hide their mystical beauty under a mean-looking cloak, to be the reward of diligence and an illustrious life; flashing forth and presenting itself only to those whose mind has been purified, on the ground that this age alone  can be superior to the body, and properly rise from the letter to the spirit.</p>

<p>49. Among us, however, there is no boundary line between giving and receiving instruction, like the stones of old between the tribes within and beyond the Jordan: nor is a certain part entrusted to some, another to others; nor any rule for degrees  of experience; but the matter has been so disturbed and thrown into confusion, that most of us, not to say all, almost before we have lost our childish curls and lisp, before we have entered the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even the names of the Sacred Books, before we have learned the character and authors of the Old and New Testaments: (for my present point is not our want of cleansing from the mire and marks of spiritual shame which our viciousness has contracted) if, I say, we have furnished ourselves with two or three expressions of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> authors, and that by hearsay, not by study; if we have had a brief experience of David, or clad ourselves properly in a cloaklet, or are wearing at least a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher's</a> girdle, or have girt about us some form and appearance of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>&mdash; phew! How we take the chair and show our spirit! Samuel was <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> even in his swaddling-clothes: <span class="stiki" id="note312657"><a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;2:11</a></span> we are at once wise teachers, of high estimation in Divine things, the first of <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and lawyers; we ordain ourselves men of heaven and seek to be called Rabbi by men; <span class="stiki" id="note312658"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;23:7</a></span> the letter is nowhere, everything is to be understood spiritually, and our dreams are utter drivel, and we should be annoyed if we were not lauded to excess. This is the case with the better and more simple of us: what of those who are more spiritual and noble?  After frequently condemning us, as men of no account, they have forsaken us, and abhor fellowship with impious people such as we are.</p>

<p>50. Now, if we were to speak gently to one of them, advancing, as follows, step by step in argument: <q>Tell me, my good sir, do you call dancing anything, and flute-playing?</q> <q>Certainly,</q> they would say. <q>What then of wisdom and being wise, which we venture to define as a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>?</q> This also they will admit. <q>Are then these accomplishments better than and superior to wisdom, or wisdom by far better than these?</q> <q>Better even than all things,</q> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well that they will say. Up to this point they are judicious. <q>Well, dancing and flute-playing require to be taught and learned, a process which takes time, and much toil in the sweat of the brow, and sometimes the payment of fees, and entreaties for initiation, and long absence from home, and all else which must be done and borne for the acquisition of experience: but as for wisdom, which is chief of all things, and holds in her embrace everything which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so that even God himself prefers this title to all the names which He is called; are we to suppose that it is a matter of such slight consequence, and so accessible, that we need but wish, and we would be wise?</q> <q>It would be utter folly to do so.</q> If we, or any learned and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> man, were to say this to them, and try by degrees to cleanse them from their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, it would be sowing upon rocks, <span class="stiki" id="note312660"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse6">Luke&nbsp;8:6</a></span> and speaking to ears of men who will not hear: <span class="stiki" id="note312661"><a href="../bible/sir025.htm#verse9">Sirach&nbsp;25:9</a></span> so far are they from being even wise enough to perceive their own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. And we may rightly, in my opinion, apply to them the saying of Solomon: There is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which I have seen under the sun, <span class="stiki" id="note312662"><a href="../bible/ecc010.htm#verse5">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;10:5</a></span> a man wise in his own conceit; <span class="stiki" id="note312663"><a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse12">Proverbs&nbsp;26:12</a></span> and a still greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is to charge with the instruction of others a man who is not even aware of his own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.</p>

<p>51. This is a state of mind which demands, in special degree, our tears and groans, and has often stirred my pity, from the conviction that imagination robs us in great measure of reality, and that vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is a great hindrance to men's attainment of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. To heal and stay this disease needs a Peter or <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, those great <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who in addition to guidance in word and deed, received their <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,  and became all things to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that they might gain all. <span class="stiki" id="note312665"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:22</a></span> But for other men like ourselves, it is a great thing to be rightly guided and led by those who have been charged with the correction and setting right of things such as these.</p>

<p>52. Since, however, I have mentioned <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and men like him, I will, with your permission, pass by all others who have been foremost as lawgivers, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, or leaders, or in any similar office&mdash; for instance, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, Joshua, Elijah, Elisha, the Judges, Samuel, David, the company of Prophets, John, the Twelve Apostles, and their successors, who with many toils and labors exercised their authority, each in his own time; all these I pass by, to set forth <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> as the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to my assertions, and for us to consider by his example how important a matter is the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and whether it requires slight attention and little judgment. But that we may recognize and perceive this, let us hear what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself says of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.</p>

<p>53. I say nothing of his labours, his watchings, his sufferings in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness, his assailants from without, his adversaries within.  I pass over the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, councils, prisons, bonds, accusers, tribunals, the daily and hourly deaths, the basket, the <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stonings</a>, beatings with rods, the travelling about, the perils by land and sea, the deep, the shipwrecks, the perils of rivers, perils of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, perils from his countrymen, perils among false brethren, the living by his own hands, the gospel without charge,  the being a spectacle to both <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men,  set in the midst between God and men to champion His <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>,  and to unite them to Him, and make them His own peculiar people, <span class="stiki" id="note312670"><a href="../bible/tit002.htm#verse14">Titus&nbsp;2:14</a></span> beside those things that are without. <span class="stiki" id="note312671"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse28">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:28-29</a></span> For who could worthily detail these matters, the daily pressure,  the individual solicitude, the care of all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, the universal sympathy, and brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Did anyone stumble, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also was weak; did another suffer scandal, it was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> who was on fire.</p>

<p>54. What of the laboriousness of his teaching? The manifold character of his ministry? His loving kindness? And on the other hand his strictness? And the combination and blending of the two; in such wise that his gentleness should not enervate, nor his severity exasperate? He gives <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for slaves and masters, <span class="stiki" id="note312673"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;6:5,&nbsp;9</a></span> rulers and ruled, <span class="stiki" id="note312674"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;13:1-3</a></span> husbands and wives,  <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and children, <span class="stiki" id="note312676"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse1">Ephesians&nbsp;6:1-4</a></span> marriage and celibacy,  self-discipline and indulgence,  wisdom and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>,  <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and uncircumcision,  Christ and the world, the flesh and the spirit. <span class="stiki" id="note312681"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse16">Galatians&nbsp;5:16</a></span> On behalf of some he gives thanks, others he upbraids. Some he names his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and crown, <span class="stiki" id="note312682"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse1">Philippians&nbsp;4:1</a></span> others he charges with folly. <span class="stiki" id="note312683"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;3:1</a></span> Some who hold a straight course he accompanies, sharing in their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; others he checks, who are going wrong. At one time he excommunicates, <span class="stiki" id="note312684"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:5</a></span> at another he confirms his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note312685"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> at one time he grieves, at another rejoices; at one time he feeds with milk, at another he handles <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>;  at one time he condescends, at another he raises to his own level; at one time he threatens a rod,  at another he offers the spirit of meekness; at one time he is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> toward the lofty, at another lowly toward the lowly. Now he is least of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,  now he offers a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of Christ speaking in him; <span class="stiki" id="note312689"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:3</a></span> now he longs for departure and is being poured forth as a libation,  now he thinks it more necessary for their sakes to abide in the flesh. For he seeks not his own interests, but those of his children, <span class="stiki" id="note312691"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse33">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:33</a></span> whom he has begotten in Christ by the gospel.  This is the aim of all his spiritual authority, in everything to neglect his own in comparison with the advantage of others.</p>

<p>55. He glories in his infirmities and distresses. He takes pleasure in the dying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>,  as if it were a kind of ornament. He is lofty in carnal things,  he rejoices in things spiritual; he is not rude in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note312695"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:6</a></span> and claims to see in a mirror, darkly. <span class="stiki" id="note312696"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:12</a></span> He is bold in spirit, and buffets his body,  throwing it as an antagonist. What is the lesson and instruction he would thus impress upon us? Not to be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of earthly things, or puffed up by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or excite the flesh against the spirit. He fights for all, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for all, is jealous for all, is kindled on behalf of all, whether without law, or under the law; a preacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note312698"><a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:11</a></span> a patron of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. He even was exceedingly bold on behalf of his brethren according to the flesh, <span class="stiki" id="note312699"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;9:3</a></span> if I may myself be bold enough to say so, in his loving <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that they might in his stead be brought to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. What magnanimity! What fervor of spirit! He imitates Christ, who became a curse for us, <span class="stiki" id="note312700"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse13">Galatians&nbsp;3:13</a></span> who took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses; <span class="stiki" id="note312701"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;8:17</a></span> or, to use more measured terms, he is ready, next to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to suffer anything, even as one of the ungodly, for them, if only they be saved.</p>

<p>56. Why should I enter into detail? He lived not to himself, but to Christ and his preaching. He crucified the world to himself, <span class="stiki" id="note312702"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;6:14</a></span> and being crucified to the world and the things which are seen, he thought all things little, <span class="stiki" id="note312703"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;3:8</a></span> and too small to be desired; even though from Jerusalem and round about unto <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a> <span class="stiki" id="note312704"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;15:19</a></span> he had fully preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, even though he had been prematurely caught up to the third heaven, and had a vision of Paradise, and had heard unspeakable words.  Such was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and everyone of like spirit with him. But we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that, in comparison with them, we may be foolish princes of Zoan, <span class="stiki" id="note312706"><a href="../bible/isa019.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;19:11</a></span> or extortioners, who exact the fruits of the ground, or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> bless the people:  and further make themselves <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, and confuse the way of your feet,  or mockers ruling over you, or children in authority,  immature in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, not even having bread and clothing enough to be rulers over any;  or <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> teaching lies,  or rebellious princes,  deserving to share the reproach of their elders for the straitness of the famine,  or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> very far from speaking comfortably  to Jerusalem, according to the reproaches and protests urged by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, who was purged by the Seraphim with a live coal. </p>

<p>57. Is the undertaking then so serious and laborious to a sensitive and sad heart&mdash; a very rottenness to the bones <span class="stiki" id="note312716"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse30">Proverbs&nbsp;14:30</a></span> of a sensible man: while the danger is slight, and a fall not worth consideration? Nay the blessed Hosea inspires me with serious alarm, where he says that to us <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and rulers pertains the judgment, <span class="stiki" id="note312717"><a href="../bible/hos005.htm#verse1">Hosea&nbsp;5:1-2</a></span> because we have been a snare to the watchtower; and as a net spread upon Tabor, which has been firmly fixed by the hunters of men's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and he threatens to cut off the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>,  and devour their judges with fire, and to cease for a while from anointing a king and princes,  because they ruled for themselves, and not by Him. </p>

<p>58. Hence again the divine Micah, unable to brook the building of Zion with blood, however you interpret the phrase, and of Jerusalem with iniquity, while the heads thereof judge for reward, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> teach for hire, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> divine for money&mdash; what does he say will be the result of this? Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem be as a lodge in a garden, and the mountain of the house be reckoned as a glade in a thicket. <span class="stiki" id="note312721"><a href="../bible/mic003.htm#verse10">Micah&nbsp;3:10-12</a></span> He bewails also the scarcity of the upright, there being scarcely a stalk or a gleaning grape left, since both the prince asks, and the judge curries favour,  so that his language is almost the same as the mighty David's: Save me, O Lord, for the godly man ceases:  and says that therefore their blessings shall fail them, as if wasted by the moth.</p>

<p>59. Joel again summons us to wailing, and will have the ministers of the altar lament under the presence of famine: so far is he from allowing us to revel in the misfortunes of others: and, after sanctifying a fast, calling a solemn assembly, and gathering the old men, the children, and those of tender age,  we ourselves must further haunt the temple in sackcloth and ashes, <span class="stiki" id="note312725"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;58:5</a></span> prostrated right humbly on the ground, because the field is wasted, and the meat-offering and the drink-offering is cut off from the house of the Lord, till we draw down mercy by our humiliation.</p>

<p>60. What of Habakkuk? He utters more heated words, and is impatient with God Himself, and cries down, as it were our good Lord, because of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of the judges. O Lord, how long shall I cry and You will not hear? Shall I cry out unto You of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and You will not save? Why dost Thou show me toil and labour, causing me to look upon perverseness and impiety? Judgment has been given against me, and the judge is a spoiler. Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment does never go forth. Then comes the denunciation, and what follows upon it. Behold, you despisers, and regard, and wonder marvellously, and vanish away, for I work a work.  But why need I quote the whole of the denunciation? A little further on, however, for I think it best to add this to what has been said, after upbraiding and lamenting many of those who are in some respect <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> or depraved, he upbraids the leaders and teachers of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, stigmatising <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> as a foul disorder, and an intoxication and aberration of mind; charging them with giving their neighbours drink in order to look upon the darkness of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,  and the dens of creeping things and wild beasts, viz.: the dwelling places of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thoughts. Such indeed they are, and such teachings do they discuss with us.</p>

<p>61. How can it be right to pass by Malachi, who at one time brings bitter charges against the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and reproaches them with despising the name of the Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note312728"><a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse6">Malachi&nbsp;1:6</a></span> and explains wherein they did this, by offering polluted bread upon the altar, and meat which is not firstfruits, which they would not have offered to one of their governors, or, if they had offered it, they would have been dishonoured; yet offering these in fulfilment of a vow to the King of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, to wit, the lame and the sick, and the deformed, which are utterly profane and loathsome.  Again he reminds them of the covenant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a covenant of life and peace, with the sons of Levi, and that they should serve Him in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and stand in awe of the manifestation of His Name. The law of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he says, was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips; he walked with me uprightly in peace, and turned away many from iniquity: for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> lips shall keep <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and they shall seek the law at his mouth. And how <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and at the same time how fearful is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>! For he is the messenger of the Lord Almighty.  Although I pass over the following imprecations, as strongly worded,  yet I am afraid of their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. This however may be cited without offense, to our profit. Is it right, he says, to regard your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and receive it with good will at your hands,  as if he were most highly incensed, and rejecting their ministrations owing to their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</p>

<p>62. Whenever I remember Zechariah, I shudder at the reaping-hook,  and likewise at his testimony against the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, his hints in reference to the celebrated Joshua, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, whom he represents as stripped of filthy and unbecoming garments and then clothed in rich <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> apparel.  As for the words and charges to Joshua which he puts into the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> mouth, let them be treated with silent respect, as referring perhaps to a greater  and higher object than those who are many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note312736"><a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse23">Hebrews&nbsp;7:23</a></span> but even at his right hand stood the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, to resist him. A fact, in my eyes, of no slight significance, and demanding no slight <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and watchfulness.</p>

<p>63. Who is so bold and adamantine of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as not to tremble and be abashed at the charges and reproaches deliberately urged against the rest of the shepherds. A voice, he says, of the howling of the shepherds, for their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is spoiled. A voice of the roaring of lions, <span class="stiki" id="note312737"><a href="../bible/zec011.htm#verse3">Zechariah&nbsp;11:3</a></span> for this has befallen them. Does he not all but hear the wailing as if close at hand, and himself wail with the afflicted. A little further is a more striking and impassioned strain. Feed, he says, the flock of slaughter, whose possessors slay them without repentance, and they that sell them say, <q>Blessed be the Lord, for we are rich:</q> and their own shepherds are without feeling for them. Therefore, I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, says the Lord Almighty. <span class="stiki" id="note312738"><a href="../bible/zec011.htm#verse5">Zechariah&nbsp;11:5-6</a></span> And again: Awake, O sword, against the shepherds, and smite the shepherds, and scatter the sheep, and I will turn My Hand upon the shepherds;  and, Mine <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is kindled against the shepherds, and I will visit the lambs:  adding to the threat those who rule over the people. So industriously does he apply himself to his task that he cannot easily free himself from denunciations, and I am afraid that, did I refer to the whole series, I should exhaust your patience. This must then suffice for Zechariah.</p>

<p>64. Passing by the elders in the book of Daniel;  for it is better to pass them by, together with the Lord's righteous sentence and declaration concerning them, that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> came from <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> from ancient judges, who seemed to govern the people; how are we affected by Ezekiel, the beholder and expositor of the mighty <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> and visions? By his injunction to the watchmen <span class="stiki" id="note312742"><a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse2">Ezekiel&nbsp;33:2</a></span> not to keep silence concerning <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and the sword impending over it, a course which would profit neither themselves nor the sinners; but rather to keep watch and forewarn, and thus benefit, at any rate those who gave warning, if not both those who spoke and those who heard?</p>

<p>65. What of his further invective against the shepherds, Woe shall come upon woe, and rumour upon rumour, then shall they seek a vision of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, but the law shall perish from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and counsel from the ancients,  and again, in these terms, <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, say unto her, you are a land that is not watered, nor has rain come upon you in the day of indignation: whose princes in the midst of her are like roaring lions, ravening the prey, devouring <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in their might.  And a little further on: Her <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have violated My <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and profaned My <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, they have put no difference between the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and profane, but all things were alike to them, and they hid their eyes from My <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, and I was profaned among them.  He threatens that He will consume both the wall and them that daubed it,  that is, those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and those who throw a cloak over them; as the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> rulers and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have done, who caused the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> according to their own hearts which are estranged in their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note312747"><a href="../bible/eze014.htm#verse5">Ezekiel&nbsp;14:5</a></span> </p>

<p>66. I also refrain from entering into his discussion of those who feed themselves, devour the milk, clothe themselves with the wool, kill them that are fat, but feed not the flock, strengthen not the diseased, nor bind up that which is broken, nor bring again that which is driven away, nor seek that which is lost, nor keep watch over that which is strong, but oppress them with rigour, and destroy them with their pressure;  so that, because there was no shepherd, the sheep were scattered over every plain and mountain, and became meat for all the fowls and beasts,  because there was no one to seek for them and bring them back. What is the consequence? As I live, says the Lord, because these things are so, and My flock became a prey,  behold I am against the shepherds, and I will require My flock at their hands, and will gather them and make them My own: but the shepherds shall suffer such and such things, as bad shepherds ought.</p>

<p>67. However, to avoid unreasonably prolonging my discourse, by an enumeration of all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and of the words of them all, I will mention but one more, who was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> before he was formed, and sanctified from the womb, <span class="stiki" id="note312751"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:5</a></span> Jeremiah: and will pass over the rest. He longs for water over his head, and a fountain of tears for his eyes, that he may adequately weep for <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>;  and no less does he bewail the depravity of its rulers.</p>

<p>68. God speaks to him in reproof of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> said not, Where is the Lord, and they that handled the law <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Me not; the pastors also transgressed against Me.  Again He says to him: The pastors have become brutish, and have not sought the Lord, and therefore all their flock did not understand, and was scattered.  Again, Many pastors have destroyed My vineyard, and have polluted My pleasant portion, till it was reduced to a trackless wilderness.  He further inveighs against the pastors again: Woe be to the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasture! Therefore thus says the Lord against them that feed My people: You have scattered My flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold I will visit upon you the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of your doings.  Moreover he bids the shepherds to howl, and the rams of the flock to lament, because the days of their slaughter are accomplished. </p>

<p>69. Why need I speak of the things of ancient days? Who can test himself by the rules and standards which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> laid down for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, that they are to be temperate, soberminded, not given to wine, no strikers, apt to teach, blameless in all things, and beyond the reach of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>,  without finding considerable deflection from the straight line of the rules? What of the regulations of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> for his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, when He sends them to preach?  The main object of these is&mdash; not to enter into particulars&mdash; that they should be of such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so simple and modest, and in a word, so heavenly, that the gospel should make its way, no less by their character than by their preaching.</p>

<p>70. I am alarmed by the reproaches of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, the conviction of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a>. For it is disgraceful for us, who ought greatly surpass them, as we are bidden, if we desire the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, to be found more deeply sunk in <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>: so that we deserve to be called serpents, a generation of vipers, and blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel, or sepulchres foul within, in spite of our external comeliness, or platters outwardly clean, and everything else, which they are, or which is laid to their charge. </p>

<p>71. With these thoughts I am occupied night and day: they waste my marrow, and feed upon my flesh, and will not allow me to be confident or to look up. They depress my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and abase my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and fetter my tongue, and make me consider, not the position of a prelate, or the guidance and direction of others, which is far beyond my powers; but how I myself am to escape the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> to come, and to scrape off from myself somewhat of the rust of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. A man must himself be cleansed, before cleansing others: himself become wise, that he may make others wise; become light, and then give light: draw near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so bring others near; be hallowed, then hallow them; be possessed of hands to lead others by the hand, of wisdom to give advice.</p>

<p>72. When will this be, say they who are swift but not sure in every thing, readily building up, readily throwing down. When will the lamp be upon its stand,  and where is the talent?  For so they call the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.  Those who speak thus are more fervent in friendship than in reverence. You ask me, you men of exceeding <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, when these things shall be, and what account I give of them? Not even extreme old age would be too long a limit to assign. For hoary hairs combined with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> are better than inexperienced youth, well-reasoned hesitation than inconsiderate haste, and a brief reign than a long tyranny: just as a small portion honourably won is better than considerable possessions which are dishonourable and uncertain, a little gold than a great weight of lead, a little light than much darkness.</p>

<p>73. But this speed, in its untrustworthiness and excessive haste, is in danger of being like the seeds which fell upon the rock, <span class="stiki" id="note312764"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse6">Luke&nbsp;8:6</a></span> and, because they had no depth of earth, <span class="stiki" id="note312765"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;13:5</a></span> sprang up at once, but could not bear even the first heat of the sun; or like the foundation laid upon the sand,  which could not even make a slight resistance to the rain and the winds. Woe to you, O city, whose king is a child, <span class="stiki" id="note312767"><a href="../bible/ecc010.htm#verse16">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;10:16</a></span> says Solomon. Be not hasty of speech, <span class="stiki" id="note312768"><a href="../bible/pro029.htm#verse20">Proverbs&nbsp;29:20</a></span> says Solomon again, asserting that hastiness of speech is less serious than heated action. And who, in spite of all this, demands haste rather than security and utility? Who can mould, as clay-figures are modelled in a single day, the defender of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, who is to take his stand with Angels, and give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with Archangels, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to ascend to the altar on high, and share the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and renew the creature, and set forth the image, and create inhabitants for the world above, aye and, greatest of all, be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and make others to be God?</p>

<p>74. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Whose ministers we are, and where we are placed, and whither we are guides. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the height of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the weakness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and, on the contrary, his power. <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> is high, and the earth deep;  and who of those who have been cast down by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall ascend?  Who that is as yet surrounded by the gloom here below, and by the grossness of the flesh can purely gaze with his whole mind upon that whole <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and amid unstable and visible things hold intercourse with the stable and invisible? For hardly may one of those who have been most specially purged, behold here even an image of the Good, as men see the sun in the water. Who has measured the water with his hand, and the heaven with a span, and the whole earth in a measure? Who has weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? <span class="stiki" id="note312771"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;40:12</a></span> What is the place of his rest?  and to whom shall he be likened? </p>

<p>75. Who is it, Who made all things by His Word,  and formed man by His Wisdom, and gathered into one things scattered abroad, and mingled dust with spirit, and compounded an animal visible and invisible, temporal and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, earthly and heavenly, able to attain to God but not to comprehend Him, drawing near and yet afar off. I said, I will be wise, says Solomon, but she (i.e. Wisdom) was far from me beyond what is: <span class="stiki" id="note312775"><a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse24">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;7:24</a></span> and, Verily, he that increases <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> increases sorrow.  For the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of what we have discovered is no greater than the pain of what escapes us; a pain, I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, like that felt by those who are dragged, while yet thirsty, from the water, or are unable to retain what they think they hold, or are suddenly left in the dark by a flash of lightning.</p>

<p>76. This depressed and kept me <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and persuaded me that it was better to hear the voice of praise  than to be an expounder of truths beyond my power; the majesty, and the height, and the dignity, and the pure natures scarce able to contain the brightness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whom the deep covers, Whose secret place is darkness,  since He is the purest light, <span class="stiki" id="note312779"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:16</a></span> which most men cannot approach unto; Who is in all this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and again is beyond the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; Who is all goodness, <span class="stiki" id="note312780"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse19">Exodus&nbsp;33:19</a></span> and beyond all goodness; Who enlightens the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and escapes the quickness and height of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, ever retiring as much as He is apprehended, and by His flight and stealing away when grasped, withdrawing to the things above one who is enamoured of Him.</p>

<p>77. Such and so great is the object of our longing <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and such a man should he be, who prepares and conducts <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to their espousals. For myself, I feared to be cast, bound hand and foot, <span class="stiki" id="note312781"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;22:13</a></span> from the bride-chamber, for not having on a wedding-garment, and for having rashly intruded among those who there sit at meat. And yet I had been invited from my youth, if I may speak of what most men <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, and had been cast upon Him from the womb,  and presented by the promise of my mother, afterwards confirmed in the hour of danger: and my longing grew up with it, and my reason agreed to it, and I gave as an offering my all to Him Who had won me and saved me, my property, my fame, my health, my very words, from which I only gained the advantage of being able to despise them, and of having something in comparison of which I preferred Christ. And the words of God were made sweet as honeycombs  to me, and I cried after <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and lifted up my voice for wisdom. <span class="stiki" id="note312784"><a href="../bible/pro002.htm#verse3">Proverbs&nbsp;2:3</a></span> There was moreover the moderation of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, the curbing of the tongue, the restraint  of the eyes, the discipline of the belly, and the trampling under foot of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which clings to the earth. I speak foolishly, <span class="stiki" id="note312785"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse23">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:23</a></span> but it shall be said, in these pursuits I was perhaps not inferior to many.</p>

<p>78. One branch of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is, however, too high for me, the commission to guide and govern <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>&mdash; and before I have rightly learned to submit to a shepherd, or have had my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> duly cleansed, the charge of caring for a flock: especially in times like these, when a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, seeing everyone else rushing here and there in confusion, is content to flee from the melee and escape, in sheltered retirement, from the storm and gloom of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one: when the members are at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with one another, and the slight remains of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which once <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, have departed, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is a mere empty name, since, as it is said, contempt  has been poured upon princes. </p>

<p>79. Would that it were merely empty! And now may their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> fall upon the head of the ungodly! All <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> has been banished from <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, shamelessness has taken its place, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>  and the deep things of the Spirit <span class="stiki" id="note312789"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:10</a></span> are at the disposal of anyone who will; and we all become <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> by simply condemning the impiety of others; and we claim the services of ungodly judges,  and fling that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to the dogs, and cast pearls before swine, <span class="stiki" id="note312791"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span> by publishing divine things in the hearing of profane <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and, wretches that we are, carefully fulfil the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of our enemies, and are not ashamed to go a whoring with our own inventions.  Moabites and Ammonites, who were not permitted even to enter the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note312793"><a href="../bible/deu023.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy&nbsp;23:3</a></span> frequent our most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. We have opened to all not the gates of righteousness,  but, doors of railing and partizan arrogance; and the first place among us is given, not to one who in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God refrains from even an idle word, but to him who can revile his neighbour most fluently, whether explicitly, or by covert allusion; who rolls beneath his tongue mischief and iniquity, or to speak more accurately, the poison of asps. </p>

<p>80. We observe each other's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, not to bewail them, but to make them subjects of reproach, not to heal them, but to aggravate them, and excuse our own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> by the wounds of our neighbours. Bad and good men are distinguished not according to personal character, but by their disagreement or friendship with ourselves. We praise one day what we revile the next, denunciation at the hands of others is a passport to our admiration; so magnanimous are we in our viciousness, that everything is frankly forgiven to impiety.</p>

<p>81. Everything has reverted to the original state of things <span class="stiki" id="note312796"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;1:2</a></span> before the world, with its present fair order and form, came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">being</a>. The general confusion and irregularity cry for some organising hand and power. Or, if you will, it is like a battle at night by the faint light of the moon, when none can discern the faces of friends or foes; or like a sea fight on the surge, with the driving winds, and boiling foam, and dashing waves, and crashing vessels, with the thrusts of poles, the pipes of boatswains, the groans of the fallen, while we make our voices heard above the din, and not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what to do, and having, alas! no opportunity for showing our valour, assail one another, and fall by one another's hands.</p>

<p>82. Nor indeed is there any distinction between the state of the people and that of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>: but it seems to me to be a simple fulfilment of the ancient curse, <q>As with the people so with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.</q>  Nor again are the great and eminent men affected otherwise than the majority; nay, they are openly at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is an aid to their powers of persuasion. And indeed, provided that it be on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and of the highest and most important questions, let them be thus disposed, and I blame them not; nay, to say the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I go so far as to praise and congratulate them. Yea! Would that I were one of those who contend and incur <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth's</a> sake: or rather, I can boast of being one of them. For better is a laudable <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> than a peace which severs a man from God: and therefore it is that the Spirit arms the gentle warrior, as one who is able to wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in a good <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.</p>

<p>83. But at the present time there are some who go to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> even about small matters and to no purpose, and, with great <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and audacity, accept, as an associate in their ill-doing, anyone whoever he may be. Then everyone makes the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> his pretext, and this venerable name is dragged into their private quarrels. Consequently, as was probable, we are <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, even among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and, what is harder still, we cannot say that this is without just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Nay, even the best of our own people are scandalized, while this result is not surprising in the case of the multitude, who are ill-disposed to accept anything that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</p>

<p>84. Sinners are planning upon our backs;  and what we devise against each other, they turn against us all: and we have become a new spectacle, not to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men, <span class="stiki" id="note312799"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:9</a></span> as says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, that bravest of athletes, in his contest with principalities and powers, <span class="stiki" id="note312800"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians&nbsp;6:12</a></span> but to almost all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, and at every time and place, in the public squares, at carousals, at festivities, and times of sorrow. Nay, we have already&mdash; I can scarcely speak of it without tears&mdash; been represented on the stage, amid the laughter of the most licentious, and the most popular of all dialogues and scenes is the caricature of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</p>

<p>85. These are the results of our intestine warfare, and our extreme readiness to strive about goodness and gentleness, and our inexpedient excess of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for God. Wrestling, or any other athletic contest, is only permitted according to fixed <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and the man will be shouted down and disgraced, and lose the victory, who breaks the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of wrestling, or acts unfairly in any other contest, contrary to the rules laid down for the contest, however able and skilful he may be; and shall anyone contend for Christ in an unchristlike manner, and yet be pleasing to peace for having fought unlawfully in her name.</p>

<p>86. Yea, even now, when Christ is invoked, the devils tremble, <span class="stiki" id="note312801"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse19">James&nbsp;2:19</a></span> and not even by our ill-doing has the power of this Name been extinguished, while we are not ashamed to insult a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and name so venerable; shouting it, and having it shouted in return, almost in public, and every day; for My Name is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> because of you. </p>

<p>87. Of external warfare I am not afraid, nor of that wild beast, and fullness of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, who has now arisen against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, though he may threaten fire, sword, wild beasts, precipices, chasms; though he may show himself more inhuman than all previous madmen, and discover fresh tortures of greater severity. I have one remedy for them all, one road to victory; I will <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in Christ <span class="stiki" id="note312803"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse3">Philippians&nbsp;3:3</a></span> namely, death for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake.</p>

<p>88. For my own warfare, however, I am at a loss what course to pursue, what alliance, what word of wisdom, what <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to devise, with what panoply to arm myself, against the wiles of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one. <span class="stiki" id="note312804"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse11">Ephesians&nbsp;6:11</a></span> What <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is to conquer him by stretching out his hands upon the mount, <span class="stiki" id="note312805"><a href="../bible/exo017.htm#verse11">Exodus&nbsp;17:11</a></span> in order that the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, thus typified and prefigured, may prevail? What Joshua, as his successor, arrayed alongside the Captain of the Lord's hosts? <span class="stiki" id="note312806"><a href="../bible/jos005.htm#verse14">Joshua&nbsp;5:14</a></span> What David, either by harping, or fighting with his sling,  and girded by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with strength unto the battle,  and with his fingers trained to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>?  What Samuel, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> <span class="stiki" id="note312810"><a href="../bible/1sa007.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;7:5</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> for the people, and anointing as king one who can gain the victory? What Jeremiah, by writing lamentations for <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, is fitly to lament these things?</p>

<p>89. Who will cry aloud, Spare Your People, O Lord, and give not Your heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them? <span class="stiki" id="note312811"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse17">Joel&nbsp;2:17</a></span> What <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, and Job,  and Daniel, who are reckoned together as men of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, that we may have a slight respite from warfare, and recover ourselves, and recognize one another for a while, and no longer, instead of united <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, be Judah  and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, Rehoboam and <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, Jerusalem and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, in turn delivered up because of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and in turn lamented.</p>

<p>90. For I own that I am too weak for this warfare, and therefore turned my back, hiding my face in the rout, and sat solitary, <span class="stiki" id="note312814"><a href="../bible/lam003.htm#verse28">Lamentations&nbsp;3:28</a></span> because I was filled with bitterness  and sought to be silent, understanding that it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> time, <span class="stiki" id="note312816"><a href="../bible/mic002.htm#verse3">Micah&nbsp;2:3</a></span> that the beloved had kicked, <span class="stiki" id="note312817"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:15</a></span> that we had become backsliding children, <span class="stiki" id="note312818"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse14">Jeremiah&nbsp;3:14</a></span> who are the luxuriant vine, <span class="stiki" id="note312819"><a href="../bible/hos010.htm#verse1">Hosea&nbsp;10:1</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> vine, all fruitful, all beautiful,  springing up splendidly with showers from on high.  For the diadem of beauty, <span class="stiki" id="note312822"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;62:3</a></span> the signet of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note312823"><a href="../bible/eze028.htm#verse12">Ezekiel&nbsp;28:12</a></span> the crown of magnificence  has been changed for me into shame; and if anyone, in face of these things, is daring and courageous, he has my blessing on his daring and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>.</p>

<p>91. I have said nothing yet of the internal warfare within ourselves, and in our <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, in which we are engaged night and day against the body of our humiliation, <span class="stiki" id="note312825"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians&nbsp;3:21</a></span> either secretly or openly, and against the tide which tosses and whirls us hither and there, by the aid of our senses and other sources of the pleasures of this life; and against the miry clay  in which we have been fixed; and against the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note312827"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;7:23</a></span> which <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the law of the spirit, and strives to destroy the royal image in us, and all the divine emanation which has been bestowed upon us; so that it is difficult for anyone, either by a long course of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> training, and gradual separation of the noble and enlightened part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from that which is debased and yoked with darkness, or by the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or by both together, and by a constant practice of looking upward, to overcome the depressing power of matter. And before a man has, as far as possible, gained this superiority, and sufficiently purified his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and far surpassed his fellows in nearness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I do not think it safe for him to be entrusted with the rule over <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, or the office of mediator (for such, I take it, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is) between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</p>

<p>92. What is it that has induced this <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in me, that, instead of supposing me to be needlessly afraid, you may highly commend my foresight? I hear from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself, when God spoke to him, that, although many were bidden to come to the mount, one of whom was even <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, with his two sons who were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and seventy elders of the senate, the rest were ordered to worship afar off, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> alone to draw near, and the people were not to go up with him. <span class="stiki" id="note312828"><a href="../bible/exo024.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;24:1-2</a></span> For it is not everyone who may draw near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only one who, like <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, can bear the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Moreover, before this, when the law was first given, the trumpet-blasts, and lightnings, and thunders, and darkness, and the smoke of the whole mountain,  and the terrible threats that if even a beast touched the mountain it should be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note312830"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse18">Hebrews&nbsp;12:18</a></span> and other like alarms, kept back the rest of the people, for whom it was a great privilege, after careful purification, merely to hear the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> actually went up and entered into the cloud,  and was charged with the law, and received the tables, which belong, for the multitude, to the letter, but, for those who are above the multitude, to the spirit. <span class="stiki" id="note312832"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:6-7</a></span> </p>

<p>93. I hear again that Nadab and Abihu, for having merely offered <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> with strange fire, were with strange fire destroyed, <span class="stiki" id="note312833"><a href="../bible/lev010.htm#verse1">Leviticus&nbsp;10:1</a></span> the instrument of their impiety being used for their punishment, and their destruction following at the very time and place of their sacrilege; and not even their father <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, who was next to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the favor of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, could save them. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also of Eli the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and a little later of Uzzah, the former made to pay the penalty for his sons' transgression, in daring to violate the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> by an untimely exaction of the first fruits of the cauldrons, although he did not condone their impiety, but frequently rebuked them;  the other, because he only touched the ark, which was being thrown off the cart by the ox, <span class="stiki" id="note312835"><a href="../bible/2sa006.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;6:6</a></span> and though he saved it, was himself destroyed, in God's jealousy for the reverence due to the ark.</p>

<p>94. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also that not even bodily blemishes in either <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <span class="stiki" id="note312836"><a href="../bible/lev021.htm#verse17">Leviticus&nbsp;21:17</a></span> or victims  passed without notice, but that it was required by the law that perfect <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> must be offered by perfect men&mdash; a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>, I take it, of integrity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. It was not lawful for everyone to touch the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> vesture, or any of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> vessels; nor might the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> themselves be consumed except by the proper <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and at the proper time and place;  nor might the anointing oil nor the compounded <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> <span class="stiki" id="note312839"><a href="../bible/exo030.htm#verse33">Exodus&nbsp;30:33,&nbsp;38</a></span> be imitated; nor might anyone enter the temple who was not in the most minute particular pure in both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; so far was the Holy of holies removed from presumptuous access, that it might be entered by one man only once a year;  so far were the veil, and the mercy-seat, and the ark, and the Cherubim, from the general gaze and touch.</p>

<p>95. Since then I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> these things, and that no one is worthy of the mightiness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, who has not first presented himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a living, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and set forth the reasonable, well-pleasing service, <span class="stiki" id="note312841"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;12:1</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to God the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise and the contrite spirit,  which is the only <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> required of us by the Giver of all; how could I dare to offer to Him the external <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, the antitype of the great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>,  or clothe myself with the garb and name of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, before my hands had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> works; before my eyes had been accustomed to gaze safely upon <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, with wonder only for the Creator, and without injury to the creature; before my ear had been sufficiently opened to the instruction of the Lord, and He had opened mine ear to hear  without heaviness, and had set a golden earring with precious sardius, that is, a wise man's word in an <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> ear;  before my mouth had been opened to draw in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>,  and opened wide to be filled  with the spirit of speaking <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> and doctrines; <span class="stiki" id="note312848"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:2</a></span> and my lips bound,  to use the words of wisdom, by divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and, as I would add, loosed in due season: before my tongue had been filled with exultation, and become an instrument of Divine melody, awaking with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, awaking right early,  and laboring till it cleave to my jaws:  before my feet had been set upon the rock,  made like hart's feet, and my footsteps directed in a godly fashion so that they should not nearly slip,  nor slip at all; before all my members had become instruments of righteousness, <span class="stiki" id="note312854"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;6:13</a></span> and all mortality had been put off, and swallowed up of life, <span class="stiki" id="note312855"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:4</a></span> and had yielded to the Spirit?</p>

<p>96. Who is the man, whose heart has never been made to burn, <span class="stiki" id="note312856"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;24:32</a></span> as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> have been opened to him, with the pure words of God which have been tried in a furnace;  who has not, by a triple  inscription  of them upon the breadth of his heart, attained the mind of Christ; <span class="stiki" id="note312860"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:16</a></span> nor been admitted to the treasures which to most men remain hidden, secret, and dark, to gaze upon the riches therein? <span class="stiki" id="note312861"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;45:3</a></span> and become able to enrich others, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. <span class="stiki" id="note312862"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:13</a></span> </p>

<p>97. Who is the man who has never beheld, as our duty is to behold it, the fair beauty of the Lord, nor has visited His temple,  or rather, become the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note312864"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:16</a></span> and the habitation of Christ in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note312865"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse22">Ephesians&nbsp;2:22</a></span> Who is the man who has never recognized the correlation and distinction between figures and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so that by withdrawing from the former and cleaving to the latter, and by thus escaping from the oldness of the letter and serving the newness of the spirit,  he may clean pass over to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from the law, which finds its spiritual fulfilment in the dissolution of the body. <span class="stiki" id="note312867"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;6:6</a></span> </p>

<p>98. Who is the man who has never, by experience and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, traversed the entire series of the titles  and powers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, both those more lofty ones which originally were His, and those more lowly ones which He later assumed for our sake&mdash; viz.: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the Image, the Word, the Wisdom, the Truth, the Light, the Life, the Power, the Vapour, the Emanation, the Effulgence, the Maker, the King, the Head, the Law, the Way, the Door, the Foundation, the Rock, the Pearl, the Peace, the Righteousness, the Sanctification, the Redemption, the Man, the Servant, the Shepherd, the Lamb, the High Priest, the Victim, the Firstborn before creation, the Firstborn from the dead, the Resurrection: who is the man who hearkens, but pays no heed, to these names so pregnant with reality, and has never yet held communion with, nor been made partaker of, the Word, in any of the real relations signified by each of these names which He bears?</p>

<p>99. Who, in fine, is the man who, although he has never applied himself to, nor learned to speak, the hidden wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note312869"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:17</a></span> although he is still a babe, still fed with milk,  still of those who are not numbered in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note312871"><a href="../bible/num001.htm#verse3">Numbers&nbsp;1:3</a></span> nor enrolled in the army of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although he is not yet able to take up the Cross of Christ like a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, although he is possibly not yet one of the more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> members, yet will joyfully and eagerly accept his appointment as head of the fullness of Christ? <span class="stiki" id="note312872"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse23">Ephesians&nbsp;1:23</a></span> No one, if he will listen to my judgment and accept my advice! This is of all things most to be feared, this is the extremest of dangers in the eyes of everyone who understands the magnitude of success, the utter ruin of failure.</p>

<p>100. Let others sail for merchandise, I used to say, and cross the wide oceans, and constantly contend with winds and waves, to gain great <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, if so it should chance, and run great risks in their eagerness for sailing and merchandise; but, for my part, I greatly prefer to stay ashore and plough a short but pleasant furrow, saluting at a respectful distance the sea and its gains, to live as best I can upon a poor and scanty store of barley-bread, and drag my life along in safety and calm, rather than expose myself to so long and great a risk for the sake of great gains.</p>

<p>101. For one in high estate, if he fail to make further progress and to disseminate <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> still more widely, and contents himself with slight results, incurs punishment, as having spent a great light upon the illumination of a little house, or girt round the limbs of a boy the full armor of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. On the contrary, a man of low estate may with safety assume a light burden, and escape the risk of the ridicule and increased danger which would attend him if he attempted a task beyond his powers. For, as we have heard, it is not seemly for a man to build a tower, unless he has sufficient to finish it. <span class="stiki" id="note312873"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;14:28</a></span> </p>

<p>102. Such is the defence which I have been able to make, perhaps at immoderate length, for my flight. Such are the reasons which, to my pain and possibly to yours, carried me away from you, my friends and brothers; yet, as it seemed to me at the time, with irresistible force. My longing after you, and the sense of your longing for me, have, more than anything  else, led to my return, for nothing inclines us so strongly to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> as mutual affection.</p>

<p>103. In the next place there was my care, my duty, the hoar hairs and weakness of my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, who were more greatly distressed on my account than by their advanced age&mdash; of this Patriarch <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> whose person is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by me, and numbered among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and of Sarah, who travailed in my spiritual birth by instructing me in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now, I had specially pledged myself to become the stay of their old age and the support of their weakness, a pledge which, to the best of my power, I have fulfilled, even at the expense of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> itself, the most precious of possessions and titles to me; or, to speak more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, although I made it the first object of my <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to appear to be no <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, I could not bear that my labor in consequence of a single purpose should be wasted, nor yet that blessing should be lost, which one of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of old is said to have stolen from his father, whom he deceived by the food which he offered to him, and the hairy appearance he assumed, thus attaining a good object by disgraceful trickery. <span class="stiki" id="note312874"><a href="../bible/gen027.htm#verse21">Genesis&nbsp;27:21</a>,&nbsp;sq</span> These are the two causes of my submission and tractability. Nor is it, perchance, unreasonable that my arguments should yield and submit to them both, for there is a time to be conquered, as I also think there is for every purpose, <span class="stiki" id="note312875"><a href="../bible/ecc003.htm#verse1">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;3:1</a></span> and it is better to be honorably overcome than to win a dangerous and lawless victory.</p>

<p>104. There is a third reason of the highest importance which I will further mention, and then dismiss the rest. I remembered the days of old,  and, recurring to one of the ancient histories, drew counsel for myself therefrom as to my present conduct; for let us not suppose these events to have been recorded without a purpose, nor that they are a mere assemblage of words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> gathered together for the pastime of those who listen to them, as a kind of bait for the ears, for the sole purpose of giving pleasure. Let us leave such jesting to the legends and the Greeks, who think but little of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and enchant ear and mind by the charm of their fictions and the daintiness of their style.</p>

<p>105. We however, who extend the accuracy of the Spirit to the merest stroke and tittle, <span class="stiki" id="note312877"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;5:18</a></span> will never admit the impious assertion that even the smallest matters were dealt with haphazard by those who have recorded them, and have thus been borne in mind down to the present day: on the contrary, their purpose has been to supply memorials and instructions for our consideration under similar circumstances, should such befall us, and that the examples of the past might serve as rules and models, for our warning and imitation.</p>

<p>106. What then is the story, and wherein lies its application? For, perhaps, it would not be amiss to relate it, for the general security. Jonah also was fleeing from the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note312878"><a href="../bible/jon001.htm#verse3">Jonah&nbsp;1:3</a></span> or rather, thought that he was fleeing: but he was overtaken by the sea, and the storm, and the lot, and the whale's belly, and the three days' entombment, the type of a greater <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. He fled from having to announce the dread and awful message to the Ninevites, and from being subsequently, if the city was saved by repentance, convicted of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>: not that he was displeased at the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but he was ashamed of being made an instrument of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, and exceedingly <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the credit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, which was in danger of being destroyed in his person, since most men are unable to penetrate the depth of the Divine dispensation in such cases.</p>

<p>107. But, as I have learned from a man  skilled in these subjects, and able to grasp the depth of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, by means of a reasonable explanation of what seems unreasonable in the history, it was not this which caused Jonah to flee, and carried him to Joppa and again from Joppa to Tarshish, when he entrusted his stolen self to the sea: <span class="stiki" id="note312880"><a href="../bible/jon001.htm#verse3">Jonah&nbsp;1:3</a></span> for it was not likely that such a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> should be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the design of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, viz., to bring about, by means of the threat, the escape of the Ninevites from the threatened doom, according to His great wisdom, and unsearchable judgments, and according to His ways which are beyond our tracing and finding out; <span class="stiki" id="note312881"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse33">Romans&nbsp;11:33</a></span> nor that, if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this he would refuse to co-operate with God in the use of the means which He designed for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Besides, to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that Jonah hoped to hide himself at sea, and escape by his flight the great eye of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is surely utterly absurd and stupid, and unworthy of credit, not only in the case of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, but even in the case of any sensible man, who has only a slight perception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose power is over all.</p>

<p>108. On the contrary, as my instructor said, and as I am myself convinced, Jonah <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> better than any one the purpose of his message to the Ninevites, and that, in planning his flight, although he changed his place, he did not escape from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nor is this possible for any one else, either by concealing himself in the bosom of the earth, or in the depths of the sea, or by soaring on wings, if there be any means of doing so, and rising into the air, or by abiding in the lowest depths of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>,  or by enveloping himself in a thick cloud, or by any other of the many devices for ensuring escape. For God alone of all things cannot be escaped from or contended with; if He wills to seize and bring them under His hand, He outstrips the swift, He outwits the wise, He overthrows the strong, He abases the lofty, He subdues rashness, He represses power.</p>

<p>109. Jonah then was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the mighty hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with which he threatened other men, nor did he <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that he could utterly escape the Divine power; this we are not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: but when he saw the falling away of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and perceived the passing over of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>&mdash; this was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his retirement from preaching and of his delay in fulfilling the command; accordingly he left the watchtower of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, for this is the meaning of Joppa in Hebrew, I mean his former dignity and <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, and flung himself into the deep of sorrow: and hence he is tempest-tossed, and falls asleep, and is wrecked, and aroused from sleep, and taken by lot, and confesses his flight, and is cast into sea, and swallowed, but not destroyed, by the whale; but there he calls upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, marvellous as it is, on the third day he, like Christ, is delivered: but my treatment of this topic must stand over, and shall shortly, if God permit, be more deliberately worked out. </p>

<p>110. Now however, to return to my original point, the thought and question occurred to me, that although he might possibly meet with some indulgence, if reluctant to prophesy, for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which I mentioned&mdash; yet, in my own case, what could be said, what defence could be made, if I longer remained restive, and rejected the yoke of ministry, which, though I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether to call it light or heavy, had at any rate been laid upon me.</p>

<p>111. For if it be granted, and this alone can be strongly asserted in such matters, that we are far too low to perform the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> office before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that we can only be worthy of the sanctuary after we have become worthy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,  and worthy of the post of president, after being worthy of the sanctuary, yet some one else may perhaps refuse to acquit us on the charge of disobedience. Now terrible are the threatenings against disobedience, and terrible are the penalties which ensue upon it; as indeed are those on the other side, if, instead of being reluctant, and shrinking back, and concealing ourselves as Saul did among his father's stuff <span class="stiki" id="note312885"><a href="../bible/1sa010.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;10:22</a></span> &mdash; although called to rule but for a short time&mdash; if, I say, we come forward readily, as though to a slight and most easy task, whereas it is not safe even to resign it, nor to amend by second thoughts our first.</p>

<p>112. On this account I had much toilsome consideration to discover my duty, being set in the midst between two fears, of which the one held me back, the other urged me on. For a long while I was at a loss between them, and after wavering from side to side, and, like a current driven by inconstant winds, inclining first in this direction, then in that, I at last yielded to the stronger, and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of disobedience overcame me, and has carried me off. Pray, mark how accurately and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> I hold the balance between the fears, neither desiring an office not given to me, nor rejecting it when given. The one course marks the rash, the other the disobedient, both the undisciplined. My position lies between those who are too bold, or too timid; more timid than those who rush at every position, more bold than those who avoid them all. This is my judgment on the matter.</p>

<p>113. Moreover, to distinguish still more clearly between them, we have, against the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of office, a possible help in the law of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, inasmuch as God in His goodness rewards our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and makes a perfect ruler of the man who has confidence in Him, and places all his hopes in Him; but against the danger of disobedience I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of nothing which can help us, and of no ground to encourage our confidence. For it is to be feared that we shall have to hear these words concerning those who have been entrusted to us: I will require their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> at your hands; <span class="stiki" id="note312886"><a href="../bible/eze003.htm#verse18">Ezekiel&nbsp;3:18</a></span> and, Because you have rejected me, and not been leaders and rulers of my people, I also will reject you, that I should not be king over you;  and, As ye refused to hearken to My voice, and turned a stubborn back, and were disobedient, so shall it be when you call upon Me, and I will not regard nor give ear to your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.  God forbid that these words should come to us from the just Judge, for when we sing of His mercy we must also by all means sing of His judgment. </p>

<p>114. I resort once again to history, and on considering the men of best repute in ancient days, who were ever preferred by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the office of ruler or <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, I discover that some readily complied with the call, others deprecated the gift, and that neither those who drew back were blamed for timidity, nor those who came forward for eagerness. The former stood in awe of the greatness of the ministry, the latter trustfully <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> Him Who called them. <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> was eager, but <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> resisted,  Isaiah readily submitted, but Jeremiah was afraid of his youth, <span class="stiki" id="note312891"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;6:8</a></span> and did not venture to prophesy until he had received from God a promise and power beyond his years. <span class="stiki" id="note312892"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse6">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:6</a></span> </p>

<p>115. By these arguments I charmed myself, and by degrees my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> relaxed and became ductile, like iron, and time came to the aid of my arguments, and the testimonies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to which I had entrusted my whole life, were my counsellors.  Therefore I was not rebellious, neither turned away back, <span class="stiki" id="note312894"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;50:6</a></span> says my Lord, when, instead of being called to rule, He was led, as a sheep to the slaughter;  but I fell down and humbled myself under the mighty hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note312896"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:6</a></span> and asked pardon for my former idleness and disobedience, if this is at all laid to my charge. I held my peace, <span class="stiki" id="note312897"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;42:14</a></span> but I will not hold my peace for ever: I withdrew for a little while,  till I had considered myself and consoled my grief: but now I am commissioned to exalt Him in the congregation of the people, and praise Him in the seat of the elders.  If my former conduct deserved blame, my present action merits pardon.</p>

<p>116. What further need is there of words.

Lead me with your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, guide me with your words, establish me with your spirit.
