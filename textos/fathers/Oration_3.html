<h1>Oration 3</h1>

<p><strong>To Those Who Had Invited Him, and Not Come to Receive Him.</strong></p>

<p><strong>(About Easter A.D. 362.)</strong></p>

<p>I. How slow you are, my friends and brethren, to come to listen to my words, though you were so swift in tyrannizing over me, and tearing me from my Citadel Solitude, which I had embraced in preference to everything else, and as coadjutress and mother of the divine ascent, and as deifying man,  I had especially admired, and had set before me as the guide of my whole life.  How is it that, now you have got it, you thus despise what you so greatly desired to obtain, and seem to be better able to desire the absent than to enjoy the present; as though you preferred to <em>possess</em> my teaching rather than to <em>profit</em> by it? Yes, I may even say this to you: <q>I became a surfeit unto you before you tasted of me, or gave me a trial</q> <span class="stiki" id="note312922"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;1:14</a></span> &mdash; which is most strange.</p>

<p>II. And neither did you entertain me as a guest, nor, if I may make a remark of a more compassionate kind, did you allow yourselves to be entertained by me, reverencing this command if nothing else; nor did you take me by the hand, as beginning a new task; nor encourage me in my timidity, nor console me for the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> I had suffered; but&mdash; I shrink from saying it, though say it I must&mdash; you made my festival no festival, and received me with no <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> introduction; and you mingled the solemn festival with sorrow, because it lacked that which most of all would have contributed to its <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, the presence of you my conquerors, for it would not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to call you people who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me. So easily is anything despised which is easily conquered, and the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> receives attention, while he who is <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> before God is slighted.</p>

<p>III. What will you? Shall I be judged by you, or shall I be your judge? Shall I pass a verdict, or receive one, for I hope to be acquitted if I be judged, and if I give sentence, to give it against you <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>? The charge against you is that you do not answer my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with equal measure, nor do you repay my <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, nor do you pledge the future to me by your present alacrity&mdash; though even if you had, I could hardly have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it. But each of you has something which he prefers to both the old and the new Pastor, neither reverencing the grey hairs of the one, nor calling out the youthful spirit of the other.</p>

<p>IV. There is a Banquet in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note312923"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;14:16</a></span> and a hospitable Host and friends; and the Banquet is most pleasant, for it is the marriage of His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. He calls them, but they come not: He is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and&mdash; I pass over the interval for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of bad omen&mdash; but, to speak gently, He fills the Banquet with others. God forbid that this should be your case; but yet you have treated me (how shall I put it gently?) with as much haughtiness or boldness as they who after being called to a feast rise up against it, and insult their host; for you, though you are not of the number of those who are without, or are invited to the marriage, but are yourselves those who invited me, and bound me to the Holy Table, and showed me the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Bridal Chamber, then deserted me (this is the most splendid thing about you)&mdash; one to his field, another to his newly bought yoke of oxen, another to his just-married wife, another to some other trifling matter; you were all scattered and dispersed, caring little for the Bridechamber and the Bridegroom. <span class="stiki" id="note312924"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;22:10</a></span> </p>

<p>V. On this account I was filled with despondency and perplexity&mdash; for I will not keep silence about what I have suffered&mdash; and I was very near withholding the discourse which I was minded to bestow as a Marriage-gift, the most beautiful and precious of all I had; and I very nearly let it loose upon you, whom, now that the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> had once been done to me, I greatly longed for: for I thought I could get from this a splendid theme, and because my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> sharpened my tongue&mdash; <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is very hot and ready for accusation when it is stirred to jealousy by grief which it conceives from some unexpected neglect. If any of you has been pierced with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love's</a> sting, and has felt himself neglected, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the feeling, and will pardon one who so suffers, because he himself has been near the same frenzy.</p>

<p>VI. But it is not permitted to me at the present time to say to you anything upbraiding; and God forbid I ever should. And even now perhaps I have reproached you more than in due measure, the Sacred Flock, the praise-worthy nurselings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Divine inheritance; by which, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, You are rich, even were Thou poor in all other respects. To You, I think, are fitting those words, <q>The lot is fallen unto You in a fair ground: yea You have the goodliest heritage.</q>  Nor will I allow that the most populous cities or the broadest flocks have any advantage over us, the little ones of the smallest of all the tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, of the least of the thousands of Judah, <span class="stiki" id="note312926"><a href="../bible/1sa023.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;23:23</a></span> of the little <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> among cities, <span class="stiki" id="note312927"><a href="../bible/mic005.htm#verse2">Micah&nbsp;5:2</a></span> where Christ was born and is from the beginning well-known and worshipped;  among those whom the Father is exalted, and the Son is held to be equal to Him, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> with Them: we who are of one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, who mind the same thing, who in nothing injure the Trinity, neither by preferring One Person above another, nor by cutting off any: as those bad umpires and measurers of the Godhead do, who by magnifying One Person more than is fit, diminish and insult the whole.</p>

<p>VII. But do ye also, if you bear me any good will&mdash; ye who are my husbandry, my vineyard, my own bowels, or rather His Who is our common Father, for in Christ he has begotten you through the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> &mdash; show to us also some respect. It is only fair, since we have honoured you above all else: you are my witnesses, ye, and they who have placed in our hands this&mdash; shall I say <em>Authority</em>, or <em>Service</em>? And if to him that loves most is due, how shall I measure the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, for which I have made you my debtors by my own <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Rather, show respect for yourselves, and the Image committed to your care, <span class="stiki" id="note312929"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse27">Genesis&nbsp;1:27</a></span> and Him Who committed it, and the Sufferings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and your hopes therefrom, holding fast the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which you have received, and in which you were brought up, by which also you are being saved, and trust to save others (for not many, be well assured, can boast of what you can), and reckoning <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to consist, not in often speaking about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in silence for the most part, for the tongue is a dangerous thing to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, if it be not governed by reason. Believe that listening is always less dangerous than talking, just as learning about God is more pleasant than teaching. Leave the more accurate search into these questions to those who are the Stewards of the Word; and for yourselves, worship a little in words, but more by your actions, and rather by keeping the Law than by admiring the Lawgiver; show your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Him by fleeing from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, pursuing after <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, living in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, walking in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, drawing your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from Him, building upon the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not wood or hay or stubble, <span class="stiki" id="note312930"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:12</a></span> weak materials and easily spent when the fire shall try our works or destroy them; but gold, silver, precious stones, which remain and stand.</p>

<p>VIII. So may you act, and so may you <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> us, whether present or absent, whether taking your part in our sermons, or preferring to do something else: and may you be the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, pure and unblamable, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation: <span class="stiki" id="note312931"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> and may you never be entangled in the snares of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> that go round about, or bound with the chain of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. May the Word in you never be smothered with cares of this life and so ye become unfruitful: but may you walk in the King's Highway, turning aside neither to the right hand nor to the left,  but led by the Spirit through the strait gate. Then all our affairs shall prosper, both now and at the inquest There, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, to Whom be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
