<h1>Oration 34</h1>

<p><strong>On the Arrival of the Egyptians.</strong></p>

<p> <em>This</em> <em>Oration was preached at Constantinople in 380, under the following circumstances: Peter, Patriarch of Alexandria, had sent a mission of five of his Suffragans to consecrate the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a> Maximus to the Throne occupied by Gregory. This had led to much trouble, but in the end the intruder had been expelled and banished. Shortly afterwards an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> fleet, probably the regular grain ships, had arrived at Constantinople, apparently on the day before a Festival. The crews of the ships, landing next day to go to Church, passed by the numerous Churches held by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, and betook themselves to the little Anastasia. S. Gregory felt himself moved to congratulate them specially on such an act, after what had recently passed, and accordingly pronounced the following discourse.</em></p>

<p>I. I will address myself as is right to those who have come from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; for they have come here eagerly, having overcome illwill by <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, from that <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> which is enriched by the River, raining out of the earth, and like the sea in its season&mdash;if I too may follow in my small measure those who have so eloquently spoken of these matters; and which is also enriched by Christ my Lord, Who once was a fugitive into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and now is supplied by <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; the first, when He fled from <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> massacre of the children; <span class="stiki" id="note313788"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;2:13</a></span> and now by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the fathers for their children, by Christ the new Food of those who hunger after good; <span class="stiki" id="note313789"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;6:33</a></span> the greatest <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of grain of which history speaks and men <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; the Bread which came down from heaven and gives life to the world, that life which is indestructible and indissoluble, concerning Whom I now seem to hear the Father saying, Out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> have I called My Son. <span class="stiki" id="note313790"><a href="../bible/hos011.htm#verse1">Hosea&nbsp;11:1</a></span> </p>

<p>II. For from you has sounded forth the Word to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; healthfully <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and preached; and you are the best bringers of fruit of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, specially of those who now hold the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, as far as I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, who am not only a lover of such food, but also its distributor, and not at home only but also abroad. For you indeed supply bodily food to peoples and cities so far as your lovingkindness reaches; and you supply spiritual food also, not to a particular people, nor to this or that city, circumscribed by narrow boundaries, though its people may think it very illustrious, but to almost the whole world. And you bring the remedy not for famine of bread or thirst of water, <span class="stiki" id="note313791"><a href="../bible/amo008.htm#verse11">Amos&nbsp;8:11</a></span> which is no very terrible famine&mdash; and to avoid it is easy; but to a famine of hearing the Word of the Lord, which it is most miserable to suffer, and a most laborious matter to cure at the present time, because iniquity has abounded, <span class="stiki" id="note313792"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;24:12</a></span> and scarce anywhere do I find its genuine healers.</p>

<p>III. Such was Joseph your Superintendent of grain measures, whom I may call ours also; who by his surpassing wisdom was able both to foresee the famine and to cure it by decrees of government, healing the ill-favoured and starving cattle by means of the fair and fat.  And indeed you may understand by Joseph which you will, either the great lover and creator and namesake of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> or his successor in throne and word and hoary hair, our new Peter,  not inferior in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or fame to him by whom the middle course was destroyed and crushed, though it still wriggles a little weakly, like the tail of a snake after it is cut off; the one of whom, after having departed this life in a good old age after many conflicts and wrestlings, looks upon us from above, I well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and reaches a hand to those who are labouring for the right: and this the more, in proportion as he is freed from his bonds; and the other is hastening to the same end or dissolution of life, and is already drawing near the dwellers in heaven, but is still so far in the flesh as is needed to give the last aids to the Word, and to take his journey with richer provision.</p>

<p>IV. Of these great men and doctors and soldiers of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and victors, you are the nurslings and offspring; of these neither times nor tyrants, reason nor <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, nor accuser, nor slanderer, whether waging open <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against them, or plotting secretly; nor any who appeared to be of our side, nor any stranger, nor gold&mdash; that hidden tyrant, through which now almost everything is turned upside down and made to depend on the hazard of a die; nor flatteries nor threats, nor long and distant exiles (for they only could not be affected by confiscation, because of their great riches, which were&mdash; to possess nothing) nor anything else, whether absent or present or expected, could induce to take the worse part, and to be anywise traitor to the Trinity, or to suffer loss of the Godhead. On the contrary indeed, they grew strong by dangers, and became more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. For to suffer thus for Christ adds to one's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and is as it were an earnest to high-souled men of further conflicts. These, O <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, are your present tales and wonders.</p>

<p>V. Once you praised me your Mendesian Goats, and your Memphite Apis, a fatted and fleshy calf, and the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of Isis, and the mutilations of Osiris, and your venerable Serapis, a log that was honoured by myths and ages and the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of its worshippers, as some unknown and heavenly matter, however it may have been aided by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>; and things yet more shameful than these, multiform images of monstrous beasts and creeping things, all of which Christ and the heralds of Christ have conquered, both the others who have been illustrious in their own times, and also the Fathers whom I have named just now; by whom, O admirable country, you are more famous today than all others put together, whether in ancient or modern history.</p>

<p>VI. Wherefore I embrace and salute you, O noblest of peoples and most <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and of warmest <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and worthy of your leaders; for I can find nothing greater to say of you than this, nor anything by which better to welcome you. And I greet you, to a small extent with my tongue, but very heartily with the movements of my affections. <span class="stiki" id="note313795"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse9">Galatians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> O my people, for I call you mine, as of one mind and one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, instructed by the same Fathers, and adoring the same Trinity. My people, for mine you are, though it seem not so to those who <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> me. And that they who are in this case may be the deeper wounded, see, I give the right hand of fellowship before so many witnesses, seen and unseen. And I put away the old <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> by this new act of kindness. O my people, for mine you are, though in saying so I, who am least of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, am claiming for myself that which is greatest. For such is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit that it makes of equal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> those who are of one mind. O my people, for mine you are, though it be afar, because we are divinely joined together, <span class="stiki" id="note313796"><a href="../bible/isa062.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;62:4</a></span> and in a manner wholly different to the unions of carnal people; for bodies are united in place, but <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are fitted together by the Spirit. O my people, who formerly studied how to suffer for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but now if you will hearken unto me, wilt study not to do anything, but to consider the power of doing to be a sufficient gain, and to deem that you are offering a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as in those days of your endurance so in these of meekness. O people to whom the Lord has prepared Himself to do good, as to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to your enemies.  O people, whom the Lord has chosen to Himself out of all peoples; O people who art graven upon the hands of the Lord, to whom says the Lord, You are My Will; and, Your gates are carved work, and all the rest that is said to them that are being saved. O people&mdash;nay, marvel not at my insatiability that I repeat your name so often; for I delight in this continual naming of you, like those who can never have enough of their enjoyment of certain spectacles or sounds.</p>

<p>VII. But, O people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and mine, beautiful also was your yesterday's assembly, which you held upon the sea, and pleasant, if any sight ever was, to the eyes, when I saw the sea like a forest, and hidden by a cloud made with hands, and the beauty and speed of your ships, as though ordered for a procession, and the slight breeze astern, as though purposely escorting you, and wafting to the City your city of the Sea. Yet the present assembly which we now behold is more beautiful and more magnificent. For you have not hastened to mingle with the larger number, nor have you reckoned religion by numbers, nor endured to be a mere unorganized rabble, rather than a people purified by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>; but having, as is right, rendered to C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's, you have offered besides to God the things that are God's; to the former Custom, to the latter Fear; and after feeding the people with your cargoes, you yourselves have come to be fed by us. For we also distribute grain, and our distribution is perhaps not worth less than yours. Come eat of my Bread and drink of the Wine which I have mingled for you. <span class="stiki" id="note313798"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse5">Proverbs&nbsp;9:5</a></span> I join with Wisdom in bidding you to my table. For I commend your good feeling, and I hasten to meet your ready <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, because ye came to us as to your own harbour, running to your like; and you valued the kindred Faith, and thought it monstrous that, while they who insult higher things are in harmony with each other and think alike, and think to make good each man's individual <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> by their common conspiracy, like ropes which get strength from being twisted together; yet you should not meet nor combine with those who are of the same <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, with whom it is more reasonable that you should associate, for we gather in the Godhead also. And that you may see that not in vain have you come to us, and that you have not brought up in a port among strangers and foreigners, but among your own people, and have been well guided by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; we will discourse to you briefly concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and do you recognize your own, like those who distinguish their kindred by the ensigns of their arms.</p>

<p>VIII. I find two highest differences in things that exist, viz.:&mdash; Rule, and Service; not such as among us either tyranny has cut or poverty has severed, but which nature has distinguished, if any like to use this word. For That which is First is also above nature. Of these the former is creative, and originating, and unchangeable; but the other is created, and subject and changing; or to speak yet more plainly, the one is above time, and the other subject to time. The Former is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and subsists in Three Greatest, namely, the Cause, the Creator, and the Perfecter; I mean the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who are neither so separated from one another as to be divided in nature, nor so contracted as to be circumscribed by a single person; the one alternative being that of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, the other that of the Sabellian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; but they are on the one hand more single than what is altogether divided, and on the other more abundant than what is altogether singular. The other division is with us, and is called Creation, though one may be exalted above another according to the proportion of their nearness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>IX. This being so, if any be on the Lord's side let him come with us, <span class="stiki" id="note313799"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse26">Exodus&nbsp;32:26</a></span> and let us adore the One Godhead in the Three; not ascribing any name of humiliation to the unapproachable Glory, but having the exaltations of the Triune God continually in our mouth.  For since we cannot properly describe even the greatness of Its Nature, on account of Its infinity and undefinableness, how can we assert of It humiliation? But if any one be estranged from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore divides the One Supreme Substance into an inequality of Natures, it were marvellous if such an one were not cut in sunder by the sword, and his portion appointed with the unbelievers, <span class="stiki" id="note313801"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;12:46</a></span> reaping any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thought both now and hereafter.</p>

<p>X. What must we say of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Whom by common consent all who have been preoccupied with natural conceptions share, although He has endured the beginnings of dishonour, having been first divided by ancient innovation into the Good and the Creator. And of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, see how simply and concisely we shall discourse. If any one could say of Either that He was mutable or subject to change; or that either in time, or place, or power, or energy He could be measured; or that He was not naturally good, or not Self-moved, or not a free agent, or a Minister, or a Hymnsinger; or that He feared, or was a recipient of freedom, or was not counted with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; let him prove this and we will acquiesce, and will be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the Majesty of our Fellow Servants, though we lose our God. But if all that the Father has belongs likewise to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, except Causality; and all that is the Son's belongs also to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, except His Sonship, and whatsoever is spoken of Him as to Incarnation for me a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and for my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that, taking of mine, He may impart His own by this new commingling; then cease your babbling, though so late, O you sophists of vain talk that falls at once to the ground; for why will you die O House of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note313802"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse31">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:31</a></span> &mdash; if I may mourn for you in the words of Scripture.</p>

<p>XI. For my part I revere also the Titles of the Word, which are so many, and so high and great, which even the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> respect. And I revere also the Equal Rank of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; and I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the threat pronounced against those who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> Him. And <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is not the reckoning Him <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the severing Him from the Godhead. And here you must remark that That which is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> is Lord, and That which is avenged is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, evidently as Lord. I cannot bear to be unenlightened after my Enlightenment, by marking with a different stamp any of the Three into Whom I was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and thus to be indeed buried in the water, and initiated not into Regeneration, but into death.</p>

<p>XII. I dare to utter something, O Trinity; and may pardon be granted to my folly, for the risk is to my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. I too am an Image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of the Heavenly Glory, though I be placed on earth. I cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that I am saved by one who is my equal. If the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let Him first be made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and then let Him deify me His equal. But now what deceit this is on the part of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, or rather of the givers of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God and to come away godless; by one set of questions and confessions leading to another set of conclusions. Alas for this fair fame, if after the Laver I am blackened, if I am to see those who are not yet cleansed brighter than myself; if I am cheated by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of my Baptizer; if I seek for the stronger Spirit and find Him not. Give me a second Font before you think <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the first. Why do you grudge me a complete regeneration? Why do you make me, who am the Temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the habitation of a creature? Why do you <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> part of what belongs to me, and dishonour part, judging <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> of the Godhead, to cut me off from the Gift, or rather to cut me in two by the gift? Either <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Whole, or dishonour the Whole, O new Theologian, that, if you are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, you may at any rate be consistent with yourself, and not judge unequally of an equal nature.</p>

<p>XIII. To sum up my discourse:&mdash; Glorify Him with the Cherubim, who unite the Three Holies into One Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note313803"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;6:3</a></span> and so far indicate the Primal Substance as their wings open to the diligent. With David be enlightened, who said to the Light, In Your Light shall we see Light,  that is, in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> we shall see the Son; and what can be of further reaching ray? With John thunder, sounding forth nothing that is low or earthly concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but what is high and heavenly, Who is in the beginning, and is with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note313805"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Father, and not a good fellow-servant honoured only with the title of Son; and the Other Comforter (other, that is, from the Speaker, Who was the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>). And when you read, I and the Father are One,  keep before your eyes the Unity of Substance; but when you see, <q>We will come to him, and make Our abode with him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note313807"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;14:23</a></span> remember the distinction of Persons; and when you see the Names, Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, think of the Three Personalities.</p>

<p>XIV. With Luke be inspired as you study the Acts of the Apostles. Why do you range yourself with Ananias and Sapphira, those vain embezzlers (if indeed the theft of one's own property be a vain thing) and that by appropriating, not silver nor any other cheap and worthless thing, like a wedge of gold, <span class="stiki" id="note313808"><a href="../bible/jos007.htm#verse21">Joshua&nbsp;7:21</a></span> or a didrachma, as did of old a rapacious soldier; but stealing the Godhead Itself, and lying, not to men but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as you have heard. What? Will you not reverence even the authority of the Spirit Who breathes upon whom, and when, and as He wills? He comes upon Cornelius and his companions before Baptism, to others after Baptism, by the hands of the Apostles; so that from both sides, both from the fact that He comes in the guise of a Master and not of a Servant, and from the fact of His being sought to make perfect, the Godhead of the Spirit is testified.</p>

<p>XV.
