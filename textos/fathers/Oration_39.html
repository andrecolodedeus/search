<h1>Oration 39</h1>

<p><strong>Oration on the Holy Lights.</strong></p>

<p> <em>The</em> <em>Oration on the Holy Lights was preached on the Festival of the Epiphany 381, and was followed the next day by that on Baptism. In the Eastern Church this Festival is regarded as more particularly the commemoration of our Lord's Baptism, and is accordingly one of the great days for the solemn ministration of the Sacrament. It is generally called Theophania</em>,  <em>and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in the Liturgy is S. <a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse13">Matthew iii. 13-17</a>. The Sunday in the Octave is called</em> <em><span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x1F70; &#x03C4;&#x1F70; &#x03C6;&#x1FF6;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span> </em> <em>(After The Lights), pointing to a time when the Feast was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the <q>Holy Lights,</q> as seems to have been the case in S. Gregory's day. This name is derived from Baptism, which was often in ancient days called Illumination, in reference to which name (derived from the spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Sacrament) lighted torches or candles were carried by the neophytes. It would appear that the solemnites of the Festival lasted two days, of which the second was devoted to the solemn conferring of the Sacrament. Accordingly we find two Orations belonging to the Festival. In the first, delivered on the Day itself he dwells more especially on the Feast and the Mystery of our Lord's Baptism therein commemorated; and proceeds to speak of the different kinds of Baptism, of which he enumerates Five, viz.:&mdash; </em></p>

<ul>
<li>The figurative Baptism of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the cloud and in the Sea.</li>
<li>The preparatory Baptism of repentance ministered by S. John the Baptist.</li>
<li>The spiritual Baptism of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> given us by our Lord.</li>
<li>The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Baptism of Martyrdom.</li>
<li>The painful Baptism of Penance.</li>
</ul>

<p>In speaking of this last he takes occasion to refute the extreme rigorism of the followers of Novatus, who denied absolution to certain classes of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed after Baptism.</p>

<p>In the second Oration, delivered next day, he dwells on the Sacrament of Baptism and its spiritual effects; and takes occasion to reprove the then still prevalent practice of deferring Baptism till the near approach of death. He likewise dwells on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that the validity and spiritual effect of the Sacrament is wholly independent of the rank or worthiness of the Priest who may minister it; and he concludes with a sketch of the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> which its reception involves, with a very valuable exposition of the Creed, and of the Ceremonies which accompanied the administration of the Sacrament.</p>

<p>I. Again My <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and again a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>; not deceitful nor disorderly, nor belonging to Greek <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> (for so I call their solemnities, and so I think will every man of sound sense); but a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> lofty and divine, and allied to the Glory above. For the Holy Day of the Lights, to which we have come, and which we are celebrating today, has for its origin the Baptism of my Christ, the True Light That lightens every man that comes into the world, <span class="stiki" id="note313909"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;1:9</a></span> and effects my purification, and assists that light which we received from the beginning from Him from above, but which we darkened and confused by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>II. Therefore listen to the Voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which sounds so exceeding clearly to me, who am both <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> and master of these <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, as would to God it may sound to you; I Am The Light Of The World. <span class="stiki" id="note313910"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;8:12</a></span> Therefore approach ye to Him and be enlightened, and let not your faces be ashamed,  being signed with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light. It is a season of new birth, <span class="stiki" id="note313912"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;3:3</a></span> let us be born again. It is a time of reformation, let us receive again the first Adam.  Let us not remain what we are, but let us become what we once were. The Light Shines In Darkness,  in this life and in the flesh, and is chased by the darkness, but is not overtaken by it:&mdash; I mean the adverse power leaping up in its shamelessness against the visible Adam, but encountering God and being defeated&mdash;in order that we, putting away the darkness, may draw near to the Light, and may then become perfect Light, the children of perfect Light. See the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of this Day; see the power of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. Are you not lifted up from the earth? Are you not clearly placed on high, being exalted by our voice and meditation? And you will be placed much higher when the Word shall have prospered the course of my words.</p>

<p>III. Is there any such among the shadowy purifications of the Law, aiding as it did with temporary sprinklings, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean;  or do the gentiles celebrate any such thing in their <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, every ceremony and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of which to me is nonsense, and a dark invention of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and a figment of an unhappy <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, aided by time, and hidden by fable? For what they worship as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, they veil as mythical. But if these things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, they ought not to be called myths, but to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> not to be shameful; <span class="stiki" id="note313916"><a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse13">Hebrews&nbsp;7:13</a></span> and if they are false, they ought not to be objects of wonder; nor ought people so inconsiderately to hold the most contrary opinions about the same thing, as if they were playing in the market-place with boys or really ill-disposed men, not engaged in discussion with men of sense, and worshippers of the Word, though despisers of this artificial plausibility.</p>

<p>IV. We are not concerned in these <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> with birth of Zeus and thefts of the Cretan Tyrant  (though the Greeks may be displeased at such a title for him), nor with the name of Curetes, and the armed dances, which were to hide the wailings of a weeping god, that he might escape from his father's <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>. For indeed it would be a strange thing that he who was swallowed as a stone should be made to weep as a child.  Nor are we concerned with Phrygian mutilations and flutes and Corybantes,  and all the ravings of men concerning Rhea, consecrating people to the mother of the gods, and being initiated into such ceremonies as befit the mother of such gods as these. Nor have we any carrying away of the Maiden,  nor wandering of Demeter, nor her intimacy with Celei and Triptolemi and Dragons; nor her doings and sufferings...for I am ashamed to bring into daylight that ceremony of the night, and to make a sacred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of obscenity. Eleusis <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> these things, and so do those who are eyewitnesses of what is there guarded by silence, and well worthy of it. Nor is our commemoration one of Dionysus, and the thigh that travailed with an incomplete birth, as before a head had travailed with another;  nor of the hermaphrodite god, nor a chorus of the drunken and enervated host; nor of the folly of the Thebans which honours him; nor the thunderbolt of Semele which they adore. Nor is it the harlot <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of Aphrodite, who, as they themselves admit, was basely born and basely honoured; nor have we here Phalli and Ithyphalli,  shameful both in form and action; nor Taurian massacres of strangers;  nor blood of Laconian youths shed upon the altars, as they scourged themselves with the whips;  and in this case alone use their <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> badly, who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> a goddess, and her a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. For these same people both <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> effeminacy, and worship boldness.</p>

<p>V. And where will you place the butchery of Pelops,  which feasted hungry gods, that bitter and inhuman hospitality? Where the horrible and dark spectres of Hecate, and the underground puerilities and sorceries of Trophonius, or the babblings of the Dodon&aelig;an Oak, or the trickeries of the Delphian tripod, or the prophetic draught of Castalia, which could prophesy anything, except their own being brought to silence?  Nor is it the sacrificial art of <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, and their entrail forebodings, nor the Chald&aelig;an astronomy and horoscopes, comparing our lives with the movements of the heavenly bodies, which cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even what they are themselves, or shall be. Nor are these Thracian orgies, from which the word Worship (<span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03C1;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>) is said to be derived; nor <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of Orpheus, whom the Greeks admired so much for his wisdom that they devised for him a lyre which draws all things by its music. Nor the tortures of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a>  which it is just that those who can endure to be initiated into such things should suffer; nor the manglings of Osiris,  another calamity honoured by the Egyptians; nor the ill-fortunes of Isis  and the goats more venerable than the Mendesians, and the stall of Apis,  the calf that luxuriated in the folly of the Memphites, nor all those honours with which they outrage the Nile, while themselves proclaiming it in song to be the Giver of fruits and grain, and the measurer of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> by its cubits. </p>

<p>VI. I pass over the honours they pay to reptiles,  and their worship of vile things, each of which has its peculiar cultus and festival, and all share in a common devilishness; so that, if they were absolutely bound to be ungodly, and to fall away from honouring <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to be led astray to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and works of art and things made with hands, men of sense could not imprecate anything worse upon themselves than that they might worship just such things, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> them in just such a way; that, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, they might receive in themselves that recompense of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which was meet, <span class="stiki" id="note313932"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse27">Romans&nbsp;1:27</a></span> in the very objects of their worship; not so much honouring them as suffering dishonour by them; abominable because of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and yet more abominable from the vileness of the objects of their adoration and worship; so that they should be even more without understanding than the objects of their worship; being as excessively foolish as the latter are vile.</p>

<p>VII. Well, let these things be the amusement of the children of the Greeks and of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> to whom their folly is due, who turn aside the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of God to themselves, and divide men in various ways in pursuit of shameful thoughts and fancies, ever since they drove us away from the Tree of Life, by means of the Tree of Knowledge unseasonably  and improperly imparted to us, and then assailed us as now weaker than before; carrying clean away the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is the ruling power in us, and opening a door to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For, being of a nature <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> and man-hating, or rather having become so by their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, they could neither endure that we who were below should attain to that which is above, having themselves fallen from above upon the earth; nor that such a change in their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and their first natures should have taken place. This is the meaning of their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the creature. For this God's Image was outraged; and as we did not like to keep the Commandments,  we were given over to the independence of our <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. And as we erred we were disgraced by the objects of our worship. For there was not only this calamity, that we who were made for good works  to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and praise of our Maker, and to imitate God as far as might be, were turned into a den of all sorts of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, which cruelly devour and consume the inner man; but there was this further <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that man actually made gods the advocates of his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, so that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might be reckoned not only irresponsible, but even divine, taking refuge in the objects of his worship as his apology.</p>

<p>VIII. But since to us <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has been given to flee from superstitious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and to be joined to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and to serve the living and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to rise above creation, passing by all that is subject to time and to first motion; let us look at and reason upon God and things divine in a manner corresponding to this Grace given us. But let us begin our discussion of them from the most fitting point. And the most fitting is, as Solomon laid down for us; us; The beginning of wisdom, he says, is to get wisdom. <span class="stiki" id="note313936"><a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse7">Proverbs&nbsp;4:7</a></span> And what this is he tells us; the beginning of wisdom is <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.  For we must not begin with <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and leave off with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> (for an unbridled <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> would perhaps push us over a precipice), but we must be grounded and purified and so to say made light by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and thus be raised to the height. For where <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is there is keeping of commandments; and where there is keeping of commandments there is purifying of the flesh, that cloud which covers the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and suffers it not to see the Divine Ray. And where there is purifying there is Illumination; and Illumination is the satisfying of desire to those who long for the greatest things, or the Greatest Thing, or That Which surpasses all greatness.</p>

<p>IX. Wherefore we must purify ourselves first, and then approach this converse with the Pure; unless we would have the same experience as <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note313938"><a href="../bible/exo034.htm#verse30">Exodus&nbsp;34:30</a></span> who could not endure the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the face of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and therefore asked for a veil; <span class="stiki" id="note313939"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:7</a></span> or else would feel and say with Manoah <q>We are undone O wife, we have seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note313940"><a href="../bible/jdg013.htm#verse23">Judges&nbsp;13:23</a></span> although it was God only in his fancy; or like Peter would send Jesus out of the boat, <span class="stiki" id="note313941"><a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;5:8</a></span> as being ourselves unworthy of such a visit; and when I say Peter, I am speaking of the man who walked upon the waves; <span class="stiki" id="note313942"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;14:29</a></span> or like <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> would be stricken in eyes, <span class="stiki" id="note313943"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse3">Acts&nbsp;9:3-8</a></span> as he was before he was cleansed from the guilt of his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, when he conversed with Him Whom he was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a>&mdash; or rather with a short flash of That great Light; or like the Centurion <span class="stiki" id="note313944"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;8:8</a></span> would seek for healing, but would not, through a praiseworthy <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, receive the Healer into his house. Let each one of us also speak so, as long as he is still uncleansed, and is a Centurion still, commanding many in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and serving in the army of C&aelig;sar, the World-ruler of those who are being dragged down; <q>I am not worthy that you should come under my roof.</q> But when he shall have looked upon <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, though he be little of stature like Zaccheus <span class="stiki" id="note313945"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;19:3</a></span> of old, and climb up on the top of the sycamore tree by mortifying his members which are upon the earth, <span class="stiki" id="note313946"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> and having risen above the body of humiliation, then he shall receive the Word, and it shall be said to him, This day is <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> come to this house. <span class="stiki" id="note313947"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;19:9</a></span> Then let him lay hold on the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and bring forth fruit more perfectly, scattering and pouring forth rightly that which as a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> he wrongly gathered.</p>

<p>X. For the same Word is on the one hand terrible through its nature to those who are unworthy, and on the other through its loving kindness can be received by those who are thus prepared, who have driven out the unclean and worldly spirit from their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and have swept and adorned their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by self-examination, and have not left them idle or without employment, so as again to be occupied with greater armament by the seven spirits of wickedness...the same number as are reckoned of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> (for that which is hardest to fight against calls for the sternest efforts)...but besides fleeing from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, practise <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, making Christ entirely, or at any rate to the greatest extent possible, to dwell within them, so that the power of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cannot meet with any empty place to fill it again with himself, and make the last state of that man worse than the first, by the greater energy of his assault, and the greater strength and impregnability of the fortress. But when, having guarded our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with every care, and having appointed goings up in our heart,  and broken up our fallow ground, <span class="stiki" id="note313949"><a href="../bible/jer004.htm#verse3">Jeremiah&nbsp;4:3</a></span> and sown unto righteousness, <span class="stiki" id="note313950"><a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse18">Proverbs&nbsp;11:18</a></span> as David and Solomon and Jeremiah bid us, let us enlighten ourselves with the light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and then let us speak of the Wisdom of God that has been hid in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note313951"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:6</a></span> and enlighten others. Meanwhile let us purify ourselves, and receive the elementary initiation of the Word, that we may do ourselves the utmost good, making ourselves godlike, and receiving the Word at His coming; and not only so, but holding Him fast and showing Him to others.</p>

<p>XI. And now, having purified the theatre by what has been said, let us discourse a little about the Festival, and join in celebrating this Feast with festal and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. And, since the chief point of the Festival is the remembrance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let us call God to mind. For I think that the sound of those who keep Festival <em>There</em>, where is the dwelling of all the Blissful, is nothing else than this, the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and praises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sung by all who are counted worthy of that City. Let none be astonished if what I have to say contains some things that I have said before; for not only will I utter the same words, but I shall speak of the same subjects, trembling both in tongue and mind and thought when I speak of God for you too, that you may share this laudable and blessed feeling. And when I speak of God you must be illumined at once by one flash of light and by three. Three in Individualities or Hypostases, if any prefer so to call them, or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>,  for we will not quarrel about names so long as the syllables amount to the same meaning; but One in respect of the Substance&mdash; that is, the Godhead. For they are divided without division, if I may so say; and they are united in division. For the Godhead is one in three, and the three are one, in whom the Godhead is, or to speak more accurately, Who are the Godhead. Excesses and defects we will omit, neither making the Unity a confusion, nor the division a separation. We would keep equally far from the confusion of Sabellius and from the division of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, which are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> diametrically opposed, yet equal in their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. For what need is there heretically to fuse God together, or to cut Him up into inequality?</p>

<p>XII. For to us there is but One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of Whom are all things, and One Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, by Whom are all things; and One <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in Whom are all things; <span class="stiki" id="note313953"><a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:6</a></span> yet these words, of, by, in, whom, do not denote a difference of nature (for if this were the case, the three prepositions, or the order of the three names would never be altered), but they characterize the personalities of a nature which is one and unconfused. And this is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the fact that They are again collected into one, if you will read&mdash; not carelessly&mdash; this other passage of the same Apostle, <q>Of Him and through Him and to Him are all things; to Him be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> forever, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note313954"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse36">Romans&nbsp;11:36</a></span> The Father is Father, and is Unoriginate, for He is of no one; the Son is Son, and is not unoriginate, for He is of the Father. But if you take the word Origin in a temporal sense, He too is Unoriginate, for He is the Maker of Time, and is not subject to Time. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Spirit, coming forth from the Father indeed, but not after the manner of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, for it is not by Generation but by Procession (since I must coin a word for the sake of clearness ); for neither did the Father cease to be Unbegotten because of His begetting something, nor the Son to be begotten because He is of the Unbegotten (how could that be?), nor is the Spirit changed into Father or Son because He proceeds, or because He is God&mdash; though the ungodly do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it. For Personality is unchangeable; else how could Personality remain, if it were changeable, and could be removed from one to another? But they who make <q>Unbegotten</q> and <q>Begotten</q> natures of equivocal gods would perhaps make <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and Seth differ in nature, since the former was not born of flesh (for he was created), but the latter was born of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>. There is then One God in Three, and These Three are One, as we have said.</p>

<p>XIII. Since then these things are so, or rather since This is so; and His Adoration ought not to be rendered only by Beings above, but there ought to be also worshippers on earth, that all things may be filled with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God (forasmuch as they are filled with God Himself); therefore man was created and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with the hand  and Image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But to despise man, when by the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> and the bitter taste of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> he was pitiably severed from God his Maker&mdash; this was not in the Nature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What then was done, and what is the great Mystery that concerns us? An innovation is made upon nature, and God is made Man. <q>He that rides upon the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> of Heavens in the East</q>  of His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and Majesty, is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the West of our meanness and lowliness. And the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> deigns to become and to be called <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>; not changing what He was (for It is unchangeable); but assuming what He was not (for He is full of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to man), that the Incomprehensible  might be comprehended, conversing with us through the mediation of the Flesh as through a veil; since it was not possible for that nature which is subject to birth and decay to endure His unveiled Godhead. Therefore the Unmingled is mingled; and not only is God mingled with birth and Spirit  with flesh, and the Eternal with time, and the Uncircumscribed with measure; but also Generation with Virginity, and dishonour with Him who is higher than all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; He who is impassible with Suffering,  and the Immortal with the corruptible. For since that <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Deceiver</a> thought that he was unconquerable in his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, after he had cheated us with the hope of becoming gods, he was himself cheated by God's assumption of our nature; so that in attacking <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> as he thought, he should really meet with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thus the new <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> should save the old, and the condemnation of the flesh should be abolished, death being slain by flesh.</p>

<p>XIV. At His birth we duly kept Festival, both I, the leader of the Feast, and you, and all that is in the world and above the world. With the Star we ran, and with the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> we worshipped, and with the Shepherds we were illuminated, and with the Angels we <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him, and with Simeon we took Him up in our arms, and with Anna the aged and chaste we made our responsive confession. And thanks be to Him who came to His own in the guise of a stranger, because He <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the stranger.  Now, we come to another action of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and another <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. I cannot restrain my pleasure; I am rapt into God. Almost like John I proclaim good tidings; for though I be not a Forerunner, yet am I from the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.  Christ is illumined, let us shine forth with Him. Christ is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, let us descend with Him that we may also ascend with Him. Jesus is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; but we must attentively consider not only this but also some other points. Who is He, and by whom is He <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and at what time? He is the All-pure; and He is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John; and the time is the beginning of His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. What are we to learn and to be taught by this? To purify ourselves first; to be lowly minded; and to preach only in maturity both of spiritual and bodily stature. The first  has a word especially for those who rush to Baptism off hand, and without due preparation, or providing for the stability of the Baptismal Grace by the disposition of their minds to good. For since Grace contains remission of the past (for it is a <em><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></em>), it is on that account more worthy of reverence, that we return not to the same vomit again. The second speaks to those who rebel against the Stewards of this Mystery, if they are their superiors in rank. The third is for those who are confident in their youth, and think that any time is the right one to teach or to preside. Jesus is purified, and do you despise purification?...and by John, and do you rise up against your herald?...and at thirty years of age, and do you before your beard has grown presume to teach the aged, or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you teach them, though thou be not reverend on account of your age, or even perhaps for your character? But here it may be said, Daniel, and this or that other, were judges in their youth, and examples are on your tongues; for every wrongdoer is prepared to defend himself. But I reply that that which is rare is not the law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For one swallow does not make a summer, nor one line a geometrician, nor one voyage a sailor.</p>

<p>XV. But John baptizes, Jesus comes to Him <span class="stiki" id="note313964"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;3:14</a></span> ...perhaps to sanctify the Baptist himself, but certainly to bury the whole of the old <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> in the water; and before this and for the sake of this, to sanctify Jordan; for as He is Spirit and Flesh, so He consecrates us by Spirit and water. <span class="stiki" id="note313965"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;5:35</a></span> John will not receive Him; Jesus contends. <q>I have need to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by You</q> <span class="stiki" id="note313966"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;3:17</a></span> says the Voice to the Word, the Friend to the Bridegroom; <span class="stiki" id="note313967"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;3:39</a></span> he that is above all among them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note313968"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;11:11</a></span> to Him Who is the Firstborn of every creature; <span class="stiki" id="note313969"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse5">Colossians&nbsp;1:5</a></span> he that leaped in the womb, <span class="stiki" id="note313970"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;1:41</a></span> to Him Who was adored in the womb; he who was and is to be the Forerunner  to Him Who was and is to be manifested. <q>I have need to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by You;</q> add to this <q>and for You;</q> for he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he would be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Martyrdom, or, like Peter, that he would be cleansed not only as to his feet. <span class="stiki" id="note313972"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;13:9</a></span> <q>And You come to me?</q> This also was prophetic; for he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that after <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> would come the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and so that when he had gone before Christ would follow him. But what says Jesus? <q>Allow it to be so now,</q> for this is the time of His Incarnation; for He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that yet a little while and He should <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the Baptist. And what is the <q>Fan?</q> The Purification. And what is the <q>Fire?</q> The consuming of the chaff, and the heat of the Spirit. And what the <q>Axe?</q> The excision of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is incurable even after the dung. <span class="stiki" id="note313973"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;13:8</a></span> And what the Sword? The cutting of the Word, which separates the worse from the better, <span class="stiki" id="note313974"><a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse12">Hebrews&nbsp;4:12</a></span> and makes a division between the faithful and the unbeliever; <span class="stiki" id="note313975"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse35">Matthew&nbsp;10:35</a></span> and stirs up the son and the daughter and the bride against the father and the mother and the mother in law, <span class="stiki" id="note313976"><a href="../bible/mic007.htm#verse6">Micah&nbsp;7:6</a></span> the young and fresh against the old and shadowy. And what is the Latchet of the shoe, which thou John who baptizest Jesus may not loose? <span class="stiki" id="note313977"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;1:27</a></span> thou who art of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and hast no food, the new Elias, <span class="stiki" id="note313978"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;7:26</a></span> the more than Prophet, inasmuch as you saw Him of Whom you prophesied, thou Mediator of the Old and New Testaments. What is this? Perhaps the Message of the Advent, and the Incarnation, of which not the least point may be loosed, I say not by those  who are yet carnal and babes in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but not even by those who are like John in spirit.</p>

<p>XVI. But further&mdash; Jesus goes up out of the water...for with Himself He carries up the world...and sees the heaven opened which <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had shut against himself and all his posterity, <span class="stiki" id="note313980"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;3:24</a></span> as the gates of Paradise by the flaming sword. And the Spirit bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to His Godhead, for he descends upon One that is like Him, as does the Voice from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> (for He to Whom the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is borne came from thence), and like a Dove, for He honours the Body (for this also was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through its union with God) by being seen in a bodily form; and moreover, the Dove has from distant ages been wont to proclaim the end of the Deluge.  But if you are to judge of Godhead by bulk and weight, and the Spirit seems to you a small thing because He came in the form of a Dove, O man of contemptible littleness of thought concerning the greatest of things, you must also to be consistent despise the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, because it is compared to a grain of mustard seed; <span class="stiki" id="note313982"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;13:31</a></span> and you must exalt the adversary above the Majesty of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, because he is called a great Mountain, <span class="stiki" id="note313983"><a href="../bible/zec004.htm#verse7">Zechariah&nbsp;4:7</a></span> and Leviathan  and King of that which lives in the water, whereas Christ is called the Lamb, <span class="stiki" id="note313985"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;53:7</a></span> and the Pearl, <span class="stiki" id="note313986"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;13:46</a></span> and the Drop  and similar names.</p>

<p>XVII. Now, since our Festival is of Baptism, and we must endure a little hardness with Him Who for our sake took form, and was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and was crucified; let us speak about the different kinds of Baptism, that we may come out thence purified. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <span class="stiki" id="note313988"><a href="../bible/lev011.htm">Leviticus&nbsp;xi</a></span> but it was in water, and before that in the cloud and in the sea. <span class="stiki" id="note313989"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:2</a></span> This was typical as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says; the Sea of the water, and the Cloud of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; the Manna, of the Bread of Life; the Drink, of the Divine Drink. John also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; but this was not like the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, for it was not only in water, but also <q>unto repentance.</q> Still it was not wholly spiritual, for he does not add <q>And in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.</q> Jesus also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>. This is the perfect Baptism. And how is He not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if I may digress a little, by whom you too are made God? I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also a Fourth Baptism&mdash; that by Martyrdom and blood, which also Christ himself underwent:&mdash; and this one is far more august than all the others, inasmuch as it cannot be defiled by after-stains. Yes, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of a Fifth also, which is that of tears, and is much more laborious, received by him who washes his bed every night and his couch with tears;  whose bruises stink through his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>;  and who goes mourning and of a sad countenance; who imitates the repentance of Manasseh <span class="stiki" id="note313992"><!--k28--<a href="../bible/2ch038.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;38:12</a></span> and the humiliation of the Ninevites <span class="stiki" id="note313993"><a href="../bible/jon003.htm#verse7">Jonah&nbsp;3:7-10</a></span> upon which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had mercy; who utters the words of the Publican in the Temple, and is justified rather than the stiff-necked <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note313994"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;18:13</a></span> who like the Canaanite <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> bends down and asks for mercy and crumbs, the food of a dog that is very hungry. <span class="stiki" id="note313995"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;15:27</a></span> </p>

<p>XVIII. I, however, for I confess myself to be a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>&mdash;that is to say, an animal shifty and of a changeable nature,&mdash; both eagerly receive this Baptism, and worship Him Who has given it me, and impart it to others; and by showing mercy make provision for mercy. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I too am compassed with infirmity, <span class="stiki" id="note313996"><a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse2">Hebrews&nbsp;5:2</a></span> and that with what measure I mete it shall be measured to me again. <span class="stiki" id="note313997"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;7:2</a></span> But what do you say, O new <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> pure  in title but not in intention, who dischargest upon us the sentiments of Novatus,  though you share the same infirmities? Will you not give any place to weeping? Will you shed no tear? May you not meet with a Judge like yourself? Are you not ashamed by the mercy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Who took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses; <span class="stiki" id="note314000"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;8:17</a></span> Who came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance;  Who will have mercy rather than <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>; who forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> till seventy times seven.  How blessed would your exaltation be if it really were purity, not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, making <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> above the reach of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and destroying improvement by despair. For both are alike <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, indulgence not regulated by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and condemnation that will never forgive; the one because it relaxes all reins, the other because it strangles by its severity. Show me your purity, and I will approve your boldness. But as it is, I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that being full of sores you will render them incurable. Will you not admit even David's repentance, to whom his penitence preserved even the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>? Nor the great Peter himself, who fell into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness at the Passion of our Saviour? Yet Jesus received him, and by the threefold question and confession healed the threefold denial.  Or will you even refuse to admit that he was made perfect by blood (for your folly goes even as far as that)? Or the transgressor at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>? But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> confirmed <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards him when he saw his amendment, and gives the reason, <q>that such an one be not swallowed up by overmuch sorrow,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note314004"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> being overwhelmed by the excess of the punishment.  And will you refuse to grant liberty of marriage to young <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> on account of the liability of their age to fall? <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> ventured to do so; but of course you can teach him; for you have been caught up to the Fourth heaven, and to another Paradise, and have heard words more unspeakable, and comprehend a larger circle in your <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<p>XIX. But these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were not after Baptism, you will say. Where is your <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>? Either prove it&mdash; or refrain from condemning; and if there be any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, let charity prevail. But Novatus, you say, would not receive those who lapsed in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. What do you mean by this? If they were unrepentant he was right; I too would refuse to receive those who either would not stoop at all or not sufficiently, and who would refuse to make their amendment counterbalance their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and when I do receive them, I will assign them their proper place;  but if he refused those who wore themselves away with weeping, I will not imitate him. And why should Novatus's want of charity be a rule for me? He never punished <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which is a second <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; but he condemned fornication as though he himself were not flesh and body. What say you? Are we convincing you by these words? Come and stand here on our side, that is, on the side of humanity. Let us magnify the Lord together. Let none of you, even though he has much confidence in himself, dare to say, Touch me not for I am pure, and who is so pure as I? Give us too a share in your brightness. But perhaps we are not convincing you? Then we will weep for you. Let these men then if they will, follow our way, which is Christ's way; but if they will not, let them go their own. Perhaps in it they will be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with Fire, in that last Baptism which is more painful and longer, which devours wood like grass, <span class="stiki" id="note314007"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:12-19</a></span> and consumes the stubble of every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p>XX. But let us venerate today the Baptism of Christ; and let us keep the feast well, not in pampering the belly, but rejoicing in spirit. And how shall we luxuriate? <q>Wash you, make you clean.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note314008"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse17">Isaiah&nbsp;1:17-18</a></span> If you be scarlet with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and less bloody, be made white as snow; if you be red, and men bathed in blood, yet be ye brought to the whiteness of wool.
