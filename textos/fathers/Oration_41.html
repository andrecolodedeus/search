<h1>Oration 41</h1>

<p><strong>On Pentecost.</strong></p>

<p> <em>It</em> <em>is uncertain to what year the following Oration belongs. It was, however, certainly delivered at Constantinople; the Benedictine Editors think in the year 381, in which case the day would be May 16. An indication tending to establish this date is found in c. 14, in the expression of apprehension of personal danger to himself for his boldness in setting forth the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In fact, in the earlier part of this year, after the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> had put him in possession of the Patriarchal Throne, vacant by the expulsion and deposition of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> Demophilus, he had narrowly escaped assassination at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>.</em></p>

<p>The Oration deals again with the subject of the Fifth Theological Oration, the question of the Deity of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but proceeds to establish the point by quite a different set of arguments from those adopted in the former discourse, none of whose points are here repeated.</p>

<p>The Preacher begins by commenting on the various ways in which Festivals are kept by <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, by Heathen and by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Then he remarked on the mystical significance of the number Seven, which he illustrates by several instances; and next proceeds with his principal Subject.</p>

<p>God the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he says, completes the work of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Those who regard Him as a Created Being, as did the followers of Macedonius, are thereby guilty of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and impiety. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith recognizes Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this belief is necessary to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; yet some reserve must be employed in applying that Name to Him. We must indeed insist on the recognition of His possession of all the attributes of Godhead; and we must at any rate bear with those who, like the Orator himself, also give Him the Name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which he hopes all his hearers will receive from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to do. Then he proceeds to show from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> that in fact all the Attributes of Deity do belong to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and that His distinctive Personal Mark is that He is neither Unbegotten like the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor Begotten like the Son. He does not touch on the question of the double Procession.</p>

<p>It would seem from some expressions in c. 8 that this Discourse was not delivered to his usual audience, but to an Assembly of <q>Religious.</q></p>

<p>The Title of the Oration varies in different mss. Thus some have it <q>Of The Same On Pentecost,</q> to which one adds <q>And On The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>;</q> and another puts it <q>Of The Same, a Homily on Pentecost.</q> The printed Editions before the Benedictine have <q>On The Holy Pentecost.</q></p>

<p>I. Let us reason a little about the Festival, that we may keep it spiritually. For different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have different ways of keeping Festival; but to the worshipper of the Word a discourse seems best; and of discourses, that which is best adapted to the occasion. And of all beautiful things none gives so much <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to the lover of the beautiful, as that the lover of festivals should keep them spiritually. Let us look into the matter thus. The Jew keeps festival as well as we, but only in the letter. For while following after the bodily Law, he has not attained to the spiritual Law. The Greek too keeps festival, but only in the body, and in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of his own gods and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, some of whom are creators of passion by their own admission, and others were honoured out of passion. Therefore even their manner of keeping festival is passionate, as though their very <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> were an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Whom their passion takes refuge as a thing to be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of.  We too keep festival, but we keep it as is pleasing to the Spirit. And it is pleasing to Him that we should keep it by discharging some duty, either of action or speech. This then is our manner of keeping festival, to treasure up in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> some of those things which are permanent and will cleave to it, not of those which will forsake us and be destroyed, and which only tickle our senses for a little while; whereas they are for the most part, in my judgment at least, harmful and ruinous. For sufficient unto the body is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thereof. What need has that fire of further fuel, or that beast of more plentiful food, to make it more uncontrollable, and too violent for reason?</p>

<p>II. Wherefore we must keep the feast spiritually. And this is the beginning of our discourse; for we must speak, even if our speech do seem a little too discursive; and we must be diligent for the sake of those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> learning, that we may as it were mix up some seasoning with our solemn festival. The children of the Hebrews do <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the number Seven, according to the legislation of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> (as did the Pythagoreans in later days to the number Four, by which indeed they were in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of swearing  as the <a href="../cathen/13797a.htm">Simonians</a> and Marcionites  do by the number Eight and the number Thirty, inasmuch as they have given names to and reverence a system of <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> of these numbers); I cannot say by what rules of analogy, or in consequence of what power of this number; anyhow they do <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to it. One thing indeed is evident, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having in six days created matter, and given it form, and having arranged it in all kinds of shapes and mixtures, and having made this present visible world, on the seventh day rested from all His works, as is shown by the very name of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, which in Hebrew means Rest. If there be, however, any more lofty reason than this, let others discuss it. But this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which they pay to it is not confined to days alone, but also extends to years. That belonging to days the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> proves, because it is continually observed among them; and in accordance with this the removal of leaven is for that number of days. <span class="stiki" id="note314208"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse15">Exodus&nbsp;12:15</a></span> And that belonging to years is shown by the seventh year, the year of Release;  and it consists not only of Hebdomads, but of Hebdomads of Hebdomads, alike in days and years. The Hebdomads of days give birth to Pentecost, a day called <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> among them; and those of years to what they call the Jubilee, which also has a release of land, and a manumission of slaves, and a release of possessions bought. For this nation consecrates to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not only the firstfruits of offspring, or of <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>, but also those of days and years. Thus the veneration paid to the number Seven gave rise also to the veneration of Pentecost. For seven being multiplied by seven generates fifty all but one day, which we borrow from the world to come, at once the Eighth and the first, or rather one and indestructible. For the present sabbatism of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> can find its cessation there, that a portion may be given to seven and also to eight  (so some of our predecessors have interpreted this passage of Solomon).</p>

<p>III. As to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> paid to Seven there are many testimonies, but we will be content with a few out of the many. For instance, seven precious spirits are named; for I think Isaiah <span class="stiki" id="note314211"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;11:2</a></span> loves to call the activities of the Spirit spirits; and the Oracles of the Lord are purified seven times according to David,  and the just is delivered from six troubles and in the seventh is not smitten. <span class="stiki" id="note314213"><a href="../bible/job005.htm#verse19">Job&nbsp;5:19</a></span> But the sinner is pardoned not seven times, but seventy times seven. <span class="stiki" id="note314214"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;18:22</a></span> And we may see it by the contrary also (for the punishment of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is to be praised), Cain being avenged seven times, that is, punishment being exacted from him for his fratricide, and Lamech seventy times seven, <span class="stiki" id="note314215"><a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;4:24</a></span> because he was a murderer after the law and the condemnation.  And <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> neighbours receive sevenfold into their bosom;  and the House of Wisdom rests on seven pillars <span class="stiki" id="note314218"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm">Proverbs&nbsp;9:i</a></span> and the Stone of Zerubbabel is adorned with seven eyes; <span class="stiki" id="note314219"><a href="../bible/zec003.htm#verse9">Zechariah&nbsp;3:9</a></span> and God is praised seven times a day.  And again the barren bears seven, <span class="stiki" id="note314221"><a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;2:5</a></span> the perfect number, she who is contrasted with her who is imperfect in her children. </p>

<p>IV. And if we must also look at ancient history, I perceive that <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314223"><a href="../bible/jud001.htm#verse14">Jude&nbsp;14</a></span> the seventh among our ancestors, was honoured by translation. I perceive also that the twenty-first, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314224"><a href="../bible/gen005.htm#verse22">Genesis&nbsp;5:22</a></span> was given the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Patriarchate, by the addition of a greater <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. For the Hebdomad thrice repeated brings out this number. And one who is very bold might venture even to come to the New Adam, my God and Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Who is counted the Seventy-seventh from the old <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> who fell under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in the backward genealogy according to Luke. <span class="stiki" id="note314225"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;3:34</a></span> And I think of the seven trumpets of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the son of Nave, and the same number of circuits and days and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, by which the walls of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> were shaken down.  And so too the seven compassings of the City; in the same way as there is a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> in the threefold breathings of Elias, the Prophet, by which he breathed life into the son of the Sareptan <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314227"><a href="../bible/1ki017.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;17:21</a></span> and the same number of his floodings of the wood,  when he consumed the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> with fire sent from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and condemned the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of shame who could not do the like at his challenge. And the sevenfold looking for the cloud imposed upon the young servant; and Eliss&aelig;us stretching himself that number of times upon the child of the Shunammite, by which stretching the breath of life was restored.  To the same doctrine belongs, I think (if I may omit the seven-stemmed and seven-lamped candlestick of the Temple ) that the ceremony of the Priests' consecration lasted seven days; <span class="stiki" id="note314231"><a href="../bible/lev008.htm#verse33">Leviticus&nbsp;8:33</a></span> and seven that of the purifying of a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>,  and that of the Dedication of the Temple <span class="stiki" id="note314233"><a href="../bible/1ki008.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;8:6</a></span> the same number, and that in the seventieth year the people returned from the Captivity; <span class="stiki" id="note314234"><a href="../bible/2ch036.htm#verse32">2&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;36:32</a></span> that whatever is in Units may appear also in Decads, and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Hebdomad be reverenced in a more perfect number. But why do I speak of the distant past? Jesus Himself who is pure perfection, could in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> and with five loaves feed five thousand, and again with seven loaves four thousand. And the leavings after they were satisfied were in the first case twelve baskets full, and in the other seven baskets;  neither, I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, without a reason or unworthy of the Spirit. And if you read for yourself you may take note of many numbers which contain a meaning deeper than appears on the surface. But to come to an instance which is most useful to us on the present occasion, not that for these reasons or others very similar or yet more divine, the Hebrews <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Day of Pentecost, and we also <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> it; just as there are other <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of the Hebrews which we observe...they were typically observed by them, and by us they are sacramentally reinstated. And now having said so much by way of preface about the Day, let us proceed to what we have to say further.</p>

<p>V. We are keeping the feast of Pentecost and of the Coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and the appointed time of the Promise, and the fulfilment of our hope. And how great, how august, is the Mystery. The dispensations of the Body of Christ are ended; or rather, what belongs to His Bodily Advent (for I hesitate to say the Dispensation of His Body, as long as no discourse persuades me that it is better to have put off the body ), and that of the Spirit is beginning. And what were the things pertaining to the Christ? The Virgin, the Birth, the Manger, the Swaddling, the Angels glorifying Him, the Shepherds running to Him, the course of the Star, the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> worshipping Him and bringing Gifts, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of the children, the Flight of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the Return from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the Circumcision, the Baptism, the Witness from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, the Temptation, the Stoning for our sake (because He had to be given as an Example to us of enduring affliction for the Word), the Betrayal, the Nailing, the Burial, the Resurrection, the Ascension; and of these even now He suffers many dishonours at the hands of the enemies of Christ; and He bears them, for He is longsuffering. But from those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him He receives all that is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>. And He defers, as in the former case His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, so in ours His kindness; in their case perhaps to give them the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of repentance, and in ours to test our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; whether we do not faint in our tribulations <span class="stiki" id="note314237"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;3:13</a></span> and conflicts for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Religion, as was from of old the order of His Divine Economy, and of his unsearchable judgments, with which He orders wisely all that concerns us. Such are the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And what follows we shall see to be more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>; and may we too be seen. As to the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, may the Spirit be with me, and grant me speech as much as I desire; or if not that, yet as is in due proportion to the season. Anyhow He will be with me as my Lord; not in servile guise, nor awaiting a command, as some think.  For He blows where He wills and on whom He wills, and to what extent He wills. <span class="stiki" id="note314239"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse8">John&nbsp;3:8</a></span> Thus we are inspired both to think and to speak of the Spirit.</p>

<p>VI. They who reduce the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to the rank of a creature are <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> servants, and worst of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. For it is the part of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> servants to despise Lordship, and to rebel against dominion, and to make That which is free their fellow-servant. But they who deem Him God are inspired by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>  and are illustrious in their mind; and they who go further and <em>call</em> Him so, if to well disposed hearers are exalted; if to the low, are not reserved enough, for they commit pearls to clay, and the noise of thunder to weak ears, and the sun to feeble eyes, and solid food to those who are still using milk; <span class="stiki" id="note314241"><a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse12">Hebrews&nbsp;5:12</a></span> whereas they ought to lead them little by little up to what lies beyond them, and to bring them up to the higher <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; adding light to light, and supplying <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> upon <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore we will leave the more mature discourse, for which the time has not yet come, and will speak with them as follows.</p>

<p>VII. If, my friends, you will not acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to be uncreated, nor yet <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; clearly such a state of mind is due to the contrary spirit&mdash; forgive me, if in my <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> I speak somewhat over boldly. If, however, you are sound enough to escape this evident impiety, and to place outside of slavery Him Who gives freedom to yourselves, then see for yourselves with the help of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and of us what follows. For I am persuaded that you are to some extent partakers of Him, so that I will go into the question with you as kindred <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Either show me some mean between lordship and servitude, that I may there place the rank of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; or, if you shrink from imputing servitude to Him, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of the rank in which you must place the object of your search. But you are dissatisfied with the syllables, and you stumble at the word, and it is to you a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense;  for so is Christ to some minds. It is only <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> after all. Let us meet one another in a spiritual manner; let us be full rather of brotherly than of self <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Grant us the Power of the Godhead, and we will give up to you the use of the Name. Confess the Nature in other words for which you have greater reverence, and we will heal you as infirm people, filching from you some matters in which you delight. For it is shameful, yes, shameful and utterly illogical, when you are sound in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to draw petty distinctions about the sound, and to hide the Treasure, as if you envied it to others, or were afraid lest you should sanctify your own tongue too. But it is even more shameful for us to be in the state of which we accuse you, and, while condemning your petty distinctions of words to make petty distinctions of letters.</p>

<p>VIII. Confess, my friends, the Trinity to be of One Godhead; or if you will, of One Nature; and we will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the Spirit to give you this word God. He will give it to you, I well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, inasmuch as He has already granted you the first portion and the second;  and especially if that about which we are contending is some spiritual cowardice, and not the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> objection. Yet more clearly and concisely, let me say, do not you call us to account for our loftier word (for <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> has nothing to do with this ascent), and we will not find fault with what you have been able to attain, until by another road you are brought up to the same resting place. For we are not seeking victory, but to gain brethren, by whose separation from us we are torn. This we concede to you in whom we do find something of vital <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, who are sound as to the Son. We admire your life, but we do not altogether approve your doctrine. You who have the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, receive Himself in addition, that you may not only strive, but strive lawfully, <span class="stiki" id="note314244"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> which is the condition of your crown. May this reward of your conversation be granted you, that you may confess the Spirit perfectly and proclaim with us, aye and before us, all that is His due. Yes, and I will venture even more on your behalf; I will even utter the Apostle's wish. So much do I cling to you, and so much do I revere your array, and the colour of your continence, and those sacred assemblies, and the august Virginity, and purification, and the Psalmody that lasts all night  and your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and of the brethren, and of strangers, that I could consent to be Anathema from Christ, and even to suffer something as one condemned, if only you might stand beside us, and we might glorify the Trinity together. For of the others why should I speak, seeing they are clearly dead (and it is the part of Christ alone to raise them, Who quickens the dead by His own Power), and are unhappily separated in place as they are bound together by their doctrine; and who quarrel among themselves as much as a pair of squinting eyes in looking at the same object, and differ with one another, not in sight but in position&mdash; if indeed we may charge them only with squinting, and not with utter blindness. And now that I have to some extent laid down your position, come, let us return again to the subject of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and I think you will follow me now.</p>

<p>IX. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, then, always <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, and exists, and always will exist. He neither had a beginning, nor will He have an end; but He was everlastingly ranged with and numbered with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. For it was not ever fitting that either the Son should be wanting to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the Spirit to the Son. For then Deity would be shorn of Its Glory in its greatest respect, for It would seem to have arrived at the consummation of perfection as if by an afterthought. Therefore He was ever being partaken, but not partaking; perfecting, not being perfected; sanctifying, not being sanctified; deifying, not being deified; Himself ever the same with Himself, and with Those with Whom He is ranged; invisible, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, incomprehensible, unchangeable, without quality, without quantity, without <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, impalpable, self-moving, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> moving, with <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, self-powerful, All-powerful (even though all that is of the Spirit is referable to the First Cause, just as is all that is of the Only-begotten); Life and Lifegiver; Light and Lightgiver; absolute Good, and Spring of Goodness; the Right, the Princely Spirit; the Lord, the Sender, the Separator; Builder of His own Temple; leading, working as He wills; distributing His own Gifts; the Spirit of Adoption, of Truth, of Wisdom, of Understanding, of Knowledge, of Godliness, of Counsel, of Fear (which are ascribed to Him ) by Whom the Father is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and the Son is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>; and by Whom <em>alone</em> He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; one class, one service, worship, power, perfection, sanctification. Why make a long discourse of it? All that the Father has the Son has also, except the being Unbegotten; and all that the Son has the Spirit has also, except the Generation. And these two matters do not divide the Substance, as I understand it, but rather are divisions within the Substance. </p>

<p>X. Are you labouring to bring forth objections? Well, so am I to get on with my discourse. Honour the Day of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; restrain your tongue if you can a little. It is the time to speak of other tongues&mdash; reverence them or <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> them, when you see that they are of fire. Today let us teach dogmatically; tomorrow we may discuss. Today let us keep the feast; tomorrow will be time enough to behave ourselves unseemly&mdash; the first <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a>, the second theatrically; the one in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, the other in the marketplace; the one among the sober, the other among the drunken; the one as befits those who vehemently desire, the other, as among those who make a joke of the Spirit. Having then put an end to the element that is foreign to us, let us now thoroughly furnish our own friends.</p>

<p>XI. He wrought first in the heavenly and angelic powers, and such as are first after God and around God. For from no other source flows their perfection and their brightness, and the difficulty or impossibility of moving them to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And next, in the Patriarchs and Prophets, of whom the former saw Visions of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him, and the latter also foreknew the future, having their master part moulded by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and being associated with events that were yet future as if present, for such is the power of the Spirit. And next in the Disciples of Christ (for I omit to mention Christ Himself, in Whom He dwelt, not as energizing, but as accompanying His Equal), and that in three ways, as they were able to receive Him, and on three occasions; before Christ was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the Passion, and after He was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the Resurrection; and after His Ascension, or Restoration, or whatever we ought to call it, to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. Now the first of these manifests Him&mdash; the healing of the sick and casting out of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, which could not be apart from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; and so does that breathing upon them after the Resurrection, which was clearly a divine inspiration; and so too the present distribution of the fiery tongues, which we are now commemorating. But the first manifested Him indistinctly, the second more expressly, this present one more perfectly, since He is no longer present only in energy, but as we may say, substantially, associating with us, and dwelling in us. For it was fitting that as the Son had lived with us in bodily form&mdash; so the Spirit too should appear in bodily form; and that after Christ had returned to His own place, He should have come down to us&mdash; <em>Coming</em> because He is the Lord; <em>Sent</em>, because He is not a rival God. For such words no less manifest the Unanimity than they mark the separate Individuality.</p>

<p>XII. And therefore He came after Christ, that a Comforter should not be lacking unto us; but <em>Another</em> Comforter, that you might acknowledge His co-equality. For this word Another marks an Alter Ego, a name of equal Lordship, not of inequality. For Another is not said, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, of different kinds, but of things consubstantial. And He came in the form of Tongues because of His close relation to the Word. And they were of Fire, perhaps because of His purifying Power (for our Scripture <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of a purifying fire, as any one who wishes can find out), or else because of His Substance. For our God is a consuming Fire, and a Fire <span class="stiki" id="note314248"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse20">Hebrews&nbsp;12:20</a></span> burning up the ungodly; <span class="stiki" id="note314249"><a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse24">Deuteronomy&nbsp;4:24</a></span> though you may again pick a quarrel over these words, being brought into difficulty by the Consubstantiality. And the tongues were cloven, because of the diversity of Gifts; and they sat to signify His Royalty and Rest among the Saints, and because the Cherubim are the Throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And it took place in an Upper Chamber (I hope I am not seeming to any one over tedious), because those who should receive it were to ascend and be raised above the earth; for also certain upper chambers  are covered with Divine Waters,  by which the praise of God are sung. And Jesus Himself in an Upper Chamber gave the Communion of the Sacrament to those who were being initiated into the higher Mysteries, that thereby might be shown on the one hand that God must come down to us, as I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> He did of old to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; and on the other that we must go up to Him, and that so there should come to pass a Communion of God with men, by a coalescing of the dignity. For as long as either remains on its own footing, the One in His Glory  the other in his lowliness, so long the Goodness of God cannot mingle with us, and His lovingkindness is incommunicable, and there is a great gulf between, which cannot be crossed; and which separates not only the Rich Man from Lazarus and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> Bosom which he longs for, but also the created and changing natures from that which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and immutable.</p>

<p>XIII. This was proclaimed by the Prophets in such passages as the following:&mdash; The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is upon me; <span class="stiki" id="note314253"><a href="../bible/isa061.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;61:1</a></span> and, There shall rest upon Him Seven Spirits; and The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> descended and led them;  and The spirit of Knowledge filling Bezaleel, <span class="stiki" id="note314255"><a href="../bible/exo031.htm#verse3">Exodus&nbsp;31:3</a></span> the Master-builder of the Tabernacle; and, The Spirit provoking to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note314256"><a href="../bible/isa063.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;63:10</a></span> and the Spirit carrying away Elias in a chariot, <span class="stiki" id="note314257"><a href="../bible/2ki002.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;2:11</a></span> and sought in double measure by Eliss&aelig;us; and David led and strengthened by the Good and Princely Spirit.  And He was promised by the mouth of Joel first, who said, And it shall be in the last days that I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh (that is, upon all that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>), and upon your sons and upon your daughters, <span class="stiki" id="note314259"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse28">Joel&nbsp;2:28</a></span> and the rest; and then afterwards by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, being <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by Him, and giving back <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to Him, as He was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the Father. <span class="stiki" id="note314260"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;14:16</a></span> And how abundant was this Promise. He shall abide for ever, and shall remain with you, whether now with those who in the sphere of time are worthy, or hereafter with those who are counted worthy of that world, when we have kept Him altogether by our life here, and not rejected Him in so far as we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>XIV. This Spirit shares with the Son in working both the Creation and the Resurrection, as you may be shown by this Scripture; By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the power of them by the breath of His Mouth;  and this, The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> that made me, and the Breath of the Almighty that teaches me; <span class="stiki" id="note314262"><a href="../bible/job033.htm#verse4">Job&nbsp;33:4</a></span> and again, You shall send forth Your Spirit and they shall be created, and You shall renew the face of the earth.  And He is the Author of spiritual regeneration. Here is your <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>:&mdash; None can see or enter into the Kingdom, except he be born again of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314264"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;3:3</a></span> and be cleansed from the first birth, which is a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the night, by a remoulding of the day and of the Light, by which every one singly is created anew. This Spirit, for He is most wise and most loving, <span class="stiki" id="note314265"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse6">Wisdom&nbsp;1:6</a></span> if He takes possession of a shepherd makes him a Psalmist, subduing <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> by his song, <span class="stiki" id="note314266"><a href="../bible/1sa016.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;16:23</a></span> and proclaims him King; if he possess a goatherd and scraper  of sycamore fruit, <span class="stiki" id="note314268"><a href="../bible/amo007.htm#verse14">Amos&nbsp;7:14</a></span> He makes him a Prophet. Call to mind David and Amos. If He possess a goodly youth, He makes him a Judge of Elders,  even beyond his years, as Daniel testifies, who conquered the lions in their den. <span class="stiki" id="note314270"><a href="../bible/dan006.htm#verse22">Daniel&nbsp;6:22</a></span> If He takes possession of Fishermen, He makes them catch the whole world in the nets of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, taking them up in the meshes of the Word. Look at Peter and Andrew and the Sons of Thunder, thundering the things of the Spirit. If of Publicans, He makes gain of them for discipleship, and makes them merchants of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> Matthew, yesterday a Publican, today an Evangelist. If of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> persecutors, He changes the current of their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and makes them Pauls instead of Sauls, and as full of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> as He found them of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. And He is the Spirit of Meekness, and yet is provoked by those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Let us therefore make <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of Him as gentle, not as wrathful, by confessing His Dignity; and let us not desire to see Him implacably wrathful. He too it is who has made me today a bold herald to you&mdash;if without rest to myself, God be thanked; but if with risk, thanks to Him nevertheless; in the one case, that He may spare those that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us; in the other, that He may consecrate us, in receiving this reward of our preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, to be made perfect by blood.</p>

<p>XV. They spoke with strange tongues, and not those of their native land; and the wonder was great, a language spoken by those who had not learned it. And the sign is to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, <span class="stiki" id="note314271"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:22</a></span> and not to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that it may be an accusation of the unbelievers, as it is written, With other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people, and not even so will they listen to Me <span class="stiki" id="note314272"><a href="../bible/isa028.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;28:11</a></span> says the Lord. But they heard. Here stop a little and raise a question, how you are to divide the words. For the expression has an ambiguity, which is to be determined by the punctuation. Did they each hear in their own dialect  so that if I may so say, one sound was uttered, but many were heard; the air being thus beaten and, so to speak, sounds being produced more clear than the original sound; or are we to put the stop after <q>they Heard,</q> and then to add <q>them speaking in their own languages</q> to what follows, so that it would be speaking in languages their own to the hearers, which would be foreign to the speakers? I prefer to put it this latter way; for on the other plan the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> would be rather of the hearers than of the speakers; whereas in this it would be on the speakers' side; and it was they who were reproached for <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, evidently because they by the Spirit wrought a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> in the matter of the tongues.</p>

<p>XVI. But as the old Confusion of tongues was laudable, when men who were of one language in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and impiety, even as some now venture to be, were building the Tower; <span class="stiki" id="note314274"><a href="../bible/gen011.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;11:7</a></span> for by the confusion of their language the unity of their intention was broken up, and their undertaking destroyed; so much more worthy of praise is the present miraculous one. For being poured from One Spirit upon many men, it brings them again into harmony. And there is a diversity of Gifts, which stands in need of yet another Gift to discern which is the best, where all are praiseworthy. And that division also might be called noble of which David says, Drown O Lord and divide their tongues.  Why? Because they loved all words of drowning, the deceitful tongue.  Where he all but expressly arraigns the tongues of the present day  which sever the Godhead. Thus much upon this point.</p>

<p>XVII. Next, since it was to inhabitants of Jerusalem, most devout <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, Egyptians, and Libyans, Cretans too, and Arabians, and Mesopotamians, and my own Cappadocians, that the tongues spoke, and to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (if any one prefer so to understand it), out of every nation under heaven there collected; it is worth while to see who these were and of what captivity. For the captivity in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> was circumscribed, and moreover had long since been brought to an end by the Return; and that under the Romans, which was exacted for their audacity against our Saviour, was not yet come to pass, though it was in the near future. It remains then to understand it of the captivity under Antiochus, which happened not so very long before this time. But if any does not accept this explanation, as being too elaborate, seeing that this captivity was neither ancient nor widespread over the world, and is looking for a more reliable&mdash; perhaps the best way to take it would be as follows. The nation was removed many times, as Esdras related; and some of the Tribes were recovered, and some were left behind; of whom probably (dispersed as they were among the nations) some would have been present and shared the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>.</p>

<p>XVIII. These questions have been examined before by the studious, and perhaps not without occasion; and whatever else any one may contribute at the present day, he will be joined with us. But now it is our duty to dissolve this Assembly, for enough has been said. But the Festival is never to be put an end to; but kept now indeed with our bodies; but a little later on altogether spiritually there, where we shall see the reasons of these things more purely and clearly, in the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> Himself, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the True Festival and Rejoicing of the Saved&mdash; to Whom be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the worship, with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, now and for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
