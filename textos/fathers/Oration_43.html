<h1>Oration 43</h1>

<p><strong>Funeral Oration on the Great S. Basil, Bishop of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia.</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">S. Basil died January 1, A.D. 379. A serious illness, in addition to other causes, prevented S. Gregory from being present at his funeral (Epist. 79). Beno&icirc;t holds that an expression (Epitaph, cxix. 38) in which S. Gregory says that his <q>lips are fettered</q> proves that he was still in retirement at Seleucia. This is an unwarranted deduction. In this Oration, &sect; 2, the Saint, alluding to his illness in disparaging terms, alleges his labours at Constantinople as a more pressing reason for his absence: and says that he undertook the task according to the judgment of S. Basil. This implies that S. Gregory went to Constantinople before the death of S. Basil, or that he had then been influenced by his friend's advice and was on the point of setting out&mdash; more probably the former, as we may be sure that, if S. Gregory had been still at Seleucia, no reason but physical incapacity would have kept him from his friend's side. His pressing duties at Constantinople and the difficulties of the long journey were the <q>other causes</q> of his letter to S. Gregory of Nyssa: and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he suffered from serious illness at Constantinople (Carm. xi. 887. Orat. xxiii. 1). S. Gregory left Constantinople in June, A.D. 381, and Tillemont places the date of this Oration soon after his return to Nazianzus. Beno&icirc;t thinks that it was probably delivered on the anniversary of S. Basil's death. The Oration, as all critics are agreed, is one of great power and beauty. Its length (62 pages folio), the physical weakness of the speaker, and the limits of the endurance of even an interested audience, incline us to suppose that it was not spoken in its present form. We cannot well set aside expressions which clearly point to actual delivery, but it may have been amplified later.</span> </p>

<p>1. It has then been ordained that the great Basil, who used so constantly to furnish me with subjects for my discourses, of which he was quite as <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> as any other man of his own, should himself now furnish me with the grandest subject which has ever fallen to the lot of an orator. For I think that if anyone desired, in making trial of his powers of eloquence, to test them by the standard of that one of all his subjects which he preferred (as painters do with epoch-making pictures), he would choose that which stood first of all others, but would set aside this as beyond the powers of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> eloquence. So great a task is the praise of such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not only to me, who have long ago laid aside all thought of emulation, but even to those who live for eloquence, and whose sole object is the gaining of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by subjects like this. Such is my opinion, and, as I persuade myself, with perfect <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what subject I can treat with eloquence, if not this; or what greater favour I can do to myself, to the admirers of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or to eloquence itself, than express our admiration for this man. To me it is the discharge of a most sacred debt. And our speech is a debt beyond all others due to those who have been gifted, in particular, with powers of speech. To the admirers of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> a discourse is at once a pleasure and an incentive to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For when  I have learned the praises of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, I have a distinct idea of their progress: now, there is none of us all, within whose power it is not to attain to any point whatsoever in that progress. As for eloquence itself, in either case, all must go well with it. For, if the discourse be almost worthy of its subject&mdash; eloquence will have given an exhibition of its power: if it fall far short of it, as must be the case when the praises of Basil are being set forth, by an actual demonstration of its incapacity, it will have declared the superiority of the excellences of its subject to all expression in words.</p>

<p>2. These are the reasons which have urged me to speak, and to address myself to this contest. And at my late appearance, long after his praises have been set forth by so many, who have publicly and privately done him <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, let no one be surprised. Yea, may I be pardoned by that divine <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the object of my constant reverence! And as, when he was among us, he constantly corrected me in many points, according to the rights of a friend and the still higher law; for I am not ashamed to say this, for he was a standard of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to us all; so now, looking down upon me from above, he will treat me with indulgence.  I ask pardon too of any here who are among his warmest admirers, if indeed anyone can be warmer than another, and we are not all abreast in our <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for his good fame. For it is not contempt which has caused me to fall short of what might have been expected of me: nor have I been so regardless of the claims of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or of friendship; nor have I thought that to praise him befitted any other more than me. No! My first reason was, that I shrunk from this task, for I will say the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>  do, who approach their sacred duties before being cleansed both in voice and mind. In the second place, I remind you, though you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it well, of the task  in which I was engaged on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine, which had been properly forced upon me, and had carried me from home, according, as I suppose, to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and certainly according to the judgment of our noble champion of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the breath of whose life was <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> doctrine alone, such as promotes the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the whole world. As for my bodily health, I ought not, perhaps, to dare to mention it, when my subject is a man so doughty in his conquest of the body, even before his removal hence, and who maintained that no powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should suffer hindrance from this our fetter.  So much for my defence. I do not think I need labour it further, in speaking of him to you who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> so clearly my affairs. I must now proceed with my eulogy, commending myself to his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that my commendations may not prove an insult to the man, and that I may not lag far behind all others; even though we all equally fall as far short of his due, as those who look upon the heavens or the rays of the Sun.</p>

<p>3. Had I seen him to be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of his birth, and the rights of birth, or any of those infinitely little objects of those whose eyes are on the ground, we should have had to inspect a new catalogue of the Heroes. What details as to his ancestors might I not have laid under contribution! Nor would even history have had any advantage over me, since I claim this advantage, that his celebrity depends, not upon fiction or legend, but upon actual facts attested by many witnesses. On his father's side <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> offers to me many details, in no wise inferior to its wonders of old time, of which all history and poesy are full;  there are many others concerned with this my native land, of illustrious men of Cappadocia, renowned for its youthful progeny,  no less than for its horses. Accordingly we match with his father's <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> that of his mother. What <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> owns more numerous, or more illustrious generals and governors, or court officials, or again, men of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and lofty thrones, and public honours, and oratorical renown? If it were permitted me to wish to mention them, I would make nothing of the Pelopid&aelig; and Cecropid&aelig;, the Alcm&aelig;onids, the &AElig;acid&aelig;, and Heracleid&aelig;, and other most noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>: inasmuch as they, in default of public merit in their house, betake themselves to the region of uncertainty, claiming demigods and divinities, merely mythical personages, as the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of their ancestors, whose most vaunted details are incredible, and those which we can <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> are an <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>.</p>

<p>4. But since our subject is a man who has maintained that each man's nobility is to be judged of according to his own worth, and that, as forms and colours, and likewise our most celebrated and most <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> horses, are tested by their own properties, so we too ought not to be depicted in borrowed plumes; after mentioning one or two traits, which, though inherited from his ancestors, he made his own by his life, and which are specially likely to give pleasure to my hearers, I will then proceed to deal with the man himself. Different <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> and individuals have different points of distinction and interest, great or small, which, like a patrimony of longer or shorter descent, come down to posterity: the distinction of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> on either side was <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, which I now proceed to display.</p>

<p>5. There was a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the most frightful and severe of all; I mean, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Maximinus, which, following closely upon those which immediately preceded it, made them all seem gentle, by its excessive audacity, and by its eagerness to win the crown of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> in impiety. It was overcome by many of our champions, who wrestled with it to the death, or nearly to the death, with only life enough left in them to survive their victory, and not pass away in the midst of the struggle; remaining to be trainers  in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, living witnesses, breathing trophies, silent exhortations, among whose numerous ranks were found Basil's paternal ancestors, upon whom, in their practice of every form of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, that period bestowed many a fair garland. So prepared and determined were they to bear readily all those things on account of which Christ crowns those who have imitated His struggle on our behalf.</p>

<p>6. But since their strife must needs be lawful, and the law of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> alike forbids us voluntarily to go to meet it (in consideration for the persecutors, and for the weak) or to shrink from it if it comes upon us; for the former shows foolhardiness, the latter cowardice; in this respect they paid due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the Lawgiver; but what was their device, or rather, to what were they led by the Providence which guided them in all things? They betook themselves to a thicket on the mountains of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, of which there are many deep ones of considerable extent, with very few comrades of their flight, or attendants upon their needs. Let others marvel at the length of time, for their flight was exceedingly prolonged, to about seven years, or a little more, and their mode of life, delicately nurtured as they were, was straitened and unusual, as may be imagined, with the discomfort of its exposure to frost and heat and rain: and the wilderness allowed no fellowship or converse with friends: a great trial to men accustomed to the attendance and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of a numerous retinue. But I will proceed to speak of what is still greater and more extraordinary: nor will anyone fail to credit it, save those who, in their feeble and dangerous judgment, think little of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> and dangers for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake.</p>

<p>7. These noble men, suffering from the lapse of time, and feeling a distaste for ordinary food, felt a longing for something more appetising. They did not indeed speak as <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> did,  for they were not murmurers <span class="stiki" id="note314405"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:10</a></span> like them, in their afflictions in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, after the escape from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>&mdash; that <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> would have been better for them than the wilderness, in the bountiful supply of its flesh-pots, and other dainties which they had left behind them there, for the brickmaking and the clay seemed nothing to them then in their folly&mdash; but in a more <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and faithful manner. For why, said they, is it incredible that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of wonders, who bountifully fed <span class="stiki" id="note314406"><a href="../bible/exo016.htm#verse13">Exodus&nbsp;16:13</a></span> in the wilderness his homeless and fugitive people, raining bread upon them, and abounding in quails, nourishing them not only with necessaries, but even with luxuries: that He, Who divided the sea,  and stayed the sun,  and parted the river, with all the other things that He has done; for under such circumstances the mind is wont to recur to history, and sing the praises of God's many wonders: that He, they went on, should feed us champions of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> with dainties today? Many animals which have escaped the tables of the rich, have their lairs in these mountains, and many eatable birds fly over our longing heads, any of which can surely be caught at the mere fiat of Your will! At these words, their quarry lay before them, with food come of its own accord, a complete banquet prepared without effort, stags appearing all at once from some place in the hills. How splendid they were! How fat! How ready for the slaughter! It might almost be imagined that they were annoyed at not having been summoned earlier. Some of them made signs to draw others after them, the rest followed their lead. Who pursued and drove them? No one. What riders? What kind of dogs, what barking, or cry, or young men who had occupied the exits according to the rules of the chase? They were the prisoners of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and righteous petition. Who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> such a hunt among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of this, or any day?</p>

<p>8. O what a wonder! They were themselves stewards of the chase; what they would, was caught by the mere will to do so; what was left, they sent away to the thickets, for another meal. The cooks were extemporised, the dinner exquisite, the guests were grateful for this wonderful foretaste of their hopes. And hence they grew more earnest in their struggle, in return for which they had received this blessing. Such is my history. And do thou, my persecutor, in your admiration for legends, tell of your huntresses,  and Orions, and Act&aelig;ons, those ill-fated hunters, and the hind substituted for the maiden,  if any such thing rouses you to emulation, and if we grant that this story is no legend. The sequel of the tale is too disgraceful. For what is the benefit of the exchange, if a maiden is saved to be taught to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> her guests, and learn to requite humanity with inhumanity? Let this one instance, such as it is, chosen out of many, represent the rest, as far as I am concerned. I have not related it to contribute to his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>: for neither does the sea stand in need of the rivers which flow into it, many and great though they be, nor does the present subject of my praises need any contributions to his fair fame. No! My object is to exhibit the character of his ancestors, and the example before his eyes, which he so far excelled. For if other men find it a great additional advantage to receive somewhat of their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> from their forefathers, it is a greater thing for him to have made such an addition to the original stock that the stream seems to have run uphill.</p>

<p>9. The union of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, cemented as it was by a community of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, no less than by cohabitation, was notable for many reasons, especially for generosity to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, for hospitality, for purity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as the result of self-discipline, for the dedication to God of a portion of their property, a matter not as yet so much cared for by most men, as it now has grown to be, in consequence of such previous examples, as have given distinction to it, and for all those other points, which have been published throughout <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> and Cappadocia, to the satisfaction of many: in my opinion, however, their greatest claim to distinction is the excellence of their children. Legend indeed has its instances of men whose children were many and beautiful, but it is practical experience which has presented to us these <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, whose own character, apart from that of their children, was sufficient for their fair fame, while the character of their children would have made them, even without their own eminence in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to surpass all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by the excellence of their children. For the attainment of distinction by one or two of their offspring might be ascribed to their nature; but when all are eminent, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is clearly due to those who brought them up. This is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the blessed roll of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and of those who, when married, have allowed nothing in their union to hinder them from attaining an equal repute, and so have made the distinction between them to consist in the condition, rather than in the mode of their life.</p>

<p>10. Who has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Basil, our <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> father, a great name to everyone, who attained a father's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, if anyone, I will not say as no one, ever did? For he surpassed all in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and was only prevented by his son from gaining the first prize. Who has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Emmelia, whose name was a forecast of what she became, or else whose life was an exemplification of her name? For she had a right to the name which implies gracefulness, and occupied, to speak concisely, the same place among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, as her husband among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. So that, when it was decided that he, in whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> we are met, should be given to men to submit to the bondage of nature, as anyone of old has been given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the common advantage, it was neither fitting that he should be born of other <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, nor that they should possess another son: and so the two things suitably concurred. I have now, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the Divine law which bids us to pay all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, bestowed the firstfruits of my praises upon those whom I have commemorated, and proceed to treat of Basil himself, premising this, which I think will seem <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to all who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him, that we only need his own voice to pronounce his eulogium. For he is at once a brilliant subject for praise, and the only one whose powers of speech make him worthy of treating it. Beauty indeed and strength and size, in which I see that most men <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, I concede to anyone who will&mdash; not that even in these points he was inferior to any of those men of small minds who busy themselves about the body, while he was still young, and had not yet reduced the flesh by austerity&mdash; but that I may avoid the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of unskilful athletes, who waste their strength in vain efforts after minor objects, and so are worsted in the crucial struggle, whose results are victory and the distinction of the crown. The praise, then, which I shall claim for him is based upon grounds which no one, I think, will consider superfluous, or beyond the scope of my oration.</p>

<p>11. I take it as admitted by men of sense, that the first of our advantages is education; and not only this our more noble form of it, which disregards rhetorical ornaments and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and holds to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and beauty in the objects of our <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>: but even that external culture which many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> ill-judgingly abhor, as treacherous and dangerous, and keeping us afar from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For as we ought not to neglect the heavens, and earth, and air, and all such things, because some have wrongly seized upon them, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> God's works instead of God: but to reap what advantage we can from them for our life and enjoyment, while we avoid their dangers; not raising creation, as foolish men do, in revolt against the Creator, but from the works of nature apprehending the Worker,  and, as the divine apostle says, bringing into captivity every thought to Christ: <span class="stiki" id="note314412"><a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:5</a></span> and again, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that neither fire, nor food, nor iron, nor any other of the elements, is of itself most useful, or most harmful, except according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of those who use it; and as we have compounded healthful drugs from certain of the reptiles; so from secular literature we have received principles of enquiry and speculation, while we have rejected their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, terror, and pit of destruction. Nay, even these have aided us in our religion, by our perception of the contrast between what is worse and what is better, and by gaining strength for our doctrine from the weakness of theirs. We must not then dishonour education, because some men are pleased to do so, but rather suppose such men to be boorish and uneducated, desiring all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be as they themselves are, in order to hide themselves in the general, and escape the detection of their want of culture. But come now, and, after this sketch of our subject and these admissions, let us contemplate the life of Basil.</p>

<p>12. In his earliest years he was swathed and fashioned, in that best and purest fashioning which the Divine David speaks of as proceeding day by day,  in contrast with that of the night, under his great father, acknowledged in those days by <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, as its common teacher of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Under him then, as life and reason grew and rose together, our illustrious friend was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>: not boasting of a Thessalian mountain cave, as the workshop of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, nor of some braggart Centaur,  the tutor of the heroes of his day: nor was he taught under such tuition to shoot hares, and run down fawns, or hunt stags, or excel in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, or in breaking colts, using the same person as teacher and horse at once; nor nourished on the fabulous marrows of stags and lions, but he was trained in general education, and practised in the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, to speak concisely, led on by elementary instructions to his future perfection. For those who are successful in life or in letters only, while deficient in the other, seem to me to differ in nothing from one-eyed men, whose loss is great, but their deformity greater, both in their own eyes, and in those of others. While those who attain eminence in both alike, and are ambidextrous, both possess perfection, and pass their life with the blessedness of heaven. This is what befell him, who had at home a model of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in well-doing, the very sight of which made him excellent from the first. As we see foals and calves skipping beside their mothers from their birth, so he too, running close beside his father in foal-like wantonness, without being left far behind in his lofty impulses toward <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or, if you will, sketching out and showing traces of the future beauty of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and drawing the outlines of perfection before the time of perfection arrived.</p>

<p>13. When sufficiently trained at home, as he ought to fall short in no form of excellence, and not be surpassed by the busy bee, which gathers what is most useful from every flower, he set out for the city of C&aelig;sarea,  to take his place in the schools there, I mean this illustrious city of ours, for it was the guide and mistress of my studies, the metropolis of letters, no less than of the cities which she excels and reigns over: and if any one were to deprive her of her literary power, he would rob her of her fairest and special distinction. Other cities take <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in other ornaments, of ancient or of recent date, that they may have something to be described or to be seen. Letters form our distinction here, and are our badge, as if upon the field of arms or on the stage. His subsequent life let those detail who trained him, or enjoyed his training, as to what he was to his masters, what he was to his classmates, equalling the former, surpassing the latter in every form of culture, what renown he won in a short time from all, both of the common people, and of the leaders of the state; by showing both a culture beyond his years, and a steadfastness of character beyond his culture. An orator among orators, even before the chair of the rhetoricians,  a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> among <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, even before the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>: highest of all a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> even before the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. So much deference was paid to him in every respect by all. Eloquence was his by-work, from which he culled enough to make it an assistance to him in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, since power of this kind is needed to set forth the objects of our <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> which cannot express itself is like the motion of a man in a lethargy. His pursuit was <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and breaking from the world, and fellowship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by concerning himself, amid things below, with things above, and winning, where all is unstable and fluctuating, the things which are stable and remain.</p>

<p>14. Thence to Byzantium, the imperial city of the East, for it was distinguished by the eminence of its rhetorical and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> teachers, whose most valuable lessons he soon assimilated by the quickness and force of his powers: thence he was sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by his generous craving for culture, to Athens the home of letters. Athens, which has been to me, if to any one, a city <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> of gold, and the patroness of all that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For it brought me to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Basil more perfectly, though he had not been unknown to me before; and in my pursuit of letters, I attained to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; and in another fashion had the same experience as Saul, <span class="stiki" id="note314417"><a href="../bible/1sa009.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;9:3</a></span> who, seeking his father's asses, found a kingdom, and gained incidentally what was of more importance than the object which he had in view. Hitherto my course has been clear, leading me in my encomiums along a level and easy, in fact, a king's highway: henceforth I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to speak or whither to turn: for my task is becoming arduous. For here I am anxious, and seize this opportunity to add from my own experience somewhat to my speech, and to dwell a little upon the recital of the causes and circumstances which originated our friendship, or to speak more strictly, our unity of life and nature. For as our eyes are not ready to turn from attractive objects, and, if we violently tear them away, are wont to return to them again; so do we linger in our description of what is most sweet to us. I am afraid of the difficulty of the undertaking. I will try, however, to use all possible moderation. And if I am at all overpowered by my regret, pardon this most righteous of all feelings, the absence of which would be a great loss, in the eyes of men of feeling.</p>

<p>15. We were contained by Athens, like two branches of some river-stream, for after leaving the common fountain of our fatherland, we had been separated in our varying pursuit of culture, and were now again united by the impulsion of God no less than by our own agreement. I preceded him by a little, but he soon followed me, to be welcomed with great and brilliant hope. For he was versed in many languages, before his arrival, and it was a great thing for either of us to outstrip the other in the attainment of some object of our study. And I may well add, as a seasoning to any speech, a short narrative, which will be a reminder to those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, a source of information to those who do not. Most of the young men at Athens in their folly are mad after rhetorical skill&mdash; not only those who are ignobly born and unknown, but even the noble and illustrious, in the general mass of young men difficult to keep under control. They are just like men devoted to horses and exhibitions, as we see, at the horse-races; they leap,  they shout, raise clouds of dust, they drive in their seats, they beat the air, (instead of the horses) with their fingers as whips, they yoke and unyoke the horses, though they are none of theirs: they readily exchange with one another drivers, horses, positions, leaders: and who are they who do this? Often poor and needy fellows, without the means of support for a single day. This is just how the students feel in regard to their own tutors, and their rivals, in their eagerness to increase their own numbers and thereby enrich them. The matter is absolutely absurd and silly. Cities, roads, harbours, mountain tops, coastlines, are seized upon&mdash; in short, every part of Attica, or of the rest of Greece, with most of the inhabitants; for even these they have divided between the rival parties.</p>

<p>16. Whenever any newcomer arrives, and falls into the hands of those who seize upon him, either by force or willingly, they observe this Attic law, of combined jest and earnest. He is first conducted to the house of one of those who were the first to receive him, or of his friends, or kinsmen, or countrymen, or of those who are eminent in debating power, and purveyors of arguments, and therefore especially honoured among them; and their reward consists in the gain of adherents. He is next subjected to the raillery of any one who will, with the intention I suppose, of checking the conceit of the newcomers, and reducing them to subjection at once. The raillery is of a more insolent or argumentative kind, according to the boorishness or refinement of the railer: and the performance, which seems very fearful and brutal to those who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, is to those who have experienced it very pleasant and humane: for its threats are feigned rather than real. Next, he is conducted in procession through the market place to the bath. The procession is formed by those who are charged with it in the young man's <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, who arrange themselves in two ranks separated by an interval, and precede him to the bath. But when they have approached it, they shout and leap wildly, as if possessed, shouting that they must not advance, but stay, since the bath will not admit them; and at the same time frighten the youth by furiously knocking at the doors: then allowing him to enter, they now present him with his freedom, and receive him after the bath as an equal, and one of themselves. This they consider the most pleasant part of the ceremony, as being a speedy exchange and relief from annoyances. On this occasion I not only refused to put to shame my friend the great Basil, out of respect for the gravity of his character, and the ripeness of his reasoning powers, but also persuaded all the rest of the students to treat him likewise, who happened not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him. For he was from the first respected by most of them, his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> having preceded him. The result was that he was the only one to escape the general rule, and be accorded a greater <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> than belongs to a freshman's position.</p>

<p>17. This was the prelude of our friendship. This was the kindling spark of our union: thus we felt the wound of mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Then something of this kind happened, for I think it right not to omit even this. I find the Armenians to be not a simple race, but very crafty and cunning. At this time some of his special comrades and friends, who had been intimate with him even in the early days of his father's instruction, for they were members of his school, came up to him under the guise of friendship, but with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, and not kindly intent, and put to him questions of a disputations rather than rational kind, trying to overwhelm him at the first onset, having <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> his original natural endowments, and unable to brook the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> he had then received. For they thought it a strange thing that they who had put on their gowns, and been exercised in shouting, should not get the better of one who was a stranger and a novice. I also, in my vain <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Athens, and trusting to their professions without perceiving their <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, when they were giving way, and turning their backs, since I was indignant that in their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of Athens should be destroyed, and so speedily put to shame, supported the young men, and restored the argument; and by the aid of my additional weight, for in such cases a small addition makes all the difference, and, as the poet says, <q>made equal their heads in the fray.</q>  But, when I perceived the secret motive of the dispute, which could no longer be kept under, and was at last clearly exposed, I at once drew back, and retired from their ranks, to range myself on his side, and made the victory decisive. He was at once delighted at what had happened, for his sagacity was remarkable, and being filled with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, to describe him fully in Homer's language, he pursued in confusion  with argument those valiant youths, and, smiting them with syllogisms, only ceased when they were utterly routed, and he had distinctly won the honours due to his power. Thus was kindled again, no longer a spark, but a manifest and conspicuous blaze of friendship.</p>

<p>18. Their efforts having thus <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> fruitless, while they severely blamed their own rashness, they cherished such annoyance against me that it broke out into open hostility, and a charge of treachery, not only to them, but to Athens herself: inasmuch as they had been confuted and put to shame at the first onset, by a single student, who had not even had time to gain confidence. He moreover, according to that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feeling, which makes us, when we have all at once attained to the high hopes which we have cherished, look upon their results as inferior to our expectation, he, I say, was displeased and annoyed, and could take no delight in his arrival. He was seeking for what he had expected, and called Athens an empty <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. I however tried to remove his annoyance, both by argumentative encounter, and by the enchantments of reasoning; alleging, as is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that the disposition of a man cannot at once be detected, without a long time and more constant association, and that culture likewise is not made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to those who make trial of her, after a few efforts and in a short time. In this way I restored his cheerfulness, and by this mutual experience, he was the more closely united to me.</p>

<p>19. And when, as time went on, we acknowledged our mutual affection, and that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>  was our aim, we were all in all to one another, housemates, messmates, intimates, with one object in life, or an affection for each other ever growing warmer and stronger. Love for bodily attractions, since its objects are fleeting, is as fleeting as the flowers of spring. For the flame cannot survive, when the fuel is exhausted, and departs along with that which kindles it, nor does desire abide, when its incentive wastes away. But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is godly and under restraint, since its object is stable, not only is more lasting, but, the fuller its vision of beauty grows, the more closely does it bind to itself and to one another the hearts of those whose <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has one and the same object. This is the law of our superhuman <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. I feel that I am being unduly borne away, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to enter upon this point, yet I cannot restrain myself from describing it. For if I have omitted anything, it seems, immediately afterwards, of pressing importance, and of more consequence than what I had preferred to mention. And if any one would carry me tyrannically forward, I become like the polyps, which when they are being dragged from their holes, cling with their suckers to the rocks, and cannot be detached, until the last of these has had exerted upon it its necessary share of force. If then you give me leave, I have my request, if not I must take it from myself.</p>

<p>20. Such were our feelings for each other, when we had thus supported, as Pindar  has it, our <q>well-built chamber with pillars of gold,</q> as we advanced under the united influences of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and our own affection. Oh! How can I mention these things without tears.</p>

<p>We were impelled by equal hopes, in a pursuit especially obnoxious to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, that of letters. Yet <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, and emulation was of service to us. We struggled, not each to gain the first place for himself, but to yield it to the other; for we made each other's <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> to be our own. We seemed to have one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, inhabiting two bodies. And if we must not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> those whose doctrine is <q>All things  are in all;</q> yet in our case it was worthy of belief, so did we live in and with each other. The sole business of both of us was <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and living for the hopes to come, having retired from this world, before our actual departure hence. With a view to this, were directed all our life and actions, under the guidance of the commandment, as we sharpened upon each other our weapons of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and if this is not a great thing for me to say, being a rule and standard to each other, for the distinction between what was right and what was not. Our associates were not the most dissolute, but the most sober of our comrades; not the most pugnacious, but the most peaceable, whose intimacy was most profitable: <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is more easy to be tainted with <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, than to impart <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; just as we can more readily be infected with a disease, than bestow health. Our most cherished studies were not the most pleasant, but the most excellent; this being one means of forming young minds in a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> or vicious mould.</p>

<p>21. Two ways were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us, the first of greater value, the second of smaller consequence: the one leading to our sacred buildings and the teachers there, the other to secular instructors. All others we left to those who would pursue them&mdash; to feasts, theatres, meetings, banquets. For nothing is in my opinion of value, save that which leads to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and to the improvement of its devotees. Different men have different names, derived from their fathers, their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, their pursuits, their exploits: we had but one great business and name&mdash; to be and to be called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of which we thought more than Gyges  of the turning of his ring, if this is not a legend, on which depended his Lydian sovereignty: or than Midas  did of the gold through which he perished, in answer to his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that all he had might turn to gold&mdash; another Phrygian legend. For why should I speak of the arrow of the Hyperborean Abaris,  or of the Argive Pegasus,  to whom flight through the air was not of such consequence as was to us our rising to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through the help of, and with each other? Hurtful as Athens was to others in spiritual things, and this is of no slight consequence to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, for the city is richer in those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> riches&mdash; <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>&mdash; than the rest of Greece, and it is hard to avoid being carried along with their devotees and adherents, yet we, our minds being closed up and fortified against this, suffered no injury. On the contrary, strange as it may seem, we were thus the more confirmed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, from our perception of their trickery and unreality, which led us to despise these divinities in the very home of their worship. And if there is, or is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be, a river  flowing with fresh water through the sea, or an animal  which can dance in fire, the consumer of all things, such were we among all our comrades.</p>

<p>22. And, best of all, we were surrounded by a far from ignoble band, under his instruction and guidance, and delighting in the same objects, as we ran on foot beside that Lydian car,  his own course and disposition: and so we became famous, not only among our own teachers and comrades, but even throughout Greece, and especially in the eyes of its most distinguished men. We even passed beyond its boundaries, as was made clear by the evidence of many. For our instructors were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Athens, and all who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> us, as the subject of conversation, being actually looked upon, or heard of by report, as an illustrious pair. Orestes and Pylades  were in their eyes nothing to us, or the sons of Molione,  the wonders of the Homeric scroll, celebrated for their union in misfortune, and their splendid driving, as they shared in reins and whip alike. But I have been unawares betrayed into praising myself, in a manner I would not have allowed in another. And it is no wonder that I gained here in some advantage from his friendship, and that, as in life he aided me in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so since his departure he has contributed to my renown. But I must return to my proper course.</p>

<p>23. Who possessed such a degree of the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of old age, even before his hair was gray? Since it is by this that Solomon defines old age. <span class="stiki" id="note314433"><a href="../bible/wis004.htm#verse8">Wisdom&nbsp;4:8</a></span> Who was so respectful to both old and young, not only of our contemporaries, but even of those who long preceded him? Who, owing to his character, was less in need of education? Yet who, even with his character, was so imbued with learning? What branch of learning did he not traverse; and that with unexampled success, passing through all, as no one else passed through any one of them: and attaining such eminence in each, as if it had been his sole study? The two great sources of power in the arts and sciences, ability and application, were in him equally combined. For, because of the pains he took, he had but little need of natural quickness, and his natural quickness made it unnecessary for him to take pains; and such was the cooperation and unity of both, that it was hard to see for which of the two he was more remarkable. Who had such power in Rhetoric, which breathes  with the might of fire, different as his disposition was from that of rhetoricians? Who in Grammar, which perfects our tongues in Greek and compiles history, and presides over metres and legislates for poems? Who in Philosophy, that really lofty and high reaching science, whether practical and speculative, or in that part of it whose oppositions and struggles are concerned with <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> demonstrations; which is called Dialectic, and in which it was more difficult to elude his verbal toils, if need required, than to escape from the Labyrinths?  Of Astronomy, Geometry, and numerical proportion he had such a grasp, that he could not be baffled by those who are clever in such sciences: excessive application to them he despised, as useless to those whose desire is godliness: so that it is possible to admire what he chose more than what he neglected, or what he neglected more than what he chose. Medicine, the result of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and laboriousness, was rendered necessary for him by his physical delicacy, and his care of the sick. From these beginnings he attained to a mastery of the art, not only in its empirical and practical branches, but also in its theory and principles. But what are these, illustrious though they be, compared with the moral discipline of the man? To those who have had experience of him, Minos and Rhadamanthus  were mere trifles, whom the Greeks thought worthy of the meadows of Asphodel and the Elysian plains, which are their representations of our Paradise, derived from those books of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> which are also ours, for though their terms are different, this is what they refer to under other names.</p>

<p>24. Such was the case, and his galleon was laden with all the learning attainable by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of man; for beyond Cadiz  there is no passage. There was left no other need but that of rising to a more perfect life, and grasping those hopes upon which we were agreed. The day of our departure was at hand, with its attendant speeches of farewell, and of escort, its invitations to return, its lamentations, embraces and tears. For there is nothing so painful to any one, as is separation from Athens and one another, to those who have been comrades there. On that occasion was seen a piteous spectacle, worthy of record. Around us were grouped our fellow students and classmates and some of our teachers, protesting amid entreaties, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and persuasion, that, whatever happened, they would not let us go; saying and doing everything that men in distress could do. And here I will bring an accusation against myself, and also, daring though it be, against that divine and irreproachable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For he, by detailing the reasons of his anxiety to return home, was able to prevail over their desire to retain him, and they were compelled, though with reluctance, to agree to his departure. But I was left behind at Athens, partly, to say the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because I had been prevailed on&mdash; partly because he had betrayed me, having been persuaded to forsake and hand over to his captors one who refused to forsake him. A thing incredible, before it happened. For it was like cutting one body into two, to the destruction of either part, or the severance of two bullocks who have shared the same manger and the same yoke, amid pitiable bellowings after one another in protest against the separation. However, my loss was not of long duration, for I could not long bear to be seen in piteous plight, nor to have to account to every one for our separation: so, after a brief stay at Athens, my longing desire made me, like the horse in Homer, to burst the bonds of those who restrained me, and prancing o'er the plains, rush to my mate.</p>

<p>25. Upon our return, after a slight indulgence to the world and the stage, sufficient to gratify the general desire, not from any inclination to theatrical display, we soon became independent, and, after being promoted from the rank of beardless boys to that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, made bold advances along the road of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, for though no longer together, since <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> would not allow this, we were united by our eager desire. The city of C&aelig;sarea took possession of him, as a second founder and patron, but in course of time he was occasionally absent, as a matter of necessity due to our separation, and with a view to our determined course of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Dutiful attendance on my aged <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and a succession of misfortunes kept me apart from him, perhaps without right or <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but so it was. And to this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> I am inclined to ascribe all the inconsistency and difficulty which have befallen my life, and the hindrances in the way of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, which have been unworthy of my desire and purpose. But as for my <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, let it lead whither God pleases, only may its course be the better for his intercessions. As regards himself, the manifold <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God toward man, <span class="stiki" id="note314438"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse4">Titus&nbsp;3:4</a></span> and His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> care for our race did, after showing forth his merits under many intervening circumstances with ever greater brilliancy, set him up as a conspicuous and celebrated light for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, by advancing him to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thrones of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, to blaze forth, through the single city of C&aelig;sarea, to the whole world. And in what manner? Not by precipitate advancement, nor by at once cleansing and making him wise, as is the wont of many present candidates for preferment: but bestowing upon him the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in the due order of spiritual advancement.</p>

<p>26. For I do not praise the disorder and irregularity which sometimes exist among us, even in those who preside over the sanctuary. I do not venture, nor is it just, to accuse them all. I approve the nautical custom, which first gives the oar to the future steersman, and afterward leads him to the stern, and entrusts him with the command, and seats him at the helm, only after a long course of striking the sea and observing the winds. As is the case again in military affairs: private, captain, general. This order is the best and most advantageous for their subordinates. And if it were so in our case, it would be of great service. But, as it is, there is a danger of the holiest of all offices being the most ridiculous among us. For promotion depends not upon <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but upon villany; and the sacred thrones fall not to the most Worthy, but to the most powerful. Samuel, the seer into futurity, is among the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: but Saul, the rejected one, is also there. Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, is among the kings, but so also is <a href="../cathen/08340a.htm">Jeroboam</a>, the slave and <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>. And there is not a physician, or a painter who has not first studied the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of diseases, or mixed many colours, or practised drawing: but a prelate is easily found, without laborious training, with a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of recent date, being sown and springing up in a moment, as the legend  of the giants goes. We manufacture those who are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in a day, and bid those to be wise, who have had no instruction, and have contributed nothing before to their dignity, except the will. So one man is content with an inferior position, and abides in his low estate, who is worthy of a lofty one, and has meditated much on the inspired words, and has reduced the flesh by many <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> into subjection to the spirit: while the other haughtily takes precedence, and raises his eyebrow over his betters, and does not tremble at his position, nor is he appalled at the sight, seeing the disciplined man beneath him; and wrongly supposes himself to be his superior in wisdom as well as in rank, having lost his senses under the influence of his position.</p>

<p>27. Not so our great and illustrious Basil. In this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as in all others, he was a public example. For he first read to the people the sacred books, while already able to expound them, nor did he deem himself worthy of this rank  in the sanctuary, and thus proceeded to praise the Lord in the seat of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a>,  and next in that of the Bishops, attaining the office neither by stealth nor by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, instead of seeking for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, being sought for by it, and receiving it not as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> favour, but as from God and divine. The account of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> must be deferred: over his subordinate ministry let us linger a while, for indeed it had almost escaped me, in the midst of my discourse.</p>

<p>28. There arose a disagreement between him and his predecessor  in the rule over this Church: its source and character it is best to pass over in silence, yet it arose. He was a man in other respects far from ignoble, and admirable for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of that time, and the opposition to him, yet his feeling against Basil was one to which men are liable. For Momus seizes not only upon the common herd, but on the best of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, so that it belongs to God alone to be utterly uninfluenced by and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> against such feelings. All the more eminent and wise portion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was roused against him, if those are wiser than the majority who have separated themselves from the world and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> their life to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I mean the Nazarites  of our day, and those who devote themselves to such pursuits. They were annoyed that their chief  should be neglected, insulted, and rejected, and they ventured upon a most dangerous proceeding. They determined to revolt and break off from the body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which admits of no faction, severing along with themselves no small fraction of the people, both of the lower ranks, and of those of position. This was most easy, owing to three very strong reasons. In the first place, the man was held in repute, beyond any other, I think, of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of our time, and able, if he wished, to inspire with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> the conspirators. Next, his opponent  was suspected by the city, in consequence of the tumult which accompanied his institution, of having obtained his preferment in an arbitrary manner, not according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and canons. Also there were present some of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>  of the West, drawing to themselves all the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>29. What then did our noble friend, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the Peaceable One? It was not his habit to resist his traducers or partisans, nor was it his part to fight, or rend the body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which was from other reasons the subject of attack, and hardly bestead, from the great power of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. With my advice and earnest encouragement on the point, he set out from the place with me into <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, and presided over the abodes of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> there. He himself too founded one  worthy of mention, as he welcomed the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> together with Elijah and John,  those professors of austerity; thinking this to be more profitable for him than to form any design in reference to the present juncture unworthy of his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and to ruin in a time of storm the straight course which he was making, where the surges of disputation were lulled to a calm. Yet wonderfully <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> though his retirement was, we shall find his return still more wonderful. For thus it was.</p>

<p>30. While we were thus engaged, there suddenly arose a cloud full of hail, with destructive roar, overwhelming every Church upon which it burst and seized: an Emperor,  most fond of gold and most hostile to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, infected with these two most serious diseases, insatiate <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; a persecutor in succession to the persecutor, and, in succession to the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, not indeed an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, though no better to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, or rather, to the more devout and pure party of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who worship the Trinity, which I call the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> devotion and saving doctrine. For we do not measure out the Godhead into portions, nor banish from Itself by unnatural estrangements the one and unapproachable Nature; nor cure one <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by another, destroying the godless confusion of Sabellius by a more impious severance and division; which was the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, whose name declares his <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>,  the disturber and destroyer of a great part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For he did not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by dishonouring His offspring with his unequal degrees of Godhead. But we recognize one <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>  of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the equality of the Only-begotten; and one <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that of the Spirit. And we hold that, to subordinate any of the Three, is to destroy the whole. For we worship and acknowledge Them as Three in their properties,  but One in their Godhead. He however had no such idea, being unable to look up, but being debased by those who led him, he dared to debase along with himself even the Nature of the Godhead, and became a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> creature reducing Majesty to bondage, and aligning with creation the uncreated and timeless Nature.</p>

<p>31. Such was his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and with such impiety he took the field against us. For we must consider it to be nothing else than a barbaric inroad which, instead of destroying walls, cities and houses, and other things of little worth, made with hands and capable of restoration, spent its ravages upon men's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. A worthy army joined in his assault, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> rulers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, the bitter governors of his world-wide Empire. Some of the Churches they now held, some they were assaulting, others they hoped to gain by the already exercised influence of the Emperor, and the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> which he threatened. But in their purpose of perverting our own, their confidence was specially based on the smallness of mind of those whom I have mentioned, the inexperience of our prelate, and the infirmities which prevailed among us. The struggle would be fierce: the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of numerous troops was far from ignoble, but their array was weak, from the want of a leader and strategist to contend for them with the might of the Word and of the Spirit. What then did this noble and magnanimous and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Christ-loving <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? No need of many words to urge his presence and aid. At once when he saw me on my mission, for the struggle on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was common to us both, he yielded to my entreaty; and decided by a most excellent distinction, based on spiritual reasons, that the time for punctiliousness (if indeed we may give way to such feelings at all) is a time of security, but that forbearance is required in the hour of necessity. He immediately returned with me from <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, and as a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> volunteer took his place in the fight for the endangered <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and devoted himself to the service of his mother, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>32. Did then his actual efforts fall short of his preliminary <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>? Were they directed by <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, but not by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, or by skill, while he shrank from danger? Or, in spite of their unexampled perfection on all these points, was there left in him some trace of irritation? Far from it. He was at once completely reconciled, and took part in every plan and effort. He removed all the thorns and stumbling blocks which were in our way, upon which the enemy relied in their attack upon us. He took hold of one, grasped another, thrust away a third. He became to some a stout wall and rampart, <span class="stiki" id="note314453"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse18">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:18</a></span> to others an axe breaking the rock in pieces,  or a fire among the thorns,  as the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> says, easily destroying those fagots who were insulting the Godhead. And if his Barnabas, who speaks and records these things, was of service to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in the struggle, it is to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> that thanks are due, for choosing and making him his comrade in the strife.</p>

<p>33. Thus the enemy failed, and, base men as they were, for the first time were then basely put to shame and worsted, learning not to be ready to despise the Cappadocians, of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the world, whose special qualities are firmness in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and loyal devotion to the Trinity; to Whom is due their unity and strength, and from Whom they receive an even greater and stronger assistance than they are able to give. Basil's next business and purpose was to conciliate the prelate, to allay suspicion, to persuade all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that the irritation which had been felt was due to the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> and effort of the Evil one, in his <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> concord: carefully complying with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> and spiritual order. Accordingly he visited him, with instruction and advice. While <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to his wishes, he was everything to him, a good counsellor, a skilful assistant, an expounder of the Divine Will, a guide of conduct, a staff for his old age, a support of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, most trusty of those within, most practical of those without, in a word, as much inclined to goodwill, as he had been thought to hostility. And so the power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> came into his hands almost, if not quite, to an equal degree with the occupant of the see. For in return for his good-will, he was requited with authority. And their harmony and combination of power was wonderful. The one was the leader of the people, the other of their leader, like a lion-keeper, skilfully soothing the possessor of power. For, having been recently installed in the see, and still somewhat under the influence of the world, and not yet furnished with the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, in the midst of the eddying tide of enemies assaulting the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he was in need of some one to take him by the hand and support him. Accordingly he accepted the alliance, and imagined himself the conqueror of one who had conquered him.</p>

<p>34. Of his care for and protection of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, there are many other tokens; his boldness towards the governors and other most powerful men in the city: the decisions of disputes, accepted without hesitation, and made effective by his simple word, his inclination being held to be decisive: his support of the needy, most of them in spiritual, not a few also in physical distress: for this also often influences the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and reduces it to subjection by its kindness; the support of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the entertainment of strangers, the care of maidens; legislation  written and unwritten for the monastic life: arrangements of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>,  adornments of the sanctuary, and other ways in which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, working for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, would benefit the people: one being especially important and noteworthy. There was a famine, the most severe one ever recorded. The city was in distress, and there was no source of assistance, or relief for the calamity. For maritime cities are able to bear such times of need without difficulty, by an exchange of their own products for what is imported: but an inland city like ours can neither turn its superfluity to profit, nor supply its need, by either disposing of what we have, or importing what we have not: but the hardest part of all such distress is, the insensibility and insatiability of those who possess supplies. For they watch their opportunities, and turn the distress to profit, and thrive upon misfortune: heeding not that he who shows mercy to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, lends to the Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note314458"><a href="../bible/pro019.htm#verse17">Proverbs&nbsp;19:17</a></span> nor that he that withholds grain, the people shall curse him:  nor any other of the promises to the philanthropic, and threats against the inhuman. But they are too insatiate, in their ill-judged policy; for while they shut up their bowels against their fellows, they shut up those of God against themselves, forgetting that their need of Him is greater than others' need of them. Such are the buyers and sellers of grain, who neither respect their fellows, nor are thankful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from Whom comes what they have, while others are straitened.</p>

<p>35. He indeed could neither rain bread from heaven by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314460"><a href="../bible/exo016.htm#verse15">Exodus&nbsp;16:15</a></span> to nourish an escaped people in the wilderness,  nor supply fountains of food without cost from the depth of vessels which are filled by being emptied, <span class="stiki" id="note314462"><a href="../bible/1ki017.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;17:14</a></span> and so, by an amazing return for her hospitality, support one who supported him; nor feed thousands of men with five loaves whose very fragments were a further supply for many tables. <span class="stiki" id="note314463"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;14:19</a></span> These were the works of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah, and my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from Whom they too derived their power. Perhaps also they were characteristic of their time and its circumstances: since signs are for unbelievers not for those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note314464"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:22</a></span> But he did devise and execute with the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> things which correspond to them, and tend in the same direction. For by his word and advice he opened the stores of those who possessed them, and so, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> dealt food to the hungry, <span class="stiki" id="note314465"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm">Isaiah&nbsp;58:7</a></span> and satisfied the poor with bread,  and fed them in the time of dearth,  and filled the hungry <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things.  And in what way? For this is no slight addition to his praise. He gathered together the victims of the famine with some who were but slightly recovering from it, men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, infants, old men, every age which was in distress, and obtaining contributions of all sorts of food which can relieve famine, set before them basins of soup and such meat as was found preserved among us, on which the poor live. Then, imitating the ministry of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who, girded with a towel, did not disdain to wash the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples'</a> feet, using for this purpose the aid of his own servants, and also of his fellow servants, he attended to the bodies and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of those who needed it, combining personal respect with the supply of their necessity, and so giving them a double relief.</p>

<p>36. Such was our young furnisher of grain, and second Joseph: though of him we can say somewhat more. For the one made a gain from the famine, and bought up <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>  in his philanthropy, by managing the time of plenty with a view to the time of famine, turning to account the dreams of others for that purpose. But the other's services were gratuitous, and his succour of the famine gained no profit, having only one object, to win kindly feelings by kindly treatment, and to gain by his rations of grain the heavenly blessings. Further he provided the nourishment of the Word, and that more perfect bounty and distribution, which is really heavenly and from on high&mdash; if the word be that bread of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,  wherewith <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are fed and given to drink, who are a hungered for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  and seek for a food which does not pass away or fail, but abides forever. This food he, who was the poorest and most needy man whom I have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, supplied in rich abundance to the relief not of a famine of bread, nor of a thirst for water, but a longing for that Word <span class="stiki" id="note314472"><a href="../bible/amo008.htm#verse11">Amos&nbsp;8:11</a></span> which is really lifegiving and nourishing, and causes to grow to spiritual manhood him who is duly fed thereon.</p>

<p>37. After these and similar actions&mdash; why need I stay to mention them all?&mdash; when the prelate whose name  betokened his godliness had passed away, having sweetly breathed his last in Basil's arms, he was raised to the lofty throne of a Bishop, not without difficulty or without the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> struggles of the prelates of his native land, on whose side were found the greatest scoundrels of the city. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> must needs win the day&mdash; and indeed the victory was decisive. For He brought from a distance, to anoint him, men  illustrious and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for godliness, and with them the new <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, our Patriarch, I mean my father, in regard to whom an extraordinary thing happened. For, failing as he was from the number of his years, and worn away almost to his last breath by disease, he ventured on the journey to give assistance by his vote, relying on the aid of the Spirit. In brief, he was placed in his litter, as a corpse is laid in its tomb, to return in the freshness and strength of youth, with head erect, having been strengthened by the imposition of hands and unction, and, it is not too much to say by the head of him who was anointed. This must be added to the instances of old time, which prove that labour bestows health, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> purpose raises the dead, and old age leaps up when anointed by the Spirit.</p>

<p>38. Having thus been deemed worthy of the office of prelate, as it is seemly that men should who have lived such a life, and won such favour and consideration, he did not disgrace, by his subsequent conduct, either his own <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, or the hopes of those who had trusted him. But he ever so far surpassed himself as he has been shown hitherto to have surpassed others, his ideas on this point being most excellent and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a>. For he held that, while it is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> in a private individual to avoid <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and be to some extent good, it is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in a chief and ruler, especially in such an office, to fail to surpass by far the majority of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and by constant progress to make his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> correspond to his dignity and throne: for it is difficult for one in high position to attain the mean, and by his eminence in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> raise up his people to the golden mean. Or rather to treat this question more satisfactorily, I think that the result is the same as I see in the case of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, and of every specially wise man, I fancy, when He was with us in that form which surpassed us and yet is ours. For He also, the gospel says, increased in wisdom and favour, as well as in stature, <span class="stiki" id="note314475"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse52">Luke&nbsp;2:52</a></span> not that these qualities in Him were capable of growth: for how could that which was perfect from the first become more perfect, but that they were gradually disclosed and displayed? So I think that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of Basil, without being itself increased, obtained at this time a wider exercise, since his power provided him with more abundant material.</p>

<p>39. He first of all made it plain that his office had been bestowed upon him, not by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> favour, but by the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This will also be shown by my conduct. For in what <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> research did he not, about that time, join with me? So every one thought that I should run to meet him after what had happened, and show my delight at it (as would, perhaps, have been the case with any one else) and claim a share in his authority, rather than rule beside him, according to the inferences they drew from our friendship. But, in my exceeding anxiety to avoid the annoyance and jealousy of the time, and specially since his position was still a painful and troubled one, I remained at home, and forcibly restrained my eager desire, while, though he blamed me, Basil accepted my excuse. And when, on my subsequent arrival, I refused, for the same reason the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of this chair, and a dignified position  among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a>, he kindly refrained from blaming, nay he praised me, preferring to be charged with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> by a small clique, in their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of our policy, rather than do anything contrary to reason and his own resolutions. And indeed, how could a man have better shown his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be superior to all fawning and flattery, and his single object to be the law of right, than by thus treating me, whom he acknowledged as among the first of his friends and associates?</p>

<p>40. His next task was to appease, and allay by magnanimous treatment, the opposition to himself: and that without any trace of flattery or servility, but in a most chivalrous and magnanimous way; with a view, not merely to present exigencies, but also to the fostering of future <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. For, seeing that, while tenderness leads to laxity and slackness, severity gives rise to stubbornness and self-will, he was able to avoid the dangers of each course by a combination of both, blending his correction with consideration, and gentleness with firmness, influencing men in most cases principally by his conduct rather than by argument: not enslaving them by art, but winning them by good nature, and attracting them by the sparing use, rather than by the constant exercise, of his power. And, most important of all, they were brought to recognize the superiority of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the inaccessibility of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to consider their only safety to consist in being on his side and under his command, their sole danger to be in opposition to him, and to think that to differ from him involved estrangement from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus they willingly yielded and surrendered, submitting themselves, as if in a thunder-clap, and hastening to anticipate each other with their excuses, and exchange the intensity of their hostility for an equal intensity of goodwill, and advance in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which they found to be the one really effective defence. The few exceptions to this conduct were passed by and neglected, because their ill-nature was incurable, and they expended their powers in wearing out themselves, as rust consumes itself together with the iron on which it feeds.</p>

<p>41. Affairs at home being now settled to his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, in a way that faithless men who did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him would have thought impossible, his designs became greater and took a loftier range. For, while all others had their eyes on the ground before them, and directed attention to their own immediate concerns, and, if these were safe, troubled themselves no further, being incapable of any great and chivalrous design or undertaking; he, moderate as he was in all other respects, could not be moderate in this, but with head erect, casting his mental eye about him, took in the whole world over which the word of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> has made its way. And when he saw the great heritage of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, purchased by His own words and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and sufferings, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation, the royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314477"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:9</a></span> in such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> plight that it was torn asunder into ten thousand opinions and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>: and the vine brought out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and transplanted,  the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> of impious and dark <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, which had grown to such beauty and boundless size that the whole earth was covered with the shadow of it, while it overtopped mountains and cedars, now being ravaged by that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> wild boar, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, he could not content himself with quietly lamenting the misfortune, and merely lifting up his hands to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and seeking from Him the dispersion of the pressing misfortunes, while he himself was asleep, but felt bound to come to her aid at some expense to himself.</p>

<p>42. For what could be more distressing than this calamity, or call more loudly on one whose eyes were raised aloft for exertions on behalf of the common good? The good or ill success of an individual is of no consequence to the community, but that of the community involves of necessity the like condition of the individual. With this idea and purpose, he who was the guardian and patron of the community (and, as Solomon says with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, a perceptive heart is a moth to the bones,  unsensitiveness is cheerily confident, while a sympathetic disposition is a source of pain, and constant consideration wastes away the heart), he, I say, was consequently in agony and distress from many wounds; like Jonah and David, he wished in himself to die <span class="stiki" id="note314480"><a href="../bible/jon004.htm#verse8">Jonah&nbsp;4:8</a></span> and gave not sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his eyelids,  he expended what was left of his flesh upon his reflections, until he discovered a remedy for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and sought for aid from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to stay the general conflagration, and dissipate the gloom which was lowering over us.</p>

<p>43. One of his devices was of the greatest service. After a period of such recollection as was possible, and private spiritual conference, in which, after considering all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> arguments, and penetrating into all the deep things of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, he drew up a sketch of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> doctrine, and by wrestling with and attacking their opposition he beat off the daring assaults of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>: overthrowing in hand to hand struggles by word of mouth those who came to close quarters, and striking those at a distance by arrows winged with ink, which is in no wise inferior to inscriptions on tablets; not giving directions for one small nation only like that of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, concerning meats and drinks, temporary <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and purifications of the flesh; <span class="stiki" id="note314482"><a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse10">Hebrews&nbsp;9:10</a></span> but for every nation and part of the world, concerning the Word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the source of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Again, since unreasoning action and unpractical reasoning are alike ineffectual, he added to his reasoning the succour which comes from action; he paid visits, sent messages, gave interviews, instructed, reproved, rebuked, <span class="stiki" id="note314483"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:2</a></span> threatened, reproached, undertook the defence of nations, cities and individuals, devising every kind of succour, and procuring from every source specifics for disease: a second Bezaleel, an architect of the Divine tabernacle, <span class="stiki" id="note314484"><a href="../bible/exo031.htm#verse2">Exodus&nbsp;31:2</a></span> applying every material and art to the work, and combining all in a harmonious and surpassing beauty.</p>

<p>44. Why need I enter into further detail? We were assailed again by the Anti-<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Emperor,  that tyrant of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, with more abundant impiety and a hotter onset, inasmuch as the dispute must be with a stronger antagonist, like that unclean and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit, who when sent forth upon his wanderings from man, returns to take up his abode in him again with a greater number of spirits, as we have heard in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note314486"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse24">Luke&nbsp;11:24</a></span> This spirit he imitated, both in renewing the contest in which he had formerly been worsted, and in adding to his original efforts. He thought that it was a strange and insufferable thing that he, who ruled over so many nations and had won so much renown, and reduced under the power of impiety all those round about him, and overcome every adversary, should be publicly worsted by a single man, and a single city, and so incur the ridicule not only of those patrons of ungodliness by whom he was led, but also, as he supposed, of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</p>

<p>45. It is said that the King  of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, on his expedition into Greece, was not only urged to immoderate threats, by elation at the numbers of every race of men which in his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> he was leading against them: but thought to terrify them the more, by making them afraid of him, in consequence of his novel treatment of the elements. A strange land and sea were heard of, the work of the new creator; and an army which sailed over the dry land, and marched over the ocean, while islands were carried off, and the sea was scourged, and all the other mad proceedings of that army and expedition, which, though they struck terror into the ignoble, were ridiculous in the eyes of men of brave and steadfast hearts. There was no need of anything of this kind in the expedition against us, but what was still worse and more harmful, this was what the Emperor was reported to say and do. He stretched forth his mouth unto heaven, speaking <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the most High, and his tongue went through the world.  Excellently did the inspired David before our days thus describe him who made heaven to stoop to earth, and reckoned with the creation that supermundane nature, which the creation cannot even contain, even though in kindness to man it did to some extent come among us, in order to draw to itself us who were lying upon the ground.</p>

<p>46. Furious indeed were his first acts of wantonness, more <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> still his final efforts against us. What shall I speak of first? Exiles, banishments, confiscations, open and secret plots, persuasion, where time allowed, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, where persuasion was impossible. Those who clung to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as we did, were extruded from their churches; others were intruded, who agreed with the Imperial soul-destroying doctrines, and begged for testimonials of impiety, and subscribed to statements still harder than these. Burnings  of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a> at sea, impious generals, not those who conquered the Persians, or subdued the Scythians, or reduced any other barbaric nation, but those who assailed churches, and danced in triumph upon altars, and defiled the unbloody <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> with the blood of man and victims, and offered insult to the modesty of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. With what object? The extrusion of the Patriarch Jacob,  and the intrusion in his place of <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314491"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;9:11</a></span> even before his birth. This is the description of his first acts of wantonness, the mere recollection and mention of which even now, rouses the tears of most of us.</p>

<p>47. Accordingly, when, after passing through all quarters, he made his attack in order to enslave this impregnable and formidable mother of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, the only still remaining unquenched spark of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he discovered that he had been for the first time ill advised. For he was driven back like a missile which strikes upon some stronger body, and recoiled like a broken hawser. Such was the prelate of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that he met with, such was the bulwark by which his efforts were broken and dissipated. Other particulars may be heard from those who tell and recount them, from their own experience&mdash; and none of those who recount them is destitute of this full experience. But all must be filled with admiration who are aware of the struggles of that time, the assaults, the promises, the threats, the commissioners sent before him to try to prevail upon us, men of judicial and military rank, men from the harem, who are men among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whose only manliness consisted in their impiety, and being incapable of natural licentiousness, commit fornication in the only way they can, with their tongues; the chief cook Nebuzaradan,  who threatened us with the weapons of his art, and was dispatched by his own fire. But what especially excites my wonder, and what I could not, even if I would, pass by, I will describe as concisely as possible.</p>

<p>48. Who has not heard of the prefect  of those days, who, for his own part, treated us with such excessive arrogance, having himself been admitted, or perhaps committed, to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by the other party; and strove by exceeding the letter of his instructions, and gratifying his master in every particular, to guarantee and preserve his own possession of power. Though he raged against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and assumed a lion-like aspect, and roared like a lion till most men dared not approach him, yet our noble prelate was brought into or rather entered his court, as if bidden to a feast, instead of to a trial. How can I fully describe, either the arrogance of the prefect or the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> with which it was met by the Saint. <q>What is the meaning, Sir Basil,</q> he said, addressing him by name, and not as yet deigning to term him Bishop, <q>of your daring, as no other dares, to resist and oppose so great a potentate?</q> <q>In what respect?</q> said our noble champion, <q>and in what does my rashness consist? For this I have yet to learn.</q> <q>In refusing to respect the religion of your Sovereign, when all others have yielded and submitted themselves?</q> <q>Because,</q> said he, <q>this is not the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of my real Sovereign; nor can I, who am the creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and bidden myself to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, submit to worship any creature.</q> <q>And what do we,</q> said the prefect, <q>seem to you to be? Are we, who give you this injunction, nothing at all? What do you say to this? Is it not a great thing to be ranged with us as your associates?</q> <q>You are, I will not deny it,</q> said he, <q>a prefect, and an illustrious one, yet not of more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> than God. And to be associated with you is a great thing, certainly; for you are yourself the creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but so it is to be associated with any other of my subjects. For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and not personal importance, is the distinctive mark of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.</q></p>

<p>49. Then indeed the prefect became excited, and rose from his seat, boiling with rage, and making use of harsher language. <q>What?</q> said he, have you no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of my authority? <q>Fear of what?</q> said Basil, <q>How could it affect me?</q> <q>Of what? Of any one of the resources of my power.</q> <q>What are these?</q> said Basil, <q><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, inform me.</q> <q>Confiscation, banishment, torture, death.</q> <q>Have you no other threat?</q> said he, <q>for none of these can reach me.</q> <q>How indeed is that?</q> said the prefect. <q>Because,</q> he replied, <q>a man who has nothing, is beyond the reach of confiscation; unless you demand my tattered rags, and the few books, which are my only possessions. Banishment is impossible for me, who am confined by no limit of place, counting my own neither the land where I now dwell, nor all of that into which I may be hurled; or, rather, counting it all God's, whose guest and dependent I am. As for tortures, what hold can they have upon one whose body has ceased to be? Unless you mean the first stroke, for this alone is in your power. Death is my benefactor, for it will send me the sooner to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for Whom I live, and exist, and have all but died, and to Whom I have long been hastening.</q></p>

<p>50. Amazed at this language, the prefect said, <q>No one has ever yet spoken thus, and with such boldness, to Modestus.</q> <q>Why, perhaps,</q> said Basil, <q>you have not met with a Bishop, or in his defence of such interests he would have used precisely the same language. For we are modest in general, and submissive to every one, according to the precept of our law. We may not treat with haughtiness even any ordinary person, to say nothing of so great a potentate. But where the interests of God are at stake, we care for nothing else, and make these our sole object. Fire and sword and wild beasts, and rakes which tear the flesh, we revel in, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> them not. You may further insult and threaten us, and do whatever you will, to the full extent of your power. The Emperor himself may hear this&mdash; that neither by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> nor persuasion will you bring us to make common <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> with impiety, not even though your threats become still more terrible.</q></p>

<p>51. At the close of this colloquy, the prefect, having been convinced by the attitude of Basil, that he was absolutely impervious to threats and influence, dismissed him from the court, his former threatening manner being replaced by somewhat of respect and deference. He himself with all speed obtained an audience of the Emperor, and said: <q>We have been worsted, Sire, by the prelate of this Church. He is superior to threats, invincible in argument, uninfluenced by persuasion. We must make trial of some more feeble character; and in this case resort to open <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, or submit to the disregard of our threatenings.</q> Hereupon the Emperor, forced by the praises of Basil to condemn his own conduct (for even an enemy can admire a man's excellence), would not allow <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to be used against him: and, like iron, which is softened by fire, yet still remains iron, though turned from threatening to admiration, would not enter into communion with him, being prevented by shame from changing his course, but sought to justify his conduct by the most plausible excuse he could, as the sequel will show.</p>

<p>52. For he entered the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> attended by the whole of his train; it was the festival of the Epiphany, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was crowded, and, by taking his place among the people, he made a profession of unity. The occurrence is not to be lightly passed over. Upon his entrance he was struck by the thundering roll of the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, by the sea of heads of the congregation, and by the angelic rather than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> order which pervaded the sanctuary and its precincts: while Basil presided over his people, standing erect, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says of Samuel, <span class="stiki" id="note314494"><a href="../bible/1sa019.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;19:20</a></span> with body and eyes and mind undisturbed, as if nothing new had happened, but fixed upon God and the sanctuary, as if, so to say, he had been a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, while his ministers stood around him in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and reverence. At this sight, and it was indeed a sight unparalleled, overcome by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, his eyes were affected with dimness and giddiness, his mind with dread. This was as yet unnoticed by most people. But when he had to offer the gifts at the Table of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which he must needs do himself, since no one would, as usual, assist him, because it was uncertain whether Basil would admit him, his feelings were revealed. For he was staggering, and had not some one in the sanctuary reached out a hand to steady his tottering steps, he would have sunk to the ground in a lamentable fall. So much for this.</p>

<p>53. As for the wisdom of his conference with the Emperor, who, in his quasi-communion with us entered within the veil to see and speak to him, as he had long desired to do, what else can I say but that they were inspired words, which were heard by the courtiers and by us who had entered with them? This was the beginning and first establishment of the Emperor's kindly feeling towards us; the impression produced by this reception put an end to the greater part of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which assailed us like a river.</p>

<p>54. Another incident is not of less importance than those I have mentioned. The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> were victorious, and the decree for his banishment was signed, to the full satisfaction of those who furthered it. The night had come, the chariot was ready, our haters were exultant, the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> in despair, we surrounded the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> traveller, to whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> disgrace nothing was wanting. What next? It was undone by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For He Who smote the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314495"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse29">Exodus&nbsp;12:29</a></span> for its harshness towards <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, also struck the son of the Emperor with disease. How great was the speed! There was the sentence of banishment, here the decree of sickness: the hand of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> scribe was restrained, and the saint was preserved, and the man of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> presented to us, by the fever which brought to reason the arrogance of the Emperor. What could be more just or more speedy than this? This was the series of events: the Emperor's child was sick and in bodily pain. The father was pained for it, for what can the father do? On all sides he sought for aid in his distress, he summoned the best physicians, he betook himself to intercessions with the greatest fervour, and flung himself upon the ground. Affliction humbles even emperors, and no wonder, for the like sufferings of David in the case of his child are recorded for us. <span class="stiki" id="note314496"><a href="../bible/2sa012.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;12:16</a></span> But as no cure for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> could anywhere be found, he applied to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Basil, not personally summoning him, in shame for his recent ill treatment, but entrusting the mission to others of his nearest and dearest friends. On his arrival, without the delay or reluctance which any one else might have shown, at once the disease relaxed, and the father cherished better hopes; and had he not blended <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> water with the fresh, by trusting to the heterodox at the same time that he summoned Basil, the child would have recovered his health and been preserved for his father's arms. This indeed was the conviction of those who were present at the time, and shared in the distress.</p>

<p>55. The same mischance is said to have befallen the prefect. He also was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> by sickness to bow beneath the hands of the Saint, and, in reality, to men of sense a visitation brings instruction, and affliction is often better than prosperity. He fell sick, was in tears, and in pain, he sent for Basil, and entreated him, crying out, <q>I own that you were in the right; only save me!</q> His request was granted, as he himself acknowledged, and convinced many who had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> nothing of it; for he never ceased to wonder at and describe the powers of the prelate. Such was his conduct in these cases, such its result. Did he then treat others in a different way, and engage in petty disputes about trifles, or fail to rise to the heights of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in a course of action which merits no praise and is best passed over in silence? By no means. He who once stirred up the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> Hadad against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314497"><a href="../bible/1ki011.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;11:14</a></span> stirred up against him the prefect  of the province of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>; nominally, from annoyance connected with some poor creature of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but in reality as a part of the struggle of impiety against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. I pass by all his other insults against Basil, or, for it is the same thing, against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for it is against Him and on His behalf that the contest was waged. One instance of it, however, which brought special disgrace upon the assailant, and exalted his adversary, if <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and eminence for it be a great and lofty thing, I will describe at length.</p>

<p>56. The assessor of a judge was attempting to force into a distasteful marriage a lady of high birth whose husband was but recently dead. At a loss to escape from this high-handed treatment, she resorted to a device no less <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> than daring. She fled to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> table, and placed herself under the protection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> against outrage. What, in the Name of the Trinity Itself, if I may introduce into my panegyric somewhat of the forensic style, ought to have been done, I do not say, by the great Basil, who laid down the law for us all in such matters, but by any one who, though far inferior to him, was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>? Ought he not to have allowed her claim, to have taken charge of, and cared for, her; to have raised his hand in defence of the kindness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the law which gives <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the altar? Ought he not to have been willing to do and suffer anything, rather than take part in any inhuman design against her, and outrage at once the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> table, and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in which she had taken sanctuary? No! said the baffled judge, all ought to yield to my authority, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should betray their own <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. The suppliant whom he demanded, was at all hazards retained. Accordingly, in his rage, he at last sent some of the magistrates to search the saint's bedchamber, with the purpose of dishonouring him, rather than from any necessity. What! Search the house of a man so free from passion, whom the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> revere, at whom <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> do not venture even to look? And, not content with this, he summoned him, and put him on his defence; and that, in no gentle or kindly manner, but as if he were a convict. Upon Basil's appearance, standing, like my <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, before the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, he presided at the trial, full of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Yet the thunderbolts did not fall, and the sword of God still glittered, and waited, while His bow, though bent, was restrained. Such indeed is the custom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>57. Consider another struggle between our champion and his persecutor. His ragged <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> having been ordered to be torn away, <q>I will also, if you wish it, strip off my coat,</q> said he. His fleshless form was threatened with blows, and he offered to submit to be torn with combs, and he said, <q>By such laceration you will cure my liver, which, as you see, is wearing me away.</q> Such was their argument. But when the city perceived the outrage and the common danger of all&mdash; for each one considered this insolence a danger to himself, it became all on fire with rage; and, like a hive roused by smoke, one after another was stirred and arose, every race and every age, but especially the men from the small-arms factory and from the imperial weaving-sheds. For men at work in these trades are specially hot-tempered and daring, because of the liberty allowed them. Each man was armed with the tool he was using, or with whatever else came to hand at the moment. Torch in hand, amid showers of stones, with cudgel's ready, all ran and shouted together in their united <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Anger makes a terrible soldier or general. Nor were the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> weaponless, when roused by such an occasion. Their pins were their spears, and no longer remaining <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, they were by the strength of their eagerness endowed with masculine <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. It is a short story. They thought that they would share among themselves the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of destroying him, and held him to be most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> who first laid hands on one who had dared such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. What then was the conduct of this <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> and daring judge? He begged for mercy in a pitiable state of distress, cringing before them to an unparalleled extent, until the arrival of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> without bloodshed, who had won his crown without blows, and now restrained the people by the force of his personal influence, and delivered the man who had insulted him and now sought his protection. This was the doing of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Saints, Who works and changes all things for the best, who resists the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, but gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note314499"><a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse6">James&nbsp;4:6</a></span> And why should not He, Who divided the sea and stayed the river, and ruled the elements, and by stretching out set up a trophy, to save His exiled people, why should not He have also rescued this man from his perils?</p>

<p>58. This was the end and fortunate close, in the Providence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the world, a close worthy of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But here at once is the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Bishops, and their allies, which involved great disgrace, and still greater injury to their subjects. For who could persuade others to be temperate, when such was the conduct of their prelates? For a long time they had been unkindly disposed towards him, on three grounds. They neither agreed with him in the matter of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, except in so far as they were absolutely <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to yield to the majority of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Nor had they altogether laid aside the grudge they owed him for his election. And, what was most grievous of all to them, though they would have been most ashamed to own it&mdash; he so far outshone them in <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>. There was also a further <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of dissension which stirred up again the others. When our country had been divided into two provinces and metropolitical sees, and a great part of the former was being added to the new one, this again roused their factious spirit. The one  thought it right that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> boundaries should be settled by the civil ones: and therefore claimed those newly added, as belonging to him, and severed from their former metropolitan. The other  clung to the ancient custom, and to the division which had come down from our fathers. Many painful results either actually followed, or were struggling in the womb of the future. Synods were wrongfully gathered by the new metropolitan, and revenues seized upon. Some of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of the churches refused <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, others were won over. In consequence the affairs of the churches fell into a sad state of dissension and division. Novelty indeed has a certain charm for men, and they readily turn events to their own advantage, and it is easier to overthrow something which is already established, than to restore it when overthrown. What however enraged him most was, that the revenues  of the Taurus, which passed along before his eyes, accrued to his rival, as also the offerings at Saint Orestes',  of which he was greatly desirous to reap the fruits. He even went so far as, on one occasion when Basil was riding along his own road, to seize his mules by the bridle and bar the passage with a robber band. And with how specious a pretext, the care of his spiritual children and of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> entrusted to him, and the defence of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash; pretexts which veiled that most common <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, insatiable <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>&mdash; and further, the wrongfulness of paying dues to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> being any one who had displeased him.</p>

<p>59. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man of God however, metropolitan as he was of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Jerusalem above, was neither carried away with the failure of those who fell, nor allowed himself to overlook this conduct, nor did he desire any inadequate remedy for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Let us see how great and wonderful it was, or, I would say, how worthy of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. He made of the dissension a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of increase to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the disaster, under his most able management, resulted in the multiplication of the Bishops of the country. From this ensued three most desirable consequences; a greater care for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, the management by each city of its own affairs, and the cessation of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in this quarter. I am afraid that I myself was treated as an appendage to this scheme. By no other term can I readily describe the position. Greatly as I admire his whole conduct, to an extent indeed beyond my powers of expression, of this single particular I find it impossible to approve, for I will acknowledge my feelings in regard to it, though these are from other sources not unknown to most of you. I mean the change and faithlessness of his treatment of myself, a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of pain which even time has not obliterated. For this is the source of all the inconsistency and tangle of my life; it has <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> me of the practice, or at least the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; of small moment though the latter be. The defence, which you will perhaps allow me to make for him, is this; his ideas were superhuman, and having, before his death, become superior to worldly influences, his only interests were those of the Spirit: while his regard for friendship was in no wise lessened by his readiness then, and then only, to disregard its claims, when they were in conflict with his paramount duty to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and when the end he had in view was of greater importance than the interests he was compelled to set aside.</p>

<p>60. I am afraid that, in avoiding the imputation of indifference at the hands of those who desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all that can be said about him, I shall incur a charge of prolixity from those whose ideal is the golden mean. For the latter Basil himself had the greatest respect, being specially devoted to the adage <q>In all things the mean  is the best,</q> and acting upon it throughout his life. Nevertheless, disregarding alike those who desire undue conciseness or excessive prolixity, I proceed thus with my speech. Different men attain success in different ways, some applying themselves to one alone of the many forms of excellence, but no one, of those hitherto <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me, arriving at the highest eminence in all respects; he being in my opinion the best, who has won his laurels on the widest field, or gained the highest possible renown in some single particular. Such however was the height of Basil's fame, that he became the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> kind. Let us consider the matter thus. Is any one devoted to poverty and a life devoid of property, and free from superfluity? What did he possess besides his body, and the necessary coverings of the flesh? His <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> was the having nothing, and he thought the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, with which he lived, more precious than great riches. For no one, however much he may wish, can obtain possession of all things, but any one can learn to despise, and so prove himself superior to, all things. Such being his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and such his life, he had no need of an altar and of vainglory, nor of such a public announcement as <q>Crates  sets Crates the Theban free.</q> For his aim was ever to be, not to seem, most excellent. Nor did he dwell in a tub,  and in the midst of the market-place, and so by luxuriating in publicity turn his poverty into riches: but was poor and unkempt, yet without ostentation: and taking cheerfully the casting overboard of all that he ever had, sailed lightly across the sea of life.</p>

<p>61. A wondrous thing is <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and fewness of wants, and freedom from the dominion of pleasures, and from the bondage of that cruel and degrading mistress, the belly. Who was so independent of food, and, without exaggeration, more free from the flesh? For he flung away all satiety and surfeit to creatures destitute of reason, whose life is slavish and debasing. He paid little attention to such things as, next to the appetite, are of equal rank, but, as far as possible, lived on the merest necessaries, his only luxury being to prove himself not luxurious, and not, in consequence, to have greater needs: but he looked to the lilies and the birds, <span class="stiki" id="note314507"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;6:26</a></span> whose beauty is artless, and their food casual, according to the important advice of my Christ, who made Himself poor <span class="stiki" id="note314508"><a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:9</a></span> in the flesh for our sakes, that we might enjoy the riches of His Godhead. Hence came his single coat and well worn cloak, and his bed on the bare ground, his <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>, his unwashedness (such were his decorations) and his most sweet food and relish, bread, and <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, his new dainty, and the sober and plentiful drink, with which fountains supply those who are free from trouble. The result, or the accompaniment, of these things were the attendance on the sick and practice of medicine, our common intellectual pursuit. For, though inferior to him in all other respects, I must needs be his equal in distress.</p>

<p>62. A great thing is <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and celibacy, and being ranked with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and with the single nature; for I shrink from calling it Christ's, Who, though He willed to be born for our sakes who are born, by being born of a Virgin, enacted  the law of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, to lead us away from this life, and cut short the power of the world, or rather, to transmit one world to another, the present to the future. Who then paid more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, or had more control of the flesh, not only by his personal example, but in those under his care? Whose are the convents, and the written regulations, by which he subdued every sense, and regulated every member, and won to the real practice of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, turning inward the view of beauty, from the visible to the invisible; and by wasting away the external, and withdrawing fuel from the flame, and revealing the secrets of the heart to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is the only bridegroom of pure <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and takes in with himself the watchful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, if they go to meet him with lamps burning and a plentiful supply of oil? <span class="stiki" id="note314510"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;25:2</a></span> Moreover he reconciled most excellently and united the solitary and the community life. These had been in many respects at variance and dissension, while neither of them was in absolute and unalloyed possession of good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: the one being more calm and settled, tending to union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet not free from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, inasmuch as its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> lies beyond the means of testing or comparison; the other, which is of more practical service, being not free from the tendency to turbulence. He founded cells  for <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetics</a> and hermits, but at no great distance from his cenobitic communities, and, instead of distinguishing and separating the one from the other, as if by some intervening wall, he brought them together and united them, in order that the contemplative spirit might not be cut off from society, nor the active life be uninfluenced by the contemplative, but that, like sea and land, by an interchange of their several gifts, they might unite in promoting the one object, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>63. What more? A noble thing is philanthropy, and the support of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and the assistance of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness. Go forth a little way from the city, and behold the new city,  the storehouse of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, the common treasury of the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>, in which the superfluities of their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, aye, and even their necessaries, are stored, in consequence of his exhortations, freed from the power of the moth, <span class="stiki" id="note314513"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;6:19</a></span> no longer gladdening the eyes of the thief, and escaping both the emulation of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and the corruption of time: where disease is regarded in a religious light, and disaster is thought a blessing, and sympathy is put to the test. Why should I compare with this work Thebes  of the seen portals, and the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Thebes, and the walls of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and the Carian tomb of Mausolus, and the Pyramids, and the bronze without weight of the Colossus, or the size and beauty of shrines that are no more, and all the other objects of men's wonder, and historic record, from which their founders gained no advantage, except a slight meed of fame. My subject is the most wonderful of all, the short road to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, the easiest ascent to heaven. There is no longer before our eyes that terrible and piteous spectacle of men who are living corpses, the greater part of whose limbs have mortified, driven away from their cities and homes and public places and fountains, aye, and from their own dearest ones, recognizable by their names rather than by their features: they are no longer brought before us at our gatherings and meetings, in our common intercourse and union, no longer the objects of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, instead of pity on account of their disease; composers of piteous songs, if any of them have their voice still left to them. Why should I try to express in tragic style all our experiences, when no language can be adequate to their hard lot? He however it was, who took the lead in pressing upon those who were men, that they ought not to despise their fellowmen, nor to dishonour Christ, the one Head of all, by their inhuman treatment of them; but to use the misfortunes of others as an opportunity of firmly establishing their own lot, and to lend to God that mercy of which they stand in need at His hands. He did not therefore disdain to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> with his lips this disease, noble and of noble ancestry and brilliant <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> though he was, but saluted them as brethren, not, as some might suppose, from vainglory, (for who was so far removed from this feeling?) but taking the lead in approaching to tend them, as a consequence of his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and so giving not only a speaking, but also a silent, instruction. The effect produced is to be seen not only in the city, but in the country and beyond, and even the leaders of society have vied with one another in their philanthropy and magnanimity towards them. Others have had their cooks, and splendid tables, and the devices and dainties of confectioners, and exquisite carriages, and soft, flowing robes; Basil's care was for the sick, and the relief of their wounds, and the imitation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by cleansing <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, not by a word, but in deed.</p>

<p>64. As to all this, what will be said by those who charge him with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and haughtiness? Severe critics they are of such conduct, applying to him, whose life was a standard, those who were not standards at all. Is it possible that he who kissed the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, and humiliated himself to such a degree, could treat haughtily those who were in health: and, while wasting his flesh by abstinence, puff out his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with empty arrogance? Is it possible to condemn the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, and expound the debasing effect of haughtiness, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who condescended to the form of a slave, and ate with <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>, and washed the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples'</a> feet, and did not disdain the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, in order to nail my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to it: and, more incredible still, to see God crucified, aye, along with <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> also, and derided by the passers by, impassible, and beyond the reach of suffering as He is; and yet, as his slanderers <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, soar himself above the clouds, and think that nothing can be on an equality with him. Nay, what they term <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is, I fancy, the firmness and steadfastness and stability of his character. Such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> would readily, it seems to me, call <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> rashness, and the circumspect a coward, and the temperate misanthropic, and the just illiberal. For indeed this <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> axiom is excellent, which says that the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>  are settled close to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and are, in some sense, their next-door neighbours: and it is most easy, for those whose training in such subjects has been defective, to mistake a man for what he is not. For who honoured <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and castigated <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> more than he, or showed himself more kind to the upright, more severe to the wrong doers? His very smile often amounted to praise, his silence to rebuke, racking the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the secret <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. And if a man have not been a chatterer, and jester, and gossip, nor a general favourite, because of having pleased others by becoming all things to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314516"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:22</a></span> what of that? Is he not in the eyes of sensible men worthy of praise rather than of blame? Unless it is a fault in the lion that he is terrible and royal, and does not look like an ape, and that his spring is noble, and is valued for its wonderfulness: while stage-players ought to win our admiration for their pleasant and philanthropic characters, because they please the vulgar, and raise a laugh by their sounding slaps in the face. And if this indeed be our object, who was so pleasant when you met him, as I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, who have had the longest experience? Who was more kindly in his stories, more refined in his wit, more tender in his rebukes? His reproofs gave rise to no arrogance, his relaxation to no dissipation, but avoiding excess in either, he made use of both in reason and season, according to the rules of Solomon, who assigns to every business a season. <span class="stiki" id="note314517"><a href="../bible/ecc003.htm#verse1">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;3:1</a></span> </p>

<p>65. But what are these to his renown for eloquence, and his powers of instruction, which have won the favour of the ends of the world? As yet we have been compassing the foot of the mountain, to the neglect of its summit, as yet we have been crossing a strait, paying no heed to the mighty and deep ocean. For I think that if any one ever has become, or can become, a trumpet, in his far sounding resonance, or a voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, embracing the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, or an earthquake of the world, by some unheard of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, it is his voice and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which deserve these titles, for surpassing and excelling all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as much as we surpass the irrational creatures. Who, more than he, cleansed himself by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and made himself worthy to set forth divine things? Who was more enlightened by the light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and had a closer insight into the depths of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and by the aid of God beheld the things of God? Whose language could better express intellectual <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, without, as most men do, limping on one foot, by either failing to express his ideas, or allowing his eloquence to outstrip his reasoning powers? In both respects he won a like distinction, and showed himself to be his own equal, and absolutely perfect. To search all things, yea, the deep things of God <span class="stiki" id="note314518"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:10</a></span> is, according to the testimony of S. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the office of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, not because He is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of them, but because He takes delight in their <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Now all the things of the Spirit Basil had fully investigated, and hence he drew his instructions for every kind of character, his lessons in the sublime, and his exhortations to quit things present, and adapt ourselves to things to come.</p>

<p>66. The sun is extolled by David for its beauty, its greatness, its swift course, and its power, splendid as a bridegroom, majestic as a giant;  while, from the extent of its circuit, it has such power that it equally sheds its light from one end of heaven to the other, and the heat thereof is in no wise lessened by distance. Basil's beauty was <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, his greatness theology, his course the perpetual motion reaching even to God by its ascents, and his power the sowing and distribution of the Word. So that I will not hesitate to say even this, his utterance went out into all lands,  and the power of his words to the ends of the world: as S. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says of the Apostles, <span class="stiki" id="note314521"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;10:18</a></span> borrowing the words from David. What other charm is there in any gathering today? What pleasure in banquets, in the courts, in the churches? What delight in those in authority, and those beneath them? What in the hermits, or the cenobites? What in the leisured classes, or those busied in affairs? What in profane schools of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> or in our own? There is one, which runs through all, and is the greatest&mdash; his writings and labours. Nor do writers require any supply of matter besides his teaching or writings. All the laborious studies of old days in the Divine oracles are silent, while the new ones are in everybody's mouth, and he is the best teacher among us who has the deepest acquaintance with his works, and speaks of them and explains them in our ears. For he alone more than supplies the place of all others to those who are specially eager for instruction.</p>

<p>67. I will only say this of him. Whenever I handle his Hexaemeron, and take its words on my lips, I am brought into the presence of the Creator, and understand the words of creation, and admire the Creator more than before, using my teacher as my only means of sight. Whenever I take up his polemical works, I see the fire of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314522"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;19:24</a></span> by which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and rebellious tongues are reduced to ashes, or the tower of Chalane,  impiously built, <span class="stiki" id="note314524"><a href="../bible/gen011.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;11:4</a></span> and righteously destroyed. Whenever I read his writings on the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, I find the God Whom I possess, and grow bold in my utterance of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, from the support of his theology and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. His other treatises, in which he gives explanations for those who are shortsighted, by a threefold inscription on the solid tablets of his heart, lead me on from a mere literal or <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> interpretation to a still wider view, as I proceed from one depth to another, calling upon deep  after deep, and finding light after light, until I attain the highest pinnacle. When I study his panegyrics on our athletes, I despise the body, and enjoy the society of those whom he is praising, and rouse myself to the struggle. His moral and practical discourses purify <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, making me a temple fit for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and an instrument struck by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, to celebrate by its strains the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In fact, he reduces me to harmony and order, and changes me by a Divine transformation.</p>

<p>68. Since I have mentioned theology, and his most sublime treatises in this science, I will make this addition to what I have already said. For it is of great service to the community, to save them from being injured by an unjustifiably low opinion of him. My remarks are directed against those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> disposed <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who shelter their own <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> under cover of their <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against others. In his defence of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> teaching, and of the union and coequal divinity of the Holy Trinity, to use terms which are, I think, as exact and clear as possible, he would have eagerly welcomed as a gain, and not a danger, not only expulsion from his see, in which he had originally no desire to be enthroned, but even exile, and death, and its preliminary tortures. This is manifest from his actual conduct and sufferings. For when he had been sentenced to banishment on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the only notice which he took of it was, to bid one of his servants to take his writing tablet and follow him. He held it necessary, according to the divine David's advice, to guide his words with discretion,  and to endure for a while the time of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and the ascendency of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, until it should be succeeded by a time of freedom and calm, which would admit of freedom of speech. The enemy were on the watch for the unqualified statement <q>the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> which, although it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, they and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> patron of their impiety imagined to be impious; so that they might banish him and his power of theological instruction from the city, and themselves be able to seize upon the church, and make it the starting point and citadel, from which they could overrun with their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doctrine the rest of the world. Accordingly, by the use of other terms, and by statements which unmistakably had the same meaning, and by arguments necessarily leading to this conclusion, he so overpowered his antagonists, that they were left without reply, and involved in their own admissions,&mdash; the greatest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> possible of dialectical power and skill. His treatise on this subject makes it further manifest, being evidently written by a pen borrowed from the Spirit's store. He postponed for the time the use of the exact term, begging as a favour from the Spirit Himself and his earnest champions, that they would not be annoyed at his economy,  nor, by clinging to a single expression, ruin the whole <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, from an uncompromising temper, at a crisis when religion was in peril. He assured them that they would suffer no injury from a slight change in their expressions, and from teaching the same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in other terms. For our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is not so much a matter of words as of actions; for we would not reject the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, if they desired to unite with us, and yet for a while sought to use the term <q>Anointed</q> instead of <q>Christ:</q> while the community would suffer a very serious injury, if the church were seized upon by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<p>69. That he, no less than any other, acknowledged that the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is plain from his often having publicly preached this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whenever opportunity offered, and eagerly confessed it when questioned in private. But he made it more clear in his conversations with me, from whom he concealed nothing during our conferences upon this subject. Not content with simply asserting it, he proceeded, as he had but very seldom done before, to imprecate upon himself that most terrible <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of separation from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, if he did not adore the Spirit as consubstantial and coequal with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. And if any one would accept me as having been his fellow labourer in this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, I will set forth one point hitherto unknown to most men. Under the pressure of the difficulties of the period, he himself undertook the economy, while allowing freedom of speech to me, whom no one was likely to drag from obscurity to trial or banishment, in order that by our united efforts our <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> might be firmly established. I mention this, not to defend his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, for the man is stronger than his assailants, if there are any such; but to prevent men from thinking that the terms found in his writings are the utmost limit of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and so have their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> weakened, and consider that their own <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is supported by his theology, which was the joint result of the influences of the time and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, instead of considering the sense of his writings, and the object with which they were written, so as to be brought closer to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and enabled to silence the partisans of impiety. At any rate let his theology be mine, and that of all dear to me! And so confident am I of his spotlessness in this respect, that I take him for my partner in this, as in all else: and may what is mine be attributed to him, what is his to me, both at the hands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of the wisest of men! For we would not say that the Evangelists are at variance with one another, because some are more occupied with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> side of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and others pay attention to His Divinity; some having commenced their history with what is within our own experience, others with what is above us; and by thus sharing the substance of their message, they have procured the advantage of those who receive it, and followed the impressions of the Spirit Who was within them.</p>

<p>70. Come then, there have been many men of old days illustrious for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, as lawgivers, generals, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, teachers, and men brave to the shedding of blood. Let us compare our prelate with them, and thus recognize his merit. <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was honoured by the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314528"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse27">Genesis&nbsp;1:27</a></span> and the delights of Paradise,  and the first legislation:  but, unless I <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of our first parent, he kept not the command. Now Basil both received and observed it, and received no injury from the tree of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and escaped the flaming sword, and, as I am well assured, has attained to Paradise. Enos first ventured to call upon the Lord.  Basil both called upon Him himself, and, what is far more excellent, preached Him to others. <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> was translated,  attaining to his translation as the reward of a little <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> (for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was still in shadow) and escaped the peril of the remainder of life, but Basil's whole life was a translation, and he was completely tested in a complete life. <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> was entrusted with the ark, <span class="stiki" id="note314533"><a href="../bible/gen006.htm#verse13">Genesis&nbsp;6:13</a></span> and the seeds of a new world committed to a small house of wood, in their preservation from the waters. Basil escaped the deluge of impiety and made of his own city an ark of safety, which sailed lightly over the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and afterwards recovered the whole world.</p>

<p>71. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was a great man, a patriarch, the offerer of the new <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>,  by presenting to Him who had given it the promised seed, as a ready offering, eager for slaughter. But Basil's offering was no slight one, when he offered himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without any equivalent being given in his stead, (for how could that have been possible?) so that his <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> was consummated. Isaac was promised even before his birth,  Basil promised himself, and took for his spouse Rebekah, I mean the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not fetched from a distance by the mission of a servant,  but bestowed upon and entrusted to him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> close at home: nor was he outwitted in the preference of his children, but bestowed upon each what was due to him, without any deception, according to the judgment of the Spirit. I extol the ladder of Jacob,  and the pillar which he anointed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and his wrestling with Him, whatever it was; and, in my opinion, it was the contrast and opposition of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> stature to the height of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, resulting in the tokens of the defeat  of his race. I extol also his clever devices and success in cattle-breeding, and his children, the twelve Patriarchs, and the distribution of his blessings, with their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of the future. But I still more extol Basil for the ladder which he did not merely see, but which he ascended by successive steps towards excellence, and the pillar which he did not anoint, but which he erected to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by pillorying the teaching of the ungodly; and the wrestling with which he wrestled, not with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but, on behalf of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the overthrow of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; and his pastoral care, whereby he grew rich, through gaining for himself a number of marked sheep greater than that of the unmarked, and his illustrious fruitfulness in spiritual children, and the blessing with which he established many.</p>

<p>72. Joseph was a provider of grain, <span class="stiki" id="note314539"><a href="../bible/gen041.htm#verse40">Genesis&nbsp;41:40</a></span> but in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> only, and not frequently, and of bodily food. Basil did so for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and at all times, and in spiritual food, and therefore, in my opinion, his was the more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> function. Like Job, the man of Uz, <span class="stiki" id="note314540"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse1">Job&nbsp;1:1</a></span> he was both tempted, and overcame, and at the close of his struggles gained splendid <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, having been shaken by none of his many assailants, and having gained a decisive victory over the efforts of the tempter, and put to silence the unreason of his friends, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> character of his affliction. <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> among His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</q>  Truly was <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> great, who inflicted the plagues upon <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>,  and delivered the people among many signs and wonders, and entered within the cloud, and sanctioned the double law, outward in the letter, and inward in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>. <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> was <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> brother,  both naturally and spiritually, and offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the people, as the hierophant of the great and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man. <span class="stiki" id="note314544"><a href="../bible/heb008.htm#verse2">Hebrews&nbsp;8:2</a></span> Of both of them Basil was a rival, for he tortured, not with bodily but with spiritual and mental plagues, the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> race of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and led to the land of promise  the people of possession, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> of good works; <span class="stiki" id="note314546"><a href="../bible/tit002.htm#verse14">Titus&nbsp;2:14</a></span> he inscribed <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, which are no longer obscure, but entirely spiritual, on tables <span class="stiki" id="note314547"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:3</a></span> which are not broken but are preserved; he entered the Holy of holies,  not once a year, but often, I may say every day, and thence he revealed to us the Holy Trinity; and cleansed the people, not with temporary sprinklings, but with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> purifications: What is the special excellence of Joshua? <span class="stiki" id="note314549"><a href="../bible/jos001.htm#verse2">Joshua&nbsp;1:2</a></span> His generalship, and the distribution of the inheritance, and the taking possession of the Holy Land. And was not Basil an Exarch?  Was he not a general of those who are saved by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note314551"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> Did he not assign the different inheritances and abodes, according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, among his followers? So that he too could use the words, The lot is fallen unto me in pleasant places;  and <q>my fortunes are in Your hands,</q>  fortunes more precious than those which come to us on earth, and can be snatched away.</p>

<p>73. Further, to run over the Judges, or the most illustrious of the Judges, there is <q>Samuel among those that call upon His Name,</q>  who was given to God before his birth, <span class="stiki" id="note314555"><a href="../bible/1sa001.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;1:20</a></span> and sanctified immediately after his birth, and the anointer with his horn of kings and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.  But was not Basil as an infant <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to God from the womb, and offered with a coat <span class="stiki" id="note314557"><a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;2:19</a></span> at the altar, and was he not a seer of heavenly things, and anointed of the Lord, and the anointer of those who are perfected by the Spirit? Among the kings, David is celebrated, whose victories and trophies <span class="stiki" id="note314558"><a href="../bible/2sa005.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;5:1</a></span> gained from the enemy are on record, but his most characteristic trait was his gentleness,  and, before his kingly office, his power with the harp, able to soothe even the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit. Solomon asked of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and obtained breadth of heart, <span class="stiki" id="note314560"><a href="../bible/1ki004.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;4:29</a></span> making the furthest possible progress in wisdom and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, so that he became the most famous man of his time. Basil, in my opinion, was in no wise, or but little inferior, to the one in gentleness, to the other in wisdom, so that he soothed the arrogance of infuriated sovereigns; and did not merely bring the queen of the south from the ends of the earth, or any other individual, to visit him because of his renown for wisdom, but made his wisdom <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in all the ends of the world. I pass over the rest of Solomon's life. Even if we spare it, it is evident to all.</p>

<p>74. Do you praise the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of Elijah <span class="stiki" id="note314561"><a href="../bible/2ki001.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;1:1</a></span> in the presence of tyrants, and his fiery translation?  Or the fair inheritance of Elisha, the sheepskin mantle, accompanied by the spirit of Elijah?  You must also praise the life of Basil, spent in the fire. I mean in the multitude of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, and his escape through fire, which burnt, but did not consume, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <q>the bush,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note314564"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;3:1</a></span> and the fair cloak of skin from on high, his indifference to the flesh. I pass by the rest, the three young men bedewed in the fire, <span class="stiki" id="note314565"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse5">Daniel&nbsp;3:5</a></span> the fugitive <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in the whale's belly, <span class="stiki" id="note314566"><a href="../bible/jon002.htm#verse1">Jonah&nbsp;2:1</a></span> and coming forth from the creature, as from a chamber; the just man in the den, restraining the lions' rage, <span class="stiki" id="note314567"><a href="../bible/dan006.htm#verse22">Daniel&nbsp;6:22</a></span> and the struggle of the seven Maccabees, <span class="stiki" id="note314568"><a href="../bible/2ma007.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;7:1</a></span> who were perfected with their father and mother in blood, and in all kinds of tortures. Their endurance he rivalled, and won their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<p>75. I now turn to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and comparing his life with those who are here illustrious, I shall find in the teachers a source of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. Who was the forerunner of Jesus? <span class="stiki" id="note314569"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse76">Luke&nbsp;1:76</a></span> John, the voice of the Word,  the lamp of the Light,  before Whom he even leaped in the womb, <span class="stiki" id="note314572"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;2:41</a></span> and Whom he preceded to Hades, whither he was dispatched by the rage of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314573"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;14:10</a></span> to herald even there Him who was coming. And, if my language seems audacious to anyone, let me assure him beforehand, that in making this comparison, I neither prefer Basil, nor imply that he is equal to him who surpasses all who are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314574"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;11:11</a></span> but only show that he was stirred to emulation, and possessed to some extent his striking features. For it is no slight thing for the earnest to imitate the greatest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, even in a slight degree. Is it not indeed manifest that Basil was a copy of John's <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a>? He also lived in the wilderness, and wore in nightly watchings a ragged garb, during his shrinking retirement; he also loved a similar food, purifying himself for God by abstinence; he also was thought worthy to be a herald, if not a forerunner, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and there went out to him not only all the region round about,  but also that which was beyond its borders; he also stood between the two covenants, abolishing the letter of the one by administering the spirit of the other, and bringing about the fulfilment of the hidden law through the dissolution of that which was apparent.</p>

<p>76. He emulated the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Peter, <span class="stiki" id="note314576"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse8">Acts&nbsp;4:8</a></span> the intensity of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of both these men of name and of surname, the lofty utterance of the sons of Zebedee, the frugality and simplicity of all the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Therefore he was also entrusted with the keys of the heavens, <span class="stiki" id="note314577"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;16:1</a></span> and not only from Jerusalem and round about unto <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314578"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;15:1</a></span> but he embraces a wider circle in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; he is not named, but becomes, a Son of thunder; and lying upon the breast of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, he draws thence the power of his word, and the depth of his thoughts. He was prevented from becoming a Stephen, <span class="stiki" id="note314579"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse58">Acts&nbsp;7:58</a></span> eager though he was, since reverence stayed the hands of those who would have <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> him. I am able to sum up still more concisely, to avoid treating in detail on these points of each individual. In some respects he discovered, in some he emulated, in others he surpassed the good. In his many-sided <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> he excelled all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of this day. I have but one thing left to say, and in few words.</p>

<p>77. So great was his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and the eminence of his fame, that many of his minor characteristics, nay, even his physical defects, have been assumed by others with a view to notoriety. For instance his paleness, his beard, his gait, his thoughtful, and generally meditative, hesitation in speaking, which, in the ill-judged, inconsiderate imitation of many, took the form of melancholy. And besides, the style of his dress, the shape of his bed, and his manner of eating, none of which was to him a matter of consequence, but simply the result of accident and chance. So you might see many Basils in outward semblance, among these <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> in outline, for it would be too much to call them his distant echo. For an echo, though it is the dying away of a sound, at any rate represents it with great clearness, while these men fall too far short of him to satisfy even their desire to approach him. Nor was it a slight thing, but a matter with good reason held in the highest estimation, to chance to have met him or done him some service, or to carry away the souvenir of something which he had said or done in jest or in earnest: as I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I have myself often taken <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in doing; for his improvisations were much more precious and brilliant than the laboured efforts of other men.</p>

<p>78. But when, after he had finished his course, and kept the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314580"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:7</a></span> he longed to depart, and the time for his crown was approaching, <span class="stiki" id="note314581"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse23">Philippians&nbsp;1:23</a></span> he did not hear the summons: <q>Get you up into the mountain and die,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note314582"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse49">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:49</a></span> but <q>Die and come up to us.</q> And here again he wrought a wonder in no wise inferior to those mentioned before. For when he was almost dead, and breathless, and had lost the greater part of his powers; he grew stronger in his last words, so as to depart with the utterances of religion, and, by ordaining the most excellent of his attendants, bestowed upon them both his hand and the Spirit: so that his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who had aided him in his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office, might not be defrauded of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. The remainder of my task I approach, but with reluctance, as it would fall more fully from the mouths of others than from my own. For I cannot philosophise over my misfortune, even if I greatly longed to do so, when I recollect that the loss is common to us all, and that the misfortune has befallen the whole world.</p>

<p>79. He lay, drawing his last breath, and awaited by the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> on high, towards which he had long directed his gaze. Around him poured the whole city, unable to bear his loss, inveighing against his departure, as if it had been an oppression, and clinging to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as though it had been capable of restraint or compulsion at their hands or their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Their suffering had driven them distracted, all were eager, were it possible, to add to his life a portion of their own. And when they failed, for it must needs be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that he was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and, with his last words <q>Into your Hands I commend my spirit,</q>  he had joyfully resigned his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the care of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who carried him away; not without having some religious instructions and injunctions for the benefit of those who were present&mdash; then occurred a wonder more remarkable than any which had happened before.</p>

<p>80. The saint was being carried out, lifted high by the hands of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, and everyone was eager, some to seize the hem of his garment, <span class="stiki" id="note314584"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse44">Luke&nbsp;8:44</a></span> others only just to touch the shadow, <span class="stiki" id="note314585"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;5:15</a></span> or the bier which bore his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> remains (for what could be more <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> or pure than that body), others to draw near to those who were carrying it, others only to enjoy the sight, as if even this were beneficial. Market places, porticos, houses of two or three stories were filled with people escorting, preceding, following, accompanying him, and trampling upon each other; tens of thousands of every race and age, beyond all previous experience. The psalmody was overborne by the lamentations, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> resignation sank beneath the misfortune. Our own people vied with strangers, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, Greeks, and foreigners, and they with us, for a greater share in the benefit, by means of a more abundant lamentation. To close my story, the calamity ended in danger; many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> departed along with him, from the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the pushing and confusion, who have been thought <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in their end, departing together with him, <q>funeral victims,</q> perhaps some fervid orator might call them. The body having at last escaped from those who would seize it, and made its way through those who went before it, was consigned to the tomb of his fathers, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> being added to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the mighty voice which rings in my ears to the heralds, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. And now he is in heaven, where, if I mistake not, he is offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for us, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the people, for though, he has left us, he has not entirely left us. While I, Gregory, who am half dead, and, cleft in two, torn away from our great union, and dragging along a life of pain which runs not easily, as may be supposed, after separation from him, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what is to be my end now that I have lost my guidance. And even now I am admonished and instructed in nightly visions, if ever I fall short of my duty. And my present object is not so much to mingle lamentations with my praises, or to portray the public life of the man, or publish a picture of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> common to all time, and an example salutary to all churches, and to all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which we may keep in view, as a living law, and so rightly direct our lives as to counsel you, who have been completely initiated into his doctrine, to fix your eyes upon him, as one who sees you and is seen by you, and thus to be perfected by the Spirit.</p>

<p>81. Come hither then, and surround me, all you members of his <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a>, both of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, both of our own country and from abroad; aid me in my eulogy, by each supplying or demanding the account of some of his excellences. Regard, you occupants of the bench, the lawgiver; ye politicians, the statesman; ye men of the people, his orderliness; ye men of letters, the instructor; ye <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, the leader of the bride; ye who are yoked in marriage, the restrainer; ye hermits, him who gave you wings; ye cenobites, the judge; ye simple men, the guide; ye contemplatives, the divine; ye cheerful ones, the bridle; ye unfortunate men, the consoler, the staff of hoar hairs, the guide of youth, the relief of poverty, the steward of abundance. Widows also will, I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, praise their protector, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> their father, poor men their friend, strangers their entertainer, brothers the man of brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the sick their physician, whatever be their sickness and the healing they need, the healthy the preserver of health, and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> him who made himself all things to all that he might gain the majority, if not all.</p>

<p>82. This is my offering to you, Basil, uttered by the tongue which once was the sweetest of all to you, of him who was your fellow in age and rank. If it have approached your deserts, thanks are due to you, for it was from confidence in you that I undertook to speak of you. But if it fall far short of your expectations, what must be our feelings, who are worn out with age and disease and regret for you? Yet God is pleased, when we do what we can. Yet may thou gaze upon us from above, thou divine and sacred person; either stay by your entreaties our thorn in the flesh, <span class="stiki" id="note314586"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:7</a></span> given to us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for our discipline, or prevail upon us to bear it boldly, and guide all our life towards that which is most for our profit. And if we be translated, do thou receive us there also in your own tabernacle, that, as we dwell together, and gaze together more clearly and more perfectly upon the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed Trinity, of Which we have now in some degree received the image, our longing may at last be satisfied, by gaining this recompense for all the battles we have fought and the assaults we have endured. Such are our words on your behalf: who will there be to praise us, since we leave this life after you, even if we offer any topic worthy of words or praise in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, to Whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> forever? <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
