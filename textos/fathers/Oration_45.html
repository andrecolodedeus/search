<h1>Oration 45</h1>

<p><strong>The Second Oration on Easter.</strong></p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>This Oration was not, as its title would perhaps lead us to suppose, delivered immediately after the first; but an interval of many years elapsed between them, and the two have no connection with each other. Chronologically they are the first and last of S. Gregory's Sermons. The Second was delivered in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Arianzus, a village near Nazianzus, where he had inherited some property, to which he withdrew after resigning the Archbishopric of Constantinople, and then, finding the administration even of the little Bishopric of Nazianzus too much for his advancing years and declining strength, he retired to Arianzus about the end of A.D. 383, dying there in 389 or 390. <q>The exordium of this discourse is quite in the style of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>; the Orator here describes and puts words into the mouth of the Angel of the Resurrection. His object is to show the importance of the day's solemnities, and to explain allegorically all the circumstances of the ancient <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, applying them to Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life. Two passages are borrowed verbatim from the discourse on the Nativity, preached at Constantinople</q> (Beno&icirc;t).</p>

<p>The Benedictine Editors profess themselves unable to determine whether this repetition is due to S. Gregory himself&mdash; or to the carelessness of some amanuensis.</p>
</div>

<p>I. I will stand upon my watch, <span class="stiki" id="note314587"><a href="../bible/hab002.htm#verse1">Habakkuk&nbsp;2:1</a></span> says the venerable Habakkuk; and I will take my post beside him today on the authority and observation which was given me of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; and I will look forth, and will observe what shall be said to me. Well, I have taken my stand, and looked forth; and behold a man riding on the clouds and he is very high, and his countenance is as the countenance of Angel, <span class="stiki" id="note314588"><a href="../bible/jdg013.htm#verse6">Judges&nbsp;13:6</a></span> and his vesture as the brightness of piercing lightning; and he lifts his hand toward the East, and cries with a loud voice. His voice is like the voice of a trumpet; and round about Him is as it were a multitude of the Heavenly Host; and he says, Today is <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> come unto the world, to that which is visible, and to that which is invisible. Christ is risen from the dead, rise ye with Him. Christ is returned again to Himself, return ye. Christ is freed from the tomb, be ye freed from the bond of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> are opened, and death is destroyed, and the old <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is put aside, and the New is fulfilled; if any man be in Christ he is a new creature; <span class="stiki" id="note314589"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> be ye renewed. Thus he speaks; and the rest sing out, as they did before when Christ was manifested to us by His birth on earth, their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest, on earth, peace, goodwill among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.  And with them I also utter the same words among you. And would that I might receive a voice that should rank with the Angel's, and should sound through all the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>II. The Lord's <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, and again I say the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Trinity. This is to us a Feast of feasts and a Solemnity of solemnities  as far exalted above all others (not only those which are merely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and creep on the ground, but even those which are of Christ Himself, and are celebrated in His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>) as the Sun is above the stars. Beautiful indeed yesterday was our splendid array, and our illumination, in which both in public and private we associated ourselves, every kind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and almost every rank, illuminating the night with our crowded fires, formed after the fashion of that great light, both that with which the heaven above us lights its beacon fires, and that which is above the heavens, amid the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (the first luminous nature, next to the first nature of all, because springing directly from it), and that which is in the Trinity, from which all light derives its being, parted from the undivided light and honoured. But today's is more beautiful and more illustrious; inasmuch as yesterday's light was a forerunner of the rising of the Great Light, and as it were a kind of rejoicing in preparation for the Festival; but today we are celebrating the Resurrection itself, no longer as an object of expectation, but as having already come to pass, and gathering the whole world unto itself. Let then different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> bring forth different fruits and offer different offerings at this season, smaller or greater...such spiritual offerings as are dear to God...as each may have power. For scarcely Angels themselves could offer gifts worthy of its rank, those first and intellectual and pure beings, who are also eye-witnesses of the Glory That is on high; if even these can attain the full strain of praise. We will for our part offer a discourse, the best and most precious thing we have&mdash; especially as we are praising the Word for the blessing which He has bestowed on the reasoning creation. I will begin from this point. For I cannot endure, when I am engaged in offering the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the lips concerning the Great Sacrifice and the greatest of days, to fail to recur to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to take my beginning from Him. Therefore I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, cleanse your mind and ears and thoughts, all you who delight in such subjects, since the discourse will be concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and will be divine; that you may depart filled with delights of a sort that do not pass away into nothingness. And it shall be at once very full and very concise, so as neither to distress you by its deficiencies, nor to displease you by satiety.</p>

<p>III. God  always was and always is, and always will be; or rather, God always Is.  For Was and Will Be are fragments of our time, and of changeable nature. But He is Eternal Being; and this is the Name He gives Himself when giving the Oracles to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the Mount. For in Himself He sums up and contains all Being, having neither beginning in the past nor end in the future...like some great Sea of Being, limitless and unbounded, transcending all conception of time and nature, only adumbrated by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and that very dimly and scantily...not by His Essentials but by His Environment,  one image being got from one source and another from another, and combined into some sort of presentation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which escapes us before we have caught it, and which takes to flight before we have conceived it, blazing forth upon our master-part, even when that is cleansed, as the lightning flash which will not stay its course does upon our sight...in order, as I conceive, by that part of it which we can comprehend to draw us to itself (for that which is altogether incomprehensible is outside the bounds of hope, and not within the compass of endeavour); and by that part of It which we cannot comprehend to move our wonder; and as an object of wonder to become more an object of desire; and being desired, to purify; and purifying to make us like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so that, when we have become like Himself, God may, to use a bold expression, hold converse with us as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; being united to us, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by us; and that perhaps to the same extent as He already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> those who are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to Him.  The Divine Nature, then, is boundless and hard to understand, and all that we can comprehend of Him is His boundlessness; even though one may conceive that because He is of a simple Nature He is therefore either wholly incomprehensible or perfectly comprehensible. For let us farther enquire what is implied by <q>is of a simple Nature?</q> For it is quite certain that this simplicity is not itself its nature, just as composition is not by itself the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of compound beings.</p>

<p>IV. And when Infinity is considered from two points of view, beginning and end (for that which is beyond these and not limited by them is Infinity), when the mind looks into the depths above, not having where to stand, and leans upon ph&aelig;nomena to form an idea of God it calls the Infinite and Unapproachable which it finds there by the name of Unoriginate. And when it looks into the depth below and at the future, it calls Him Undying and Imperishable. And when it draws a conclusion from the whole, it calls Him Eternal. For Eternity is neither time nor part of time; for it cannot be measured. But what time measured by the course of the sun is to us, that Eternity is to the Everlasting; namely a sort of timelike movement and interval, coextensive with Their Existence. This however is all that I must now say of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for the present is not a suitable time, as my present subject is not the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that of the Incarnation. And when I say <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I mean Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; for Godhead is neither diffused beyond These, so as to introduce a mob of gods, nor yet bounded by a smaller compass than These, so as to condemn us for a poverty stricken conception of Deity, either Judaizing to save the Monarchia, or falling into <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> by the multitude of our gods. For the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> on either side is the same, though found in contrary directions. Thus then is the Holy of Holies, Which is hidden even from the Seraphim, and is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> with a thrice-repeated Holy meeting in one ascription of the title Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as one of our predecessors has most beautifully and loftily reasoned out.</p>

<p>V. But since this movement of Self-<a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> alone could not satisfy Goodness, but Good must be poured out and go forth beyond Itself, to multiply the objects of Its beneficence (for this was essential to the highest Goodness), He first conceived the Angelic and Heavenly Powers. And this conception was a work fulfilled by His Word and perfected by His Spirit. And so the Secondary Splendours came into being, as the ministers of the Primary Splendour (whether we are to conceive of them as intelligent Spirits, or as Fire of an immaterial and incorporeal kind, or as some other nature approaching this as near as may be). I should like to say that they are incapable of movement in the direction of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and susceptible only of the movement of good, as being about God and illuminated with the first Rays from God (for earthly beings have but the second illumination), but I am <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to stop short of saying that they are immovable, and to conceive and speak of them as only difficult to move, because of him who for His Splendour was called Lucifer, but became and is called Darkness through his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; and the Apostate Hosts who are subject to him, creators of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by their revolt against good, and our inciters.</p>

<p>VI. Thus then and for these reasons, He gave being to the world of thought, as far as I can reason on these matters, and estimate great things in my own poor language. Then, when His first Creation was in good order, He conceives a second world, material and visible; and this a system of earth and sky and all that is in the midst of them; an admirable creation indeed when we look at the fair form of every part, but yet more worthy of admiration when we consider the harmony and unison of the whole, and how each part fits in with every other in fair order, and all with the whole, tending to the perfect completion of the world as a Unit. This was to show that He could call into being not only a nature akin to Himself, but also one altogether alien to Him. For akin to Deity are those natures which are intellectual, and only to be comprehended by mind; but all of which sense can take cognizance are utterly alien to It; and of these the furthest removed from it are all those which are entirely destitute of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and power of motion.</p>

<p>VII. Mind then and sense, thus distinguished from each other, had remained within their own boundaries, and bore in themselves the magnificence of the Creator-Word, silent praisers and thrilling heralds of His mighty work. Not yet was there any mingling of both, nor any mixture of these opposites, tokens of a greater wisdom and generosity in the creation of natures; nor as yet were the whole riches of goodness made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Now the Creator-Word, determining to exhibit this, and to produce a single living being out of both (the invisible and the visible creation, I mean) fashions Man; and taking a body from already existing matter, and placing in it a Breath taken from Himself (which the Word <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be an intelligent <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the image of God), as a sort of second world, great in littleness, He placed him on the earth, a new Angel, a mingled worshipper, fully initiated into the visible creation, but only partially into the intellectual; king of all upon earth, but subject to the King above; earthly and heavenly; temporal and yet <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; visible and yet intellectual; halfway between greatness and lowliness; in one person combining spirit and flesh; spirit because of the favour bestowed on him, flesh on account of the height to which he had been raised; the one that he might continue to live and glorify his benefactor, the other that he might suffer, and by suffering be put in remembrance, and be corrected if he became <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> in his greatness; a living creature, trained here and then moved elsewhere; and to complete the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, deified by its inclination to God...for to this, I think, tends that light of Truth which here we possess but in measure; that we should both see and experience the Splendour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is worthy of Him Who made us, and will dissolve us, and remake us after a loftier fashion.</p>

<p>VIII. This being He placed in paradise&mdash; whatever that paradise may have been (having honoured him with the gift of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, in order that good might belong to him as the result of his choice, no less than to Him Who had implanted the seeds of it)&mdash; to till the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> plants, by which is perhaps meant the Divine conceptions, both the simpler and the more perfect; naked in his simplicity and inartificial life; and without any covering or screen; for it was fitting that he who was from the beginning should be such. And He gave Him a Law, as material for his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> to act upon. This Law was a commandment as to what plants he might partake of, and which one he might not touch. This latter was the Tree of Knowledge; not, however, because it was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from the beginning when planted; nor was it forbidden because God grudged it to men&mdash; let not the enemies of God wag their tongues in that direction, or imitate the serpent. But it would have been good if partaken of at the proper time; for the Tree was, according to my theory, Contemplation, which it is only safe for those who have reached maturity of habit to enter upon; but which is not good for those who are still somewhat simple and greedy; just as neither is solid food good for those who are yet tender and have need of milk. But when through the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> caprice, <span class="stiki" id="note314596"><a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse24">Wisdom&nbsp;2:24</a></span> to which she succumbed as the more tender, and which she brought to bear upon the man, as she was the more apt to persuade&mdash; alas for my weakness, for that of my first father was mine; he forgot the commandment which had been given him, and yielded to the baleful fruit; and for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was banished at once from the tree of life, and from paradise, and from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and put on the coats of skins, that is, perhaps, the coarser flesh, both mortal and contradictory. And this was the first thing which he learned&mdash; his own shame&mdash; and he hid himself from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet here too he makes a gain, namely death and the cutting off of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in order that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may not be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. Thus, his punishment is changed into a mercy, for it is in mercy, I am persuaded, that God inflicts punishment.</p>

<p>IX. And having first been chastened by many means because his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were many, whose root of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> sprang up through various causes and sundry times, by word, by law, by <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, by benefits, by threats, by plagues, by waters, by fires, by <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, by victories, by defeats, by signs in heaven, and signs in the air, and in the earth, and in the sea; by unexpected changes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, of cities, of nations (the object of which was the destruction of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>) at last he needed a stronger remedy, for his diseases were growing worse; mutual slaughters, adulteries, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjuries</a>, unnatural crimes, and that first and last of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and the transfer of worship from the Creator to the creatures. As these required a greater aid, so they also obtained a greater. And that was that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> Himself, Who is before all worlds, the Invisible, the Incomprehensible, the Bodiless, the Beginning  of beginning, the Light of Light, the Source of Life and Immortality, the Image of the Archetype, the Immovable Seal, the Unchangeable Image, the Father's Definition and Word, came to His own Image, and took on Him Flesh for the sake of our flesh, and mingled Himself with an intelligent <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> sake, purifying like by like; and in all points except <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was made Man; conceived by the Virgin, who first in body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was purified by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, for it was needful both That Child-bearing should be honoured and that Virginity should receive a higher <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. He came forth then, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with That which He had assumed; one Person in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, flesh and Spirit, of which the latter deified the former. O new commingling; O strange conjunction! The Self-existent comes into Being, the Uncreated is created, That which cannot be contained is contained by the intervention of an intellectual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> mediating between the Deity and the corporeity of the flesh. And He who gives riches becomes poor; for He assumes the poverty of my flesh, that I may assume the riches of His Godhead. He that is full empties Himself; for He empties Himself of His Glory for a short while, that I may have a share in His Fulness. What is the riches of His Goodness? What is this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> that is around me? I had a share in the Image and I did not keep it; He partakes of my flesh that He may both save the Image and make the flesh <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. He communicates a Second Communion, far more marvellous than the first, inasmuch as then He imparted the better nature, but now He Himself assumes the worse. This is more godlike than the former action; this is loftier in the eyes of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of understanding.</p>

<p>X. But perhaps some one of those who are too impetuous and festive may say, <q>What has all this to do with us? Spur on your horse to the goal; talk to us about the Festival and the reasons for our being here today.</q> Yes, this is what I am about to do, although I have begun at a somewhat previous point, being compelled to do so by the needs of my argument. There will be no harm in the eyes of scholars and lovers of the beautiful if we say a few words about the word Pascha itself, for such an addition will not be useless in their ears. This great and venerable Pascha is called Phaska by the Hebrews in their own language; and the word means Passing Over. Historically, from their flight and migration from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> into the Land of Canaan; spiritually, from the progress and ascent from things below to things above and to the Land of Promise. And we observe that a thing which we often find to have happened in Scripture, the change of certain nouns from an uncertain to a clearer sense, or from a coarser to a more refined, has taken place in this instance. For some people, supposing this to be a name of the Sacred Passion, and in consequence Grecizing the word by changing Phi and Kappa into Pi and Chi, called the Day Pascha.  And custom took it up and confirmed the word, with the help of the ears of most people, to whom it had a more <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> sound.</p>

<p>XI. But before our time the Holy Apostle declared that the Law was but a shadow of things to come, <span class="stiki" id="note314598"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse1">Hebrews&nbsp;10:1</a></span> which are conceived by thought. And God too, who in still older times gave oracles to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, said when giving <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> concerning these things, See thou make all things according to the pattern showed you in the Mount, <span class="stiki" id="note314599"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse40">Exodus&nbsp;25:40</a></span> when He showed him the visible things as an adumbration of and design for the things that are invisible. And I am persuaded that none of these things has been ordered in vain, none without a reason, none in a grovelling manner or unworthy of the legislation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the ministry of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, even though it be difficult in each type to find a theory descending to the most delicate details, to every point about the Tabernacle itself, and its measures and materials, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> and Priests who carried them, and all the particulars which were enacted about the Sacrifices and the purifications and the Offerings;  and though these are only to be understood by those who rank with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or have made the nearest approach to his learning. For in that Mount itself God is seen by men; on the one hand through His own descent from His lofty abode, on the other through His drawing us up from our abasement on earth, that the Incomprehensible may be in some degree, and as far as is safe, comprehended by a mortal nature. For in no other way is it possible for the denseness of a material body and an imprisoned mind to come into consciousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except by His assistance. Then therefore all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> do not seem to have been deemed worthy of the same rank and position; but one of one place and one of another, each, I think, according to the measure of his own purification. Some have even been altogether driven away, and only permitted to hear the Voice from on high, namely those whose dispositions are altogether like wild beasts, and who are unworthy of divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>.</p>

<p>XII. But we, standing midway between those whose minds are utterly dense on the one side, and on the other those who are very contemplative and exalted, that we may neither remain quite idle and immovable, nor yet be more busy than we ought, and fall short of and be estranged from our purpose&mdash; for the former course is Jewish and very low, and the latter is only fit for the dream-soothsayer, and both alike are to be condemned&mdash; let us say our say upon these matters, so far as is within our reach, and not very absurd, or exposed to the ridicule of the multitude. Our belief is that since it was needful that we, who had fallen in consequence of the original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and had been led away by pleasure, even as far as <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and unlawful bloodshed, should be recalled and raised up again to our original position through the tender mercy of God our Father, Who could not endure that such a noble work of His own hands as Man should be lost to Him; the method of our new creation, and of what should be done, was this:&mdash; that all violent remedies were disapproved, as not likely to persuade us, and as quite possibly tending to add to the plague, through our chronic <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; but that God disposed things to our restoration by a gentle and kindly method of cure. For a crooked sapling will not bear a sudden bending the other way, or <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> from the hand that would straighten it, but will be more quickly broken than straightened; and a horse of a hot temper and above a certain age will not endure the tyranny of the bit without some coaxing and encouragement. Therefore the Law is given to us as an assistance, like a boundary wall between God and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, drawing us away from one and to the Other. And it concedes a little at first, that it may receive that which is greater. It concedes the Sacrifices for a time, that it may establish God in us, and then when the fitting time shall come may abolish the Sacrifices also; thus wisely changing our minds by gradual removals, and bringing us over to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> when we have already been trained to a prompt <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>.</p>

<p>XIII. Thus then and for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the written Law came in, gathering us into Christ; and this is the account of the Sacrifices as I account for them. And that you may not be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the depth of His Wisdom and the riches of His unsearchable judgments, <span class="stiki" id="note314601"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse33">Romans&nbsp;11:33</a></span> He did not leave even these unhallowed altogether, or useless, or with nothing in them but mere blood.  But that great, and if I may say so, in Its first nature unsacrificeable Victim, was intermingled with the Sacrifices of the Law, and was a purification, not for a part of the world, nor for a short time, but for the whole world and for all time. For this reason a Lamb was chosen for its innocence, and its clothing of the original nakedness. For such is the Victim, That was offered for us, Who is both in Name and fact the Garment of incorruption. And He was a perfect Victim not only on account of His Godhead, than which nothing is more perfect; but also on account of that which He assumed having been anointed with Deity, and having become one with That which anointed It, and I am bold to say, made equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A Male, because offered for Adam; or rather the Stronger for the strong, when the first Man had fallen under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and chiefly because there is in Him nothing feminine, nothing unmanly; but He burst from the bonds of the Virgin-Mother's womb with much power, and a Male was brought forth by the Prophetess, <span class="stiki" id="note314603"><a href="../bible/isa013.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;13:3</a></span> as Isaiah declares the good tidings. And of a year old, because He is the Sun of Righteousness <span class="stiki" id="note314604"><a href="../bible/mal004.htm#verse2">Malachi&nbsp;4:2</a></span> setting out from heaven, and circumscribed by His visible Nature, and returning unto Himself.  And <q>The blessed crown of Goodness,</q>&mdash; being on every side equal to Himself and alike; and not only this, but also as giving life to all the circle of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, gently commingled and intermixed with each other, according to the Law of Love and Order.  And Immaculate and guileless, as being the Healer of faults, and of the defects and taints that come from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For though He both took on Him our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and bare our diseases, <span class="stiki" id="note314607"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;53:4</a></span> yet He did not Himself suffer anything that needed healing. For He was tempted in all points like as we are yet without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note314608"><a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse15">Hebrews&nbsp;4:15</a></span> For he that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the Light that shines in darkness could not overtake Him.</p>

<p>XIV. What more? The First Month is introduced, or rather the beginning of months, whether it was so among the Hebrews from the beginning, or was made so later on this account, and became the first in consequence of the Mystery; and the tenth of the Month, for this is the most complete number, of units the first perfect unit, and the parent of perfection. And it is kept until the fifth day, perhaps because the Victim, of Whom I am speaking, purifies the five senses, from which comes falling into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and around which the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> rages, inasmuch as they are open to the incitements to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And it was chosen, not only out of the lambs, but also out of the inferior species, which are placed on the left hand <span class="stiki" id="note314609"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;25:33</a></span> &mdash; the kids; because He is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> not only for the righteous, but also for sinners; and perhaps even more for these, inasmuch as we have greater need of His mercy. And we need not be surprised that a lamb for a house should be required as the best course, but if that could not be, then one might be obtained by contributions (owing to poverty) for the houses of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; because it is clearly best that each individual should suffice for his own perfecting, and should offer his own living <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> unto God Who called him, being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at all times and in every respect. But if that cannot be, then that those who are akin in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and of like disposition should be made use of as helpers. For I think this provision means that we should communicate of the Sacrifice to those who are nearest, if there be need.</p>

<p>XV. Then comes the Sacred Night, the Anniversary of the confused darkness of the present life, into which the prim&aelig;val darkness is dissolved, and all things come into life and rank and form, and that which was chaos is reduced to order. Then we flee from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, that is from sullen <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and from <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> the unseen tyrant, and the bitter taskmasters, changing our quarters to the world above; and are delivered from the clay and the brickmaking, and from the husks and dangers of this fleshly condition, which for most men is only not overpowered by mere husklike calculations. Then the Lamb is slain, and act and word are sealed with the Precious Blood; that is, habit and action, the sideposts of our doors; I mean, of course, of the movements of mind and opinion, which are rightly opened and closed by <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, since there is a limit even to thoughts. Then the last and gravest plague upon the persecutors, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> worthy of the night; and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> mourns the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of her own reasonings and actions which are also called in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> the Seed of the Chaldeans <span class="stiki" id="note314610"><a href="../bible/jth005.htm#verse6">Judith&nbsp;5:6</a></span> removed, and the children of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> dashed against the rocks and destroyed;  and the whole air is full of the cry and clamour of the Egyptians; and then the Destroyer of them shall withdraw from us in reverence of the Unction. Then the removal of leaven; that is, of the old and sour <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, not of that which is quickening and makes bread; for seven days, a number which is of all the most mystical,  and is co-ordinate with this present world, that we may not lay in provision of any <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> dough, or relic of <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisaic</a> or ungodly teaching.</p>

<p>XVI. Well, let them lament; we will feed on the Lamb toward evening&mdash; for Christ's Passion was in the completion of the ages; because too He communicated His Disciples in the evening with His Sacrament, destroying the darkness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and not sodden, but roast&mdash; that our word may have in it nothing that is unconsidered or watery, or easily made away with; but may be entirely consistent and solid, and free from all that is impure and from all vanity. And let us be aided by the good coals, <span class="stiki" id="note314613"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;6:6</a></span> kindling and purifying our minds from Him That comes to send fire on the earth, <span class="stiki" id="note314614"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;12:49</a></span> that shall destroy all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> habits, and to hasten its kindling. Whatsoever then there be, of solid and nourishing in the Word, shall be eaten with the inward parts and hidden things of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and shall be consumed and given up to spiritual digestion; aye, from head to foot, that is, from the first contemplations of Godhead to the very last thoughts about the Incarnation. Neither let us carry anything of it abroad, nor leave it till the morning; because most of our Mysteries may not be carried out to them that are outside, nor is there beyond this night any further purification; and procrastination is not creditable to those who have a share in the Word. For just as it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and well-pleasing to God not to let <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> last through the day, <span class="stiki" id="note314615"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse26">Ephesians&nbsp;4:26</a></span> but to get rid of it before sunset, whether you take this of time or in a mystical sense, for it is not safe for us that the Sun of Righteousness should go down upon our <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; so too we ought not to let such Food remain all night, nor to put it off till tomorrow. But whatever is of bony nature and not fit for food and hard for us even to understand, this must not be broken; that is, badly divined and misconceived (I need not say that in the history not a bone of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was broken, even though His death was hastened by His crucifiers on account of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>);  nor must it be stripped off and thrown away, lest that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> should be given to the dogs, <span class="stiki" id="note314617"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span> that is, to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> hearers of the Word; just as the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> pearl of the Word is not to be cast before swine; but it shall be consumed with the fire with which the burnt offerings also are consumed, being refined and preserved by the Spirit That searches and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things, not destroyed in the waters, nor scattered abroad as the calf's head which was hastily made by <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314618"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;32:20</a></span> for a reproach for their hardness of heart.</p>

<p>XVII. Nor would it be right for us to pass over the manner of this eating either, for the Law does not do so, but carries its mystical labour even to this point in the literal enactment. Let us consume the Victim in haste, eating It with unleavened bread, with bitter herbs, and with our loins girded, and our shoes on our feet, and leaning on staves like old men; with haste, that we fall not into that fault which was forbidden to <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> <span class="stiki" id="note314619"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;19:17</a></span> by the commandment, that we look not around, nor stay in all that neighbourhood, but that we escape to the mountain, that we be not overtaken by the strange fire of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, nor be congealed into a pillar of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> in consequence of our turning back to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; for this is the result of delay. <em>With bitter herbs</em>, for a life according to the Will of God is bitter and arduous, especially to beginners, and higher than pleasures. For although the new yoke is easy and the burden light, <span class="stiki" id="note314620"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;11:20</a></span> as you are told, yet this is on account of the hope and the reward, which is far more abundant than the hardships of this life. If it were not so, who would not say that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is more full of toil and trouble than the enactments of the Law? For, while the Law prohibits only the completed acts of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we are condemned for the causes also, almost as if they were acts. The Law says, <em>You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a></em>; but <em>you</em> may not even <em>desire</em>, kindling passion by curious and earnest looks. <em>You shall not kill</em>, says the Law; but you are not even to return a blow, but on the contrary are to offer yourself to the smiter. How much more <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> than the Law! <em>You shall not forswear yourself</em> is the Law; but <em>you</em> are not to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> at all, either a greater or a lesser <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, for an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is the parent of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> <em>. You shall not join house to house, nor field to field, oppressing the poor</em>; <span class="stiki" id="note314621"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;5:8</a></span> but you are to set aside willingly even your just possessions, and to be stripped for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, that without encumbrance you may take up the Cross <span class="stiki" id="note314622"><a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse21">Mark&nbsp;10:21</a></span> and be enriched with the unseen riches.</p>

<p>XVIII. And let the loins of the unreasoning animals be unbound and loose, for they have not the gift of reason which can overcome pleasure (it is not needful to say that even they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the limit of natural movement). But let that part of your being which is the seat of passion, and which neighs, <span class="stiki" id="note314623"><a href="../bible/jer005.htm#verse8">Jeremiah&nbsp;5:8</a></span> as <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> calls it, when sweeping away this shameful passion, be restrained by a girdle of continence, so that you may eat the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> purely, having mortified your members which are upon the earth, <span class="stiki" id="note314624"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> and copying the girdle <span class="stiki" id="note314625"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;3:4</a></span> of John, the Hermit and Forerunner and great Herald of the Truth. Another girdle I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, the soldierly and manly one, I mean, from which the Euzoni of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and certain Monozoni  take their name. And it is in respect of this too that God says in an oracle to Job, <q>Nay, but gird up your loins like a man, and give a manly answer.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note314627"><a href="../bible/job038.htm#verse3">Job&nbsp;38:3</a></span> With this also <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David boasts that he is girded with strength from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  and speaks of God Himself as clothed with strength  and girded about with power&mdash; against the ungodly of course&mdash; though perhaps some may prefer to see in this a declaration of the abundance of His power, and, as it were, its restraint, just as also He clothes Himself with Light as with a garment.  For who shall endure His unrestrained power and light? Do I enquire what there is common to the loins and to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? What then is the meaning to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> of the expression, <q>Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note314631"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse14">Ephesians&nbsp;5:14</a></span> Is it perhaps that <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> is to restrain concupiscence, and not to allow it to be carried in another direction? For that which is disposed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in a particular direction will not have the same power towards other pleasures.</p>

<p>XIX. And as to <em>shoes</em>, let him who is about to touch the Holy Land which the feet of God have trodden, put them off, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did upon the Mount, <span class="stiki" id="note314632"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse5">Exodus&nbsp;3:5</a></span> that he may bring there nothing dead; nothing to come between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So too if any <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> is sent to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, let him go in a spirit of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and without excess, inasmuch as he must, besides being without money and without staff and with but one coat, also be barefooted, <span class="stiki" id="note314633"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;10:9</a></span> that the feet of those who preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Peace and every other good may appear beautiful. <span class="stiki" id="note314634"><a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;52:7</a></span> But he who would flee from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the things of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> must put on shoes for safety's sake, especially in regard to the scorpions and snakes in which <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> so abounds, so as not to be injured by those which watch the heel <span class="stiki" id="note314635"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse15">Genesis&nbsp;3:15</a></span> which also we are bidden to tread under foot. <span class="stiki" id="note314636"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;10:19</a></span> And concerning <em>the staff</em> and the signification of it, my belief is as follows. There is one I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to lean upon, and another which belongs to Pastors and Teachers, and which corrects <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sheep. Now the Law prescribes to you the staff to lean upon, that you may not break down in your mind when you hear of God's Blood, and His Passion, and His death; and that you may not be carried away to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in your defence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but without shame and without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> may eat the Flesh and drink the Blood, if you are desirous of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life, neither disbelieving His words about His Flesh, nor offended at those about His Passion. Lean upon this, and stand firm and strong, in nothing shaken by the adversaries nor carried away by the plausibility of their arguments. Stand upon your High Place; in the Courts of Jerusalem  place your feet; lean upon the Rock, that your steps in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be not shaken.</p>

<p>XX. What do you say? Thus it has pleased Him that you should come forth  out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the iron furnace; that you should leave behind the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> of that country, and be led by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and his lawgiving and martial rule. I give you a piece of advice which is not my own, or rather which is very much my own, if you consider the matter spiritually. Borrow from the Egyptians vessels of gold and silver; <span class="stiki" id="note314639"><a href="../bible/exo011.htm#verse2">Exodus&nbsp;11:2</a></span> with these take your journey; supply yourself for the road with the goods of strangers, or rather with your own. There is money owing to you, the wages of your bondage and of your brickmaking; be clever on your side too in asking retribution; be an honest robber. You suffered wrong there while you were fighting with the clay (that is, this troublesome and filthy body) and wast building cities foreign and unsafe, whose memorial perishes with a cry.  What then? Do you come out for nothing and without wages? But why will you leave to the Egyptians and to the powers of your adversaries that which they have gained by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and will spend with yet greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>? It does not belong to them: they have ravished it, and have sacrilegiously taken it as plunder from Him who says, The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine, <span class="stiki" id="note314641"><a href="../bible/hag002.htm#verse8">Haggai&nbsp;2:8</a></span> and I give it to whom I will. Yesterday it was theirs, for it was permitted to be so; today the Master takes it and gives it to you, <span class="stiki" id="note314642"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;20:14</a></span> that you may make a good and saving use of it. Let us make to ourselves friends of the Mammon of unrighteousness, <span class="stiki" id="note314643"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;16:9</a></span> that when we fail, they may receive us in the time of judgment.</p>

<p>XXI. If you are a Rachel or a Leah, a patriarchal and great <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, steal whatever <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of your father you can find; <span class="stiki" id="note314644"><a href="../bible/gen031.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;31:19</a></span> not, however, that you may keep them, but that you may destroy them; and if you are a wise Israelite remove them to the Land of the Promise, and let the persecutor grieve over the loss of them, and learn through being outwitted that it was vain for him to tyrannize over and keep in bondage better men than himself. If you do this, and comest out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> thus, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well that you shall be guided by the pillar of fire and cloud by night and day. <span class="stiki" id="note314645"><a href="../bible/exo013.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;13:20</a></span> The wilderness shall be tamed for you, and the Sea divided;  <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> shall be drowned; <span class="stiki" id="note314647"><a href="../bible/exo014.htm#verse28">Exodus&nbsp;14:28</a></span> bread shall be rained down:  the rock shall become a fountain;  Amalek shall be conquered, not with arms alone, but with the hostile hand of the righteous forming both <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and the invincible trophy of the Cross;  the River shall be cut off; the sun shall stand still; and the moon be restrained; <span class="stiki" id="note314651"><a href="../bible/jos003.htm#verse15">Joshua&nbsp;3:15-16</a></span> walls shall be overthrown even without engines;  swarms of hornets shall go before you to make a way for <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and to hold the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in check;  and all the other events which are told in the history after these and with these (not to make a long story) shall be given you of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Such is the feast you are keeping today; and in this manner I would have you celebrate both the Birthday and the Burial of Him Who was born for you and suffered for you. Such is the Mystery of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>; such are the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> sketched by the Law and fulfilled by Christ, the Abolisher of the letter, the Perfecter of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, who by His Passion taught us how to suffer, and by His glorification grants us to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> with Him.</p>

<p>XXII.  Now we are to examine another fact and dogma, neglected by most people, but in my judgment well worth enquiring into. To Whom was that Blood offered that was shed for us, and why was It shed? I mean the precious and famous Blood of our God and High <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and Sacrifice. We were detained in bondage by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>, sold under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and receiving pleasure in exchange for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Now, since a ransom belongs only to him who holds in bondage, I ask to whom was this offered, and for what <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>? If to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>, fie upon the outrage! If the robber receives ransom, not only from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but a ransom which consists of God Himself, and has such an illustrious payment for his tyranny, a payment for whose sake it would have been right for him to have left us alone altogether. But if to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, I ask first, how? For it was not by Him that we were being oppressed; and next, On what principle did the Blood of His Only begotten Son delight the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who would not receive even Isaac, when he was being offered by his Father, but changed the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, putting a ram in the place of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> victim?  Is it not evident that the Father accepts Him, but neither asked for Him nor demanded Him; but on account of the Incarnation, and because Humanity must be sanctified by the Humanity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  that He might deliver us Himself, and overcome the tyrant, and draw us to Himself by the mediation of His Son, Who also arranged this to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Whom it is manifest that He obeys in all things? So much we have said of Christ; the greater part of what we might say shall be reverenced with silence. But that brazen serpent <span class="stiki" id="note314657"><a href="../bible/num021.htm#verse9">Numbers&nbsp;21:9</a></span> was hung up as a remedy for the biting serpents, not as a type of Him that suffered for us, but as a contrast; and it saved those that looked upon it, not because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it to live, but because it was killed, and killed with it the powers that were subject to it, being destroyed as it deserved. And what is the fitting epitaph for it from us? <q>O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?</q>  You are overthrown by the Cross; you are slain by Him who is the Giver of life; you are without breath, dead, without motion, even though you keep the form of a serpent lifted up on high on a pole.</p>

<p>XXIII. Now we will partake of a <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> which is still typical; though it is plainer than the old one. For that is ever new which is now becoming <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. It is ours to learn what is that drinking and that enjoyment, and His to teach and communicate the Word to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. For teaching is food, even to the Giver of food. Come hither then, and let us partake of the Law, but in a <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> manner, not a literal one; perfectly, not imperfectly; <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, not temporarily. Let us make our Head, not the earthly Jerusalem, but the heavenly City; <span class="stiki" id="note314659"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse22">Hebrews&nbsp;12:22</a></span> not that which is now trodden under foot by armies, <span class="stiki" id="note314660"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;21:20-24</a></span> but that which is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by Angels. Let us <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> not young calves, nor lambs that put forth horns and hoofs,  in which many parts are destitute of life and feeling; but let us <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to God the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise upon the heavenly Altar, with the heavenly dances; let us hold aside the first veil; let us approach the second, and look into the Holy of Holies.  Shall I say that which is a greater thing yet? Let us <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> <em>ourselves</em> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; or rather let us go on <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> throughout every day and at every moment. Let us accept anything for the Word's sake. By sufferings let us imitate His Passion: by our blood let us reverence His Blood: let us gladly mount upon the Cross. Sweet are the nails, though they be very painful. For to suffer with Christ and for Christ is better than a life of ease with others.</p>

<p>XXIV. If you are a Simon of Cyrene, <span class="stiki" id="note314663"><a href="../bible/mar015.htm#verse21">Mark&nbsp;15:21</a></span> take up the Cross and follow. If you are crucified with Him as a robber, <span class="stiki" id="note314664"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;23:42</a></span> acknowledge God as a <em>penitent</em> robber. If even He was numbered among the transgressors <span class="stiki" id="note314665"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;53:12</a></span> for you and your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, do you become law-abiding for His sake. Worship Him Who was hanged for you, even if you yourself are hanging; make some gain even from your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; purchase <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by your death; enter with Jesus into Paradise, <span class="stiki" id="note314666"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;23:43</a></span> so that you may learn from what you have fallen. <span class="stiki" id="note314667"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse5">Revelation&nbsp;2:5</a></span> Contemplate the glories that are there; let the murderer die outside with his <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>; and if you be a Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a, <span class="stiki" id="note314668"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse52">Luke&nbsp;23:52</a></span> beg the Body from him that crucified Him, make your own that which cleanses the world. <span class="stiki" id="note314669"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:7</a></span> If you be a <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, the worshipper of God by night, bury Him with spices. <span class="stiki" id="note314670"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;19:39</a></span> If you be a Mary, or another Mary, or a Salome, or a Joanna, weep in the early morning. Be first to see the stone taken away,  and perhaps you will see the Angels and Jesus Himself. Say something; hear His Voice. If He say to you, Touch Me not,  stand afar off; reverence the Word, but grieve not; for He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> those to whom He appears first. Keep the feast of the Resurrection; come to the aid of Eve who was first to fall, of Her who first embraced the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and made Him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Be a Peter or a John; hasten to the Sepulchre, running together, running against one another, vying in the noble race.  And even if you be beaten in speed, win the victory of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; not Looking into the tomb, but Going in. And if, like a Thomas, you were left out when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were assembled to whom Christ shows Himself, when you do see Him be not faithless;  and if you do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, then <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> those who tell you; and if you cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them either, then have confidence in the print of the nails. If He descend into Hell, <span class="stiki" id="note314675"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:19</a></span> descend with Him. Learn to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of Christ there also, what is the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> purpose of the twofold descent, to save all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> absolutely by His manifestation, or there too only them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</p>

<p>XXV. And if He ascend up into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314676"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse51">Luke&nbsp;24:51</a></span> ascend with Him. Be one of those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who escort Him, or one of those who receive Him. Bid the gates be lifted up,  or be made higher, that they may receive Him, exalted after His Passion. Answer to those who are in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> because He bears up with Him His body and the tokens of His Passion, which He had not when He came down, and who therefore inquire, <q>Who is this King of Glory?</q> that it is the Lord strong and mighty, as in all things that He has done from time to time and does, so now in His battle and triumph for the sake of Mankind. And give to the doubting of the question the twofold answer. And if they marvel and say as in Isaiah's drama Who is this that comes from Edom and from the things of earth? Or How are the garments red of Him that is without blood or body, as of one that treads in the full wine-press? <span class="stiki" id="note314678"><a href="../bible/isa063.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;63:1</a></span> set forth the beauty of the array of the Body that suffered, adorned by the Passion, and made splendid by the Godhead, than which nothing can be more lovely or more beautiful.</p>

<p>XXVI.  To this what will those cavillers say, those bitter reasoners about Godhead, those detractors of all things that are praiseworthy, those darkeners of Light, uncultured in respect of Wisdom, for whom Christ died in vain, unthankful creatures, the work of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>. Do you turn this benefit into a reproach to God? Will you deem Him little on this account, that He humbled Himself for your sake, and because to seek for that which had wandered the Good Shepherd, He who lays down His life for the sheep, <span class="stiki" id="note314680"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;10:11</a></span> came upon the mountains and hills upon which you used to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314681"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;5:35</a></span> and found the wandering one; and having found it, took it upon His shoulders, <span class="stiki" id="note314682"><a href="../bible/hos004.htm#verse13">Hosea&nbsp;4:13</a></span> on which He also bore the wood; and having borne it, brought it back to the life above; and having brought it back, numbered it among those who have never strayed. That He lit a candle, <span class="stiki" id="note314683"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse4">Luke&nbsp;15:4-5</a></span> His own flesh, and swept the house, by cleansing away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world, and sought for the coin, the Royal Image that was all covered up with <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and calls together His friends, the Angelic Powers, at the finding of the coin, and makes them sharers of His <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, as He had before made them sharers of the secret of His Incarnation? That the Light that is exceeding bright should follow the Candle&mdash; Forerunner,  and the Word, the Voice, and the Bridegroom, the Bridegroom's friend,  that prepared for the Lord a peculiar people  and cleansed them by the water <span class="stiki" id="note314687"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;3:11</a></span> in preparation for the Spirit? Do you Reproach God with this? Do you conceive of Him as less because He girds Himself with a towel and washes His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314688"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;13:4-5</a></span> and shows that humiliation is the best road to exaltation; <span class="stiki" id="note314689"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;23:12</a></span> because He humbles Himself for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is bent down to the ground,  that He may even exalt with Himself that which is bent double under a weight of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? How comes it that you do not also charge it upon Him as a crime that He eats with Publicans <span class="stiki" id="note314691"><a href="../bible/mar002.htm#verse15">Mark&nbsp;2:15-16</a></span> and at Publicans' tables, and makes <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Publicans <span class="stiki" id="note314692"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse2">Luke&nbsp;15:2</a></span> that He too may make some gain. And what gain? The <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of sinners. If so, one must blame the physician for stooping over suffering and putting up with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> smells in order to give health to the sick; and him also who leans over the ditch, that he may, according to the Law, save the beast that has fallen into it.</p>

<p>XXVII. He was sent, but sent according to His Manhood (for He was of two Natures), since He was hungry and thirsty and weary, and was distressed and wept, according to the Laws of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But even if He were sent also as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what of that? Consider the Mission to be the good pleasure of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, to which He refers all that concerns Himself, both that He may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Eternal Principle, and that He may avoid the appearance of being a rival God. For He is said on the one hand to have been betrayed, and on the other it is written that He gave Himself up; and so too that He was raised and taken up by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and also that of His own power He rose and ascended. The former belongs to the Good Pleasure, the latter to His own Authority; but you dwell upon all that diminishes Him, while you ignore all that exalts Him. For instance, you score that He suffered, but you do not add <q>of His own Will.</q> Ah, what things has the Word even now to suffer! By some He is honoured as God but confused with the Father; by others He is dishonoured as Flesh, and is severed from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. With whom shall He be most <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>&mdash; or rather which shall He forgive&mdash; those who <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> contract Him, or those who divide Him? For the former ought to have made a distinction, and the latter to have made a Union, the one in number, the other in Godhead. Do you stumble at His Flesh? So did the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Do you call Him a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note314693"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse48">John&nbsp;8:48</a></span> and the rest which I will not utter? This did not even the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, O man more unbelieving than <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and more stupid than <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> recognized the title Son as expressing equal rank; and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He who drove them out was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for they were persuaded by their own experience. But you will not either admit the equality or confess the Godhead. It would have been better for you to have been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniac</a>&mdash; to reduce the matter to an absurdity&mdash; than in uncircumcision and robust health to be thus ill and ungodly disposed. But for our <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with such men, let it be brought to an end by their returning, however late, to a sound <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, if they will; or else if they will not, let it be postponed to another occasion, if they continue as they are. Anyhow, we will have no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> when contending for the Trinity with the help of the Trinity.</p>

<p>XXVIII. It is now needful for us to sum up our discourse as follows: We were created that we might be made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. We were made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> when we were created. We were entrusted with Paradise that we might enjoy life. We received a Commandment that we might obtain a good repute by keeping it; not that God did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what would take place, but because He had laid down the law of Free Will. We were deceived because we were the objects of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. We were cast out because we transgressed. We fasted because we refused to fast, being overpowered by the Tree of Knowledge. For the Commandment was ancient, coeval with ourselves, and was a kind of education of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and curb of luxury, to which we were reasonably made subject, in order that we might recover by keeping it that which we had lost by not keeping it. We needed an Incarnate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a God <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, that we might live. We were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> together with Him, that we might be cleansed; we rose again with Him because we were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> with Him; we were <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> with Him, because we rose again with Him.</p>

<p>XXIX. Many indeed are the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of that time: God crucified; the sun darkened and again rekindled; for it was fitting that the creatures should suffer with their Creator; the veil rent; the Blood and Water shed from His Side; the one as from a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the other as above man; the rocks rent for the Rock's sake; the dead raised for a pledge of the final Resurrection of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; the Signs at the Sepulchre and after the Sepulchre, which none can worthily celebrate; and yet none of these equal to the Miracle of my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. A few drops of Blood recreate the whole world, and become to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> what rennet is to milk, drawing us together and compressing us into unity.</p>

<p>XXX. But, O Pascha, great and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and purifier of all the world&mdash; for I will speak to you as to a living person&mdash; O <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> and Light and Life and Wisdom and Might&mdash; for I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in all Your names&mdash; O Offspring and Expression and Signet of the Great Mind; O Word conceived and Man contemplated, Who bearest all things, binding them by the Word of Your power; receive this discourse, not now as firstfruits, but perhaps as the completion of my offerings, a thanksgiving, and at the same time a supplication, that we may suffer no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> beyond those necessary and sacred cares in which our life has been passed; and stay the tyranny of the body over us; (You see, O Lord, how great it is and how it bows me down) or Your own sentence, if we are to be condemned by You. But if we are to be released, in accordance with our desire, and be received into the Heavenly Tabernacle, there too it may be we shall offer You acceptable Sacrifices upon Your Altar, to Father and Word and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; for to You belongs all <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and might, world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
