<h1>Oration on Simeon and Anna</h1>

<p class="h1a">On the Day that They Met in the Temple. </p>

<p>I. Although I have before, as briefly as possible, in my dialogue on <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, sufficiently laid the foundations, as it were, for a discourse on <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, yet today the season has brought forward the entire subject of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and its incorruptible crown, for the delightful consideration of the Church's foster-children. For today the council chamber of the divine oracles is opened wide, and the signs prefiguring this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> day, with its effects and issues, are by the sacred preachers read over to the assembled Church. Today the accomplishment of that ancient and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> counsel is, in fact and deed, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> manifested to the world. Today, without any covering, <span class="stiki" id="note062913"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:18</a></span> and with unveiled face, we see, as in a mirror, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord, and the majesty of the divine ark itself. Today, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> assembly, bearing upon its shoulders the heavenly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> that was for generations expected, imparts it to the race of man. <q>Old things are passed away</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062914"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> &mdash; -things new burst forth into flowers, and such as fade not away. No longer does the stern decree of the law bear sway, but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord reigns, drawing all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to itself by saving long-suffering. No second time is an Uzziah <span class="stiki" id="note062915"><a href="../bible/2sa006.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;6:7</a></span> invisibly punished, for daring to touch what may not be touched; for God Himself invites, and who will stand hesitating with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? He says: <q>Come unto Me, all you that labour and are heavy laden.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062916"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;11:28</a></span> Who, then, will not run to Him? Let no Jew contradict the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, looking at the type which went before the house of Obededom. <span class="stiki" id="note062917"><a href="../bible/2sa006.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;6:10</a></span> The Lord has <q> <em>manifestly come to His own</em>.</q>  And sitting on a living and not inanimate ark, as upon the mercy-seat, He comes forth in solemn procession upon the earth. The <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>, when he touches this ark, comes away just; the harlot, when she approaches this, is remoulded, as it were, and becomes chaste; the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, when he touches this, is restored whole without pain. It repulses none; it shrinks from none; it imparts the gifts of healing, without itself contracting any disease; for the Lord, who loves and cares for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in it makes His resting-place. These are the gifts of this new <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. This is that new and strange thing that has happened under the sun <span class="stiki" id="note062919"><a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse10">Sirach&nbsp;1:10</a></span> &mdash; a thing that never had place before, nor will have place again. That which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of His compassion toward us foreordained has come to pass, He has given it fulfilment because of that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for man which is so becoming to Him. With good right, therefore, has the sacred trumpet sounded, <q>Old things are passed away, behold all things have become new.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062920"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> And what shall I conceive, what shall I speak worthy of this day? I am struggling to reach the inaccessible, for the remembrance of this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> virgin far transcends all words of mine. Wherefore, since the greatness of the panegyric required completely puts to shame our limited powers, let us betake ourselves to that hymn which is not beyond our faculties, and boasting in our own  unalterable defeat, let us join the rejoicing chorus of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flock, who are keeping holyday. And do you, my divine and saintly auditors, keep strict silence, in order that through the narrow channel of ears, as into the harbour of the understanding, the vessel freighted with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may peacefully sail. We keep festival, not according to the vain customs of the Greek mythology; we keep a feast which brings with it no ridiculous or frenzied banqueting  of the gods, but which teaches us the wondrous condescension to us men of the awful <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over all.<span class="stiki" id="note062923"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse5">Romans 9:5</a></span></p>

<p>II. Come, therefore, Isaiah, most solemn of preachers and greatest of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, wisely unfold to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the congregation in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and incite our excellent guests abundantly, to satiate themselves with enduring dainties, in order that, placing the reality which we possess over against that mirror of yours, truthful <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> as you are, you may joyfully clap your hands at the issue of your predictions. It came to pass, he says, <q>in the year in which king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the house was full of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And the seraphim stood round about him: each one had six wings. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And the posts of the door were moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. And I said, Woe is me! I am pricked to the heart, for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts. And one of the seraphim was sent unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. And he touched my mouth, and said, Lo, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is purged. Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I strict, and who will go unto this people? Then said I, Here am I; send me. And He said, Go, and tell this people, You hear indeed, but understand not; and you see indeed, but perceive not.</q>  These are the proclamations made beforehand by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> through the Spirit. Dearly beloved, consider the force of these words. So shall you understand the issue of these sacramental  <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both what and how great this assembling together of ourselves is. And since the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has before spoken of this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, come, and with the greatest ardour and exultation, and alacrity of heart, together with the keenest sagacity of your intelligence, and therewith approach <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> the renowned, and place before your mind an image clear and distinct, comparing the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> with the actual issue of events. You will not stand in need of many words to come to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the matter; only fix your eyes on the things which are taking place there. <q>All things <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> are plain to them that understand, and right to them that find <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062926"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse9">Proverbs 8:9</a></span> For, behold, as a throne high and lifted up by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him that fashioned it, the virgin-mother is there made ready, and that most evidently for the King, the Lord of hosts. Upon this, consider the Lord now coming unto you in sinful flesh. Upon this virginal throne, I say, worship Him who now comes to you by this new and ever-adorable way. Look around you with the eye of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and you will find around Him, as by the ordinance of their courses,  the royal and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> company of the seraphim. These, as His bodyguard, are ever wont to attend the presence of their king. Whence also in this place they are not only said to hymn with their praises the divine substance of the divine unity, but also the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to be adored by all of that one of the sacred Trinity, which now, by the appearance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the flesh, has even lighted upon earth. They say: <q>The whole earth is full of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> For we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, together with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who was made man for oar sakes, according to the good pleasure of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>,  was also present the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who is inseparable from Him as to His divine nature, anal also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, who is of one and the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> with Him.  For, as says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the interpreter of the divine oracle,  <q>Cod was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062931"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse19">2 Corinthians 5:19</a></span> He thus shows that the Father was in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because that one and the same will worked in them.</p>

<p>III. Therefore, O lover of this festival, when you have considered well the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> &mdash; which were brought to pass for your sake &mdash; gladly join yourself to the heavenly host, which is celebrating magnificently your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.<span class="stiki" id="note062932"><a href="../bible/2sa006.htm#verse14">2 Samuel 6:14</a></span> As once David did before the ark, so do you, before this virginal throne, joyfully lead the dance. Hymn with gladsome song the Lord, who is always and everywhere present, and Him who from Teman, <span class="stiki" id="note062933"><a href="../bible/hab003.htm#verse3">Habakkuk 3:3</a></span> as says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, has thought fit to appear, and that in the flesh, to the race of men. Say, with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>He is my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and I will glorify Him; my father's <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and I will exalt Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062934"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse2">Exodus 15:2</a></span> Then, after your hymn of thanksgiving, we shall usefully inquire what <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> aroused the King of Glory to appear in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. His compassion for us compelled Him, who cannot be compelled, to be born in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. But what necessity was there that He, when a suckling infant,  that He who, though both in time, was not limited by time, that He, who though wrapped in swaddling clothes, was not by them held fast, what necessity was there that He should be an exile and a stranger from His country? Should you, forsooth, wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, you congregation most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and upon whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> has breathed, listen to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> proclaiming plainly to the people, stimulating them, as it were, to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this extraordinary nativity, and saying, <q>Every male that opens the womb, shall be called <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062936"><a href="../bible/exo031.htm#verse19">Exodus 31:19</a></span> O wondrous circumstance! <q>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062937"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse33">Romans 11:33</a></span> It became indeed the Lord of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to do all things in accordance with His own law, and not to make void the law, but to fulfil it, and rather to connect with the fulfilment of the law the beginning of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Therefore it is that the mother, who was superior to the law, submits to the law. And she, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and undefiled one, observes that time of forty days that was appointed for the unclean. And He who makes us free from the law, became subject to the law; and there is offered for Him, who has sanctified us, a pair of clean birds,<span class="stiki" id="note062938"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse24">Luke 11:24</a></span> in testimony of those who approach clean and blameless. Now that that parturition was polluted, and stood not in need of expiatory victims, Isaiah is our <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, who proclaims distinctly to the whole earth under the sun: <q>Before she travailed,</q> he says, <q>she brought forth before her pains came, she escaped, and brought forth a man-child.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062939"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse7">Isaiah 66:7</a></span> Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? The must <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> virgin mother, therefore, escaped entirely the manner of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> even before she brought forth: doubtless, in order that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, betrothing her unto Himself, and sanctifying her, she might conceive without intercourse with man. She has brought forth her <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> Son, even the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Him, I say, who in the heavens above shone forth as the only-begotten, without mother, from out His Father's substance, and preserved the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of His natural unity undivided and inseparable; and who on earth, in the virgin's nuptial chamber, joined to Himself the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Adam, like a bridegroom, by an inalienable union, and preserved His mother's purity uncorrupt and un injured&mdash; Him, in short, who in heaven was begotten without corruption, and on earth brought forth in a manner quite unspeakable. But to return to our subject.</p>

<p>IV. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> brought the virgin from <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, in order that she might give birth at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> to her salvation-bestowing child, and brought her back again to <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, in order to make manifest to the world the hope of life. Hence it was that the ark of God removed from the inn at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, for there He paid to the law that debt of the forty days, due not to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> but to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and rested upon the mountains of Sion, and receiving into His pure bosom as upon a lofty throne, and one transcending the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the Monarch of all,  she presented Him there to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as the joint-partner of His throne and inseparable from His nature, together with that pure and undefiled flesh which he had of her substance assumed. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother goes up to the temple to exhibit to the law a new and strange wonder, even that child long expected, who opened the virgin's womb, and yet did not burst the barriers of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>; that child, superior to the law, who yet fulfilled the law; that child that was at once before the law, and yet after it; that child, in short, who was of her incarnate beyond the law of nature.  For in other cases every womb being first opened by connection with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and, being impregnated by his seed, receives the beginning of conception, and by the pangs which make perfect parturition, does at length bring forth to light its offspring endowed with reason, and with its nature consistent, in accordance with the wise provision of God its Creator. For God said, <q>Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.</q> But the womb of this virgin, without being opened before, or being impregnated with seed, gave birth to an offspring that transcended nature, while at the same time it was cognate to it, and that without detriment to the indivisible unity, so that the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> was the more stupendous, the prerogative of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> likewise remaining intact. She goes up, therefore to the temple, she who was more exalted than the temple, clothed with a double <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, I say, of undefiled <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and that of ineffable fecundity, the benediction of the law, and the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Wherefore he says who saw it: <q>And the whole house was full of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the seraphim stood round about him; and one cried unto another, and said. Holy, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062942"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse3">Isaiah 6:3</a></span> As also the blessed <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Habakkuk has charmingly sung, saying, <q>In the midst of two living creatures you shall be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: as the years draw near you shall be recognised&mdash; when the time has come you shall be shown forth.</q>  See, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, the exceeding accuracy of the Spirit. He speaks of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, recognition, showing forth. As to the first of these: <q>In the midst of two living creatures you shall be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062944"><a href="../bible/hab003.htm#verse2">Habakkuk 3:2</a></span> he refers to that overshadowing of the divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which, in the time of the law, rested in the Holy of holies upon the covering of the ark, between the typical <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, as He says to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>There will I be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062945"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse22">Exodus 25:22</a></span> But He refers likewise to that concourse of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, which has now come to meet us, by the divine and ever adorable manifestation of the Saviour Himself in the flesh, although He in His very nature cannot be beheld by us, as Isaiah has even before declared.

<p>V. Tremendous, verily, is the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> connected with you, O virgin mother, you spiritual throne, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> and made worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  You have brought forth, before the eyes of those in heaven and earth, a pre-eminent wonder. And it is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this, and an irrefragable argument, that at the novelty of your supernatural child-bearing, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> sang on earth, <q>Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062950"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse14">Luke 2:14</a></span> by their threefold song bringing in a threefold <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.  Blessed are you among the generations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, O you of God most blessed, for by you the earth has been filled with that divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as in the Psalms it is sung: <q>Blessed be the Lord God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the whole earth shall be filled with His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q>  And the posts of the door, says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, moved at the voice of him that cried, by which is signified the veil of the temple drawn before the ark of the covenant, which typified you, that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> might be laid open to me, and also that I might be taught, by the types and figures which went before, to approach with reverence and trembling to do <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the sacred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which is connected with you; and that by means of this prior shadow-painting of the law I might be restrained from boldly and irreverently contemplating with fixed gaze Him who, in His incomprehensibility, is seated far above all.  For if to the ark, which was the image and type of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> was paid of God that to no one but to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> order only was the access to it open, or ingress allowed to behold it, the veil separating it off, and keeping the vestibule as that of a queen, what, and what sort of veneration is due to you from us who are of creation the least, to you who art indeed a queen; to you, the living ark of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Lawgiver; to you, the heaven that contains Him who can be contained of none? For since you, O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> virgin,  hast dawned as a bright day upon the world and hast brought forth the Sun of Righteousness, that hateful horror of darkness has been chased away; the power of the tyrant has been broken, death has been destroyed, <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> swallowed up, and all enmity dissolved before the face of peace; noxious diseases depart now that <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> looks forth; and the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> has been filled with the pure and clear light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. To which things Solomon alludes in the Book of Canticles, and begins thus: <q>My beloved is mine, and I am his; he feeds among the lilies until the day break, and the shadows flee away.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062955"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse16">Song of Songs 2:16-17</a></span> Since then, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of gods has appeared in Sion, and the splendour of His beauty has appeared in Jerusalem; and <q>a light has sprung up for the righteous, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> for those who are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of heart.</q>  According to the blessed David, the Perfecter and Lord of the perfected  has, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, called the teacher and minister of the law to minister and testify of those things which were done.</p>

<p>VI. Hence the aged Simeon, putting off the weakness of the flesh, and putting on the strength of hope, in the face of the law hastened to receive the Minister of the law, the Teacher  with authority, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the Protector of Isaac, the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Instructor of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; Him, I say, who promised to show him His divine <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, as it were His hinder parts;<span class="stiki" id="note062959"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse23">Exodus 3:23</a></span> Him who, in the midst of poverty, was rich; Him who in infancy was before the ages; Him who, though seen, was invisible; Him who in comprehension was incomprehensible; Him who, though in littleness, yet surpassed all magnitude&mdash; at one and the same time in the temple and in the highest heavens&mdash; on a royal throne, and on the chariot of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> Him who is both above and below continuously Him who is in the form of a servant, and in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father; a subject, and yet King of all. He was entirely given up to desire, to hope, to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; he was no longer his own, but His who had been looked for. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> had announced to him the joyful tidings, and before he reached the temple, carried aloft by the eyes of his understanding, as if even now he possessed what he had longed for, he exulted with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Being thus led on, and in his haste treading the air with his steps, he reaches the shrine hitherto held sacred; but, not heeding the temple, he stretches out his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> arms to the Ruler of the temple, chanting forth in song such strains as become the joyous occasion: I long for You, O Lord God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast deigned, of Your own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and goodness, which provides for all, of Your gracious condescension, with which You incline towards us, as a Mediator bringing peace, to establish harmony between earth and heaven. I seek You, the Great Author of all. With longing I expect You who, with Your word, embracest all things. I wait for You, the Lord of life and death. For You I look, the Giver of the law, and the Successor of the law. I hunger for You, who quickenest the dead; I thirst for You, who refreshest the weary; I desire You, the Creator and Redeemer of the world.<span class="stiki" id="note062960"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse10">Isaiah 43:10</a></span> You are our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and You we adore; You are our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Temple, and in You we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; You are our Lawgiver, and You we <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>; You are God of all things the First.

For all things are placed under You as their Cause and Author, as He who brought all things into being out of nothing, and gave to what was unstable a firm coherence; as the connecting Band and Preserver of that which has been brought into being; as the Framer of things by nature different; as He who, with wise and steady hand, holds the helm of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; as the very Principle of all good order; as the irrefragable Bond of concord and peace.

<p>VII. While the old man was thus exultant, and rejoicing with exceeding great and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that which had before been spoken of in a figure by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother of God now manifestly fulfilled. For taking, as from a pure and undefiled altar, that coal living and ineffable, with man's flesh invested, in the embrace of her sacred hands, as it were with the tongs, she held Him out to that just one, addressing and exhorting him, as it seems to me, in words to this effect: Receive, O reverend senior, you of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the most excellent, receive the Lord, and reap the full fruition of that hope of yours which is not left widowed and desolate. Receive, you of men the most illustrious, the unfailing treasure, and those riches which can never be taken away. Take to your embrace, O you of men most wise, that unspeakable might, that unsearchable power, which can alone support you. Embrace, you minister of the temple, the Greatness <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, and the Strength incomparable. Fold yourself around Him who is the very life itself, and live, O you of men most venerable, Cling closely to incorruption and be renewed, O you of men most righteous. Not too bold is the attempt; shrink not from it then, O you of men most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. Satiate yourself with Him you have longed for, and take your delight in Him who has been given, or rather who gives Himself to you, O you of men most divine. Joyfully draw your light, O you of men most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, from the Sun of Righteousness, that gleams around you through the unsullied mirror of the flesh. Fear not His gentleness, nor let His clemency terrify you, O you of men most blessed. Be not afraid of His lenity, nor shrink from His kindness, O you of men most modest. Join yourself to Him with alacrity, and delay not to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him. That which is spoken to you, and held out to you, savours not of over-boldness. Be not then reluctant, O you of men the most decorous. The flame of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of my Lord does not consume, but illuminates you, O you of men most just. <span class="stiki" id="note062970"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse2">Exodus 3:2</a></span> Let the bush which set forth me in type, with respect to the verity of that fire which yet had no subsistence, teach you this, O you who art in the law the best instructed.<span class="stiki" id="note062971"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse21">Daniel 3:21</a></span> Let that furnace which was as it were a breeze distilling dew persuade you, O master, of the dispensation of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. Then, beside all this, let my womb be a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to you, in which He was contained, who in nought else was ever contained, of the substance of which the incarnate Word yet deigned to become incarnate. The blast <span class="stiki" id="note062972"><a href="../bible/exo019.htm#verse16">Exodus 19:16</a></span> of the trumpet does not now terrify those who approach, nor a second time does the mountain all on smoke <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> terror to those who draw near, nor indeed does the law punish relentlessly  those who would boldly touch. What is here present speaks of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to man; what is here apparent, of the Divine condescension. Thankfully, then, receive the God who comes to you, for He shall take away your iniquities, and thoroughly purge your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. In you, let the cleansing of the world first, as in type, have place. In you, and by you, let that justification which is of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> beforehand to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. You are worthy of the quickening <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>. You have made good use of the law. Use <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> henceforth. With the letter you have grown weary; in the spirit be renewed. Put off that which his old, and clothe yourself with that which is new. For of these matters I think not that you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>.</p>

<p>VIII. Upon all this that righteous man, waxing bold and yielding to the exhortation of the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the handmaid of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in regard to the things which pertain to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, received into his aged arms Him who in infancy was yet the Ancient of days, and blessed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said, <q>Lord, now let Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word: for my eyes have seen Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which You have prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Your people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062974"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse29">Luke 2:29-32</a></span> I have received from You a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> unmixed with pain. Receive me rejoicing, O Lord, and singing of Your mercy and compassion. You have given unto me this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of heart. I render unto You with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> my tribute of thanksgiving. I have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the power of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Since, for my sake, God of You begotten, in a manner ineffable, and without corruption, has become man. I have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the inexplicable greatness of Your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and care for us, for You have sent forth Your own bowels to come to our deliverance. Now, at length, I understand what I had from Solomon learned: <q>Strong as death is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: for by it shall the sting of death be done away, by it shall the dead see life, by it shall even death learn what death is, being made to cease from that dominion which over us he exercised. By it, also, shall the serpent, the author of our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, he taken captive and overwhelmed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062975"><a href="../bible/son008.htm#verse6">Song of Songs 8:6</a></span> You have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us, O Lord, Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>,  causing to spring up for us the plant of peace, and we shall no longer wander in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. You have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us, O Lord, that You have not unto the end overlooked Your servants; neither have You, O beneficent One, forgotten entirely the works of Your hands. For out of Your compassion for our low estate You have shed forth upon us abundantly that goodness of Yours which is inexhaustible, and with Your very nature cognate, having redeemed us by Your only begotten Son, who is unchangeably like to You, and of one substance with You; judging it unworthy of Your majesty and goodness to entrust to a servant the work of saving and benefiting Your servants, or to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that those who had offended should be reconciled by a minister. But by means of that light, which is of one substance with You, You have given light to those that sat in darkness  and in the shadow of death, in order that in Your light they might see the light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>;  and it has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to You, by means of our Lord and Creator, to fashion us again unto <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; and You have graciously given unto us a return to Paradise by means of Him who separated us from the joys of Paradise; and by means of Him who has power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> You have<span class="stiki" id="note062979"><a href="../bible/mar002.htm#verse10">Mark 2:10</a></span> blotted out the handwriting which was against us.<span class="stiki" id="note062980"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse4">Colossians 2:4</a></span> Lastly, by means of Him who is a partaker of Your throne and who cannot be separated from Your divine nature, You have given unto us the gift of reconciliation and access unto You with confidence in order that, by the Lord who recognises the sovereign authority of none, by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the subscribed sanction, as it were, of so many and such great blessings might constitute the justifying gifts of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to be certain and indubitable rights to those who have obtained mercy. And this very thing the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> before had announced in the words: No ambassador, nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but the Lord Himself saved them; because He loved them, and spared them, and He took them up, and exalted them.  And all this was, not of works of righteousness <span class="stiki" id="note062982"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse5">Titus 3:5</a></span> which we have done, nor because we loved You&mdash;for our first earthly forefather, who was honourably entertained, in the delightful abode of Paradise, despised Your divine and saving commandment, and was judged unworthy of that life-giving place, and mingling his seed with the bastard off-shoots of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he rendered it very weak&mdash;but You, O Lord, of Your own self, and of Your ineffable <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> toward the creature of Your hands, hast confirmed Your mercy toward us, and, pitying our estrangement from You, hast moved Yourself at the sight of our degradation <span class="stiki" id="note062983"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse9">John 4:9</a></span> to take us into compassion. Hence, for the future, a joyous festival is established for us of the race of Adam, because the first Creator of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> has become the Second Adam. And the brightness of the Lord our God has come down to sojourn with us, so that we see God face to face, and are saved Therefore, O Lord, I seek of You to be allowed to depart. I have seen Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; let me be delivered from the bent yoke of the letter. I have seen the King Eternal, to whom no other succeeds; let me be set free from this servile and burdensome chain. I have seen Him who is by nature my Lord and Deliverer; may I obtain, then, His decree for my deliverance. Set me free from the yoke of condemnation, and place me under the yoke of justification. Deliver me from the yoke of the curse, and of the letter that kills; <span class="stiki" id="note062984"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 3:6</a></span> and enrol me in the blessed company of those who, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of this Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son, who is of equal <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and power with You, have been received into the adoption of sons.</p>

<p>IX. Let then, says he, what I have thus far said in brief, suffice for the present as my offering of thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But what shall I say to you, O mother-virgin and virgin-mother? For the praise even of her who is not man's work exceeds the power of man. Wherefore the dimness of my poverty I will make bright with the splendour of the gifts of the spirits that around you shine, and offering to you of your own, from the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> meadows I will pluck a garland for your sacred and divinely crowned head. With your ancestral <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> will I greet you, O daughter of David, and mother of the Lord and God of David. For it were both base and inauspicious to adorn you, who in your own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> excellest with that which belongs unto another. Receive, therefore, O lady most benignant, gifts precious, and such as are fitted to you alone, O you who art exalted above all generations, and who, among all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, both visible and invisible, shinest forth as the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>. Blessed is the root of Jesse, and thrice blessed is the house of David, in which you have sprung up.  God is in the midst of you, and you shall not be moved, for the Most High has made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> the place of His tabernacle. For in you the covenants and oaths made of God unto the fathers have received a most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> fulfilment, since by you the Lord has appeared, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of hosts with us. That bush which could not be touched,<span class="stiki" id="note062986"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse2">Exodus 3:2</a></span> which beforehand shadowed forth your figure endowed with divine majesty, bare God without being consumed, who manifested Himself to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> just so far as He willed to be seen. Then, again, that hard and rugged rock,<span class="stiki" id="note062987"><a href="../bible/exo017.htm#verse6">Exodus 17:6</a></span> which imaged forth the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and refreshment which has sprung out from you for all the world, brought forth abundantly in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> out of its thirsty sides a healing draught for the fainting people. Yea, moreover, the rod of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> which, without culture, blossomed forth in fruit,<span class="stiki" id="note062988"><a href="../bible/num017.htm#verse8">Numbers 17:8</a></span> the pledge and earnest of a perpetual <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, furnished no contemptible <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of your supernatural child-bearing. <span class="stiki" id="note062989"><a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse4">Hebrews 9:4</a></span> What, moreover? Hath not the mighty <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> expressly declared, that on account of these types of you, hard to be understood,<span class="stiki" id="note062990"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse8">Exodus 25:8</a></span> he delayed longer on the mountain, in order that he might learn, O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> one, the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> that with you are connected? For being commanded to build the ark as a sign and similitude of this thing, he was not negligent in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> the command, although a tragic occurrence happened on his descent from the mount; but having made it in size five cubits and a half, he appointed it to be the receptacle of the law, and covered it with the wings of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, most evidently pre-signifying you, the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who hast conceived Him without corruption, and in an ineffable manner brought forth Him who is Himself, as it were, the very consistence of incorruption, and that within the limits of the five and a half circles of the world. On your account, and the undefiled Incarnation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Word, which by you had place for the sake of that flesh which immutably and indivisibly remains with Him for ever.<span class="stiki" id="note062991"><a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse4">Hebrews 9:4</a></span> The golden pot also, as a most certain type, preserved the manna contained in it, which in other cases was changed day by day, unchanged, and keeping fresh for ages. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Elijah <span class="stiki" id="note062992"><a href="../bible/2ki002.htm#verse11">2 Kings 2:11</a></span> likewise, as prescient of your <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and being emulous of it through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, bound around him the crown of that fiery life, being by the divine decree adjudged superior to death. You also, prefiguring his successor Elisha, <span class="stiki" id="note062993"><a href="../bible/sir048.htm#verse1">Sirach 48:1</a></span> having been instructed by a wise master, and anticipating your presence who wast not yet born, by certain sure indications of the things that would have place hereafter,  ministered help and healing to those who were in need of it, which was of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> beyond nature; now with a new cruse, which contained healing <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, curing the deadly waters, to show that the world was to be recreated by the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> manifested in you; now with unleavened meal, in type responding to your child-bearing, without being defiled by the seed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, banishing from the food the bitterness of death; and then again, by efforts which transcended nature, rising superior to the natural elements in the Jordan, and thus exhibiting, in signs beforehand, the descent of our Lord into Hades, and His wonderful deliverance of those who were held fast in corruption. For all things yielded and succumbed to that divine image which prefigured you.</p>

<p>X. But why do I digress, and lengthen out my discourse, giving it the rein with these varied illustrations, and that when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of your matter stands like a column before the eye, in which it were better and more profitable to luxuriate and delight in? Wherefore, bidding adieu to the spiritual narrations and wondrous <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> throughout all ages, I pass on to you who art always to be had in remembrance, and who boldest the helm, as it were, of this festival. </p>

<p>Blessed are you, all-blessed, and to be desired of all. Blessed of the Lord is your name, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, and grateful exceedingly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you that givest light to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. You are the circumscription, so to speak, of Him who cannot be circumscribed; the root <span class="stiki" id="note062996"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse1">Isaiah 40:1</a></span> of the most beautiful flower; the mother of the Creator; the nurse of the Nourisher; the circumference of Him who embraces all things; the upholder of Him<span class="stiki" id="note062997"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews 1:3</a></span> who upholds all things by His word; the gate through which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> appears in the flesh;<span class="stiki" id="note062998"><a href="../bible/eze044.htm#verse2">Ezekiel 44:2</a></span> the tongs of that cleansing coal;<span class="stiki" id="note062999"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse6">Isaiah 6:6</a></span> the bosom in small of that bosom which is all-containing; the fleece of wool,<span class="stiki" id="note063000"><a href="../bible/jdg006.htm#verse37">Judges 6:37</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of which cannot be solved; the well of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>,<span class="stiki" id="note063001"><a href="../bible/2sa023.htm#verse17">2 Samuel 23:17</a></span> that reservoir of life which David longed for, out of which the draught of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> gushed forth; the mercy-seat <span class="stiki" id="note063002"><a href="../bible/exo035.htm#verse17">Exodus 35:17</a></span> from which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto men; the spotless robe of Him who clothes Himself with light as with a garment.  You have lent to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who stands in need of nothing, that flesh which He had not, in order that the Omnipotent might become that which it was his good pleasure to be. What is more splendid than this? What than this is more sublime? He who fills earth and heaven, <span class="stiki" id="note063004"><a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse24">Jeremiah 23:24</a></span> whose are all things, has become in need of you, for you have lent to God that flesh which He had not. You have clad the Mighty One with that beauteous panoply of the body by which it has become possible for Him to be seen by my eyes. And I, in order that I might freely approach to behold Him, have received that by which all the fiery darts of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall be quenched.<span class="stiki" id="note063005"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse16">Ephesians 6:16</a></span> Hail! Hail! Mother and handmaid of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hail! Hail! You to whom the great Creditor of all is a debtor. We are all debtors to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to you He is Himself indebted.</p>

<p>For He who said, <q>Honour your father and your mother,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note063006"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse12">Exodus 20:12</a></span> will have most assuredly, as Himself willing to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by such <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, kept inviolate that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and His own decree towards her who ministered to Him that nativity to which He voluntarily stooped, and will have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> with a divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> her whom He, as being without a father, even as she was without a husband, Himself has written down as mother. Even so must these things be. For the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>  which we offer to you, O you most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and admirable habitation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are no merely useless and ornamental words. Nor, again, is your spiritual laudation mere secular trifling, or the shoutings of a false flattery, O you who of God art praised; you who to God gavest suck; who by nativity givest unto mortals their beginning of being, but they are of clear and evident <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But the time would fail us, ages and succeeding generations too, to render unto you your fitting salutation as the mother of the King Eternal, <span class="stiki" id="note063008"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse17">1 Timothy 1:17</a></span> even as somewhere the illustrious <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, teaching us how incomprehensible you are.  How great is the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and how large is the place of His possession! Great, and has none end, high and unmeasurable. For verily, verily, this prophetic oracle, and most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> saying, is concerning your majesty; for you alone hast been thought worthy to share with God the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; who hast alone borne in the flesh Him, who of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father was the Eternally and Only-Begotten. So do they <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> who hold fast to the pure <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. </p>

<p>XI. But for the time that remains, my most attentive hearers, let us take up the old man, the receiver of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> teacher, who has put in here, as it were, in safety from that virginal sea, and let us refresh him, both satisfied as to his divine longing, and conveying to us this most blessed theology; and let us ourselves follow out the rest of our discourse, directing our course unerringly with reference to our prescribed end, and that under the guidance of God the Almighty, so shall we not be found altogether unfruitful and unprofitable as to what is required of us. When, then, to these sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> had been jointly called, and that pair of just ones elected of God&mdash; Simeon, I mean, and Anna, bearing in themselves most evidently the images of both peoples&mdash; had taken their station by the side of that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and virginal throne&mdash;for by the old man was represented the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the law now waxing old; while the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> represents the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, which had been up to this point a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>&mdash;the old man, indeed, as personating the law, seeks dismissal; but the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, as personating the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, brought her joyous confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>  and spoke of Him to all that looked for redemption in Jerusalem, even as the things that were spoken of both have been appositely and excellently recorded, and quite in harmony with the sacred festival. For it was fitting and necessary that the old man who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> so accurately that decree of the law, in which it is said: Hear Him, and every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that will not hearken unto Him shall be cut off from His people,  should seek a peaceful discharge from the tutorship of the law; for in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it were insolence and presumption, when the king is present and addressing the people, for one of his attendants to make a speech over against him, and that to this man his subjects should incline their ears. It was necessary, too, that the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who had been increased with gifts beyond measure, should in festal strains return her thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and so the things which there took place were agreeable to the law. But, for what remains, it is necessary to inquire how, since the prophetic types and figures bear, as has been shown, a certain analogy and relation to this prominent feast, it is said that the house was filled with smoke. Nor does the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> say this incidentally, but with significance, speaking of that cry of the Thrice-Holy,  uttered by the heavenly seraphs. You will discover the meaning of this, my attentive hearer, if you do but take up and examine what follows upon this narration: For hearing, he says, you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing, you shall see, and not perceive.  When, therefore, the foolish Jewish children had seen the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> wonders which, as David sang, the Lord had performed in the earth, and had seen the sign from the depth  and from the height meeting together, without division or confusion; as also Isaiah had before declared, namely, a mother beyond nature, and an offspring beyond reason; an earthly mother and a heavenly son; a new taking of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> nature, I say, by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a child-bearing without marriage; what in creation's circuit could be more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and more to be spoken of than this! Yet when they had seen this it was all one as if they had not seen it; they closed their eyes, and in respect of praise were supine. Therefore the house in which they boasted was filled with smoke.</p>

<p>XII. And in addition to this, when besides the spectacle, and even beyond the spectacle, they heard an old man, very righteous, very worthy of credit, worthy also of emulation, inspired by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, a teacher of the law, honoured with the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, illustrious in the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, by the hope which he had conceived of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, extending the limits of life, and putting off the debt of death&mdash; when they saw him, I say, leaping for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, speaking words of good omen, quite transformed with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> of heart, entirely rapt in a divine and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>; who from a man had been changed into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> by a godly change, and, for the immensity of his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, chanted his hymn of thanksgiving, and openly proclaimed the <q>Light to lighten the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Your people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q>  Not even then were they willing to hear what was placed within their hearing, and held in veneration by the heavenly beings themselves; wherefore the house in which they boasted was filled with smoke. Now smoke is a sign and sure evidence of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; as it is written, <q>There went up a smoke in His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and fire from His countenance devoured; </q>  and in another place, <q>Amongst the disobedient people shall the fire burn,</q>  which plainly, in the revered <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, our Lord signified, when He said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>Behold your house is left unto you desolate.</q>  Also, in another place, <q>The king sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burnt up their city.</q>  Of such a nature was the adverse reward of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for their unbelief, which caused them to refuse to pay to the Trinity the tribute of praise. For after that the ends of the earth were sanctified, and the mighty house of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was filled, by the proclamation of the Thrice Holy, with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord, as the great waters cover the seas,  there happened to them the things which before had been declared, and the beginning of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> was confirmed by its issue, the preacher of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> signifying, as has been said, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as it were in an example, the dreadful destruction which was to come upon them, in the words: <q>In the year in which king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord</q>&mdash; Uzziah, doubtless, as an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, being taken as the representative of the whole <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> body&mdash; the head of which he certainly was&mdash; who also, paying the penalty due to his presumption, carried on his forehead, as upon a brazen <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, the divine vengeance engraved, by the loathsomeness of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, exhibiting to all the retribution of their loathsome impiety. Wherefore with divine wisdom did he, who had foreknowledge of these events, oppose the bringing in of the thankful Anna to the casting out of the ungrateful <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>. Her very name also pre-signifies the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ and God is justified in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For Anna is, by interpretation, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>XIII. But here, as in port, putting in the vessel that bears the ensign of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, let us reef the sails of our oration, in order that it may be with itself commensurate. Only first, in as few words as possible, let us salute the city of the Great King  together with the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as being present with them in spirit, and keeping holy-day with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the brethren most held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> there. Hail, you city of the Great King, in which the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> are consummated. Hail, you heaven upon earth, Sion, the city that is for ever faithful unto the Lord. Hail, and shine Jerusalem, for your light has come, the Light Eternal, the Light for ever enduring, the Light Supreme, the Light Immaterial, the Light of one substance with God and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the Light which is in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and in which is the Father; the Light which illumines the ages; the Light which gives light to mundane and supramundane things, Christ our very God. Hail, city sacred and elect of the Lord. Joyfully keep your festal days, for they will not multiply so as to wax old and pass away. Hail, you city most <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> things are spoken of you; your <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall be clothed with righteousness, and your <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall shout for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and your poor shall be satisfied with bread.  Hail! <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, O Jerusalem, for the Lord reigns in the midst of you.  That Lord, I say, who in His simple and immaterial Deity, entered our nature, and of the virgin's womb became ineffably incarnate; that Lord, who was partaker of nothing else save the lump of Adam, who was by the serpent tripped up. For the Lord laid not hold of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>  &mdash; those, I say, who fell not away from that beauteous order and rank that was assigned to them from the beginning. To us He condescended, that Word who was always with the Father co-existent God. Nor, again, did He come into the world to restore; nor will He restore, as has been imagined by some impious advocates of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who once fell from light; but when the Creator and Framer of all things had, as the most divine <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, laid hold of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and through him of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, He was made man for ever, and without change, in order that by His fellowship with us, and our joining on to Him, the ingress of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> into us might be stopped, its strength being broken by degrees, and itself as wax being melted, by that fire which the Lord, when He came, sent upon the earth.  Hail to you, you <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,  which has been planted in all the earth, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with us. Fear not, little flock, the storms of the enemy  for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom, and that you should tread upon the necks of your enemies.  Hail, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, you that wast once barren, and without seed unto godliness, but who hast now many children of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,  Hail, you people of the Lord, you chosen generation, you royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, you <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation, you peculiar people&mdash; show forth His praises who has called you out of darkness into His marvellous light; and for His mercies glorify Him. </p>

<p>XIV. Hail to you for ever, you virgin mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our unceasing <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, for unto you do I again return.  You are the beginning of our feast; you are its middle and end;  the pearl of great price that belongest unto the kingdom; the fat of every victim, the living altar of the bread of life. Hail, you treasure of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hail, you fount of the Son's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for man. Hail, you overshadowing mount  of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. You gleamed, sweet gift-bestowing mother, of the light of the sun; you gleamed with the insupportable fires of a most fervent charity, bringing forth in the end that which was conceived of you before the beginning, making manifest the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> hidden and unspeakable, the invisible Son of the Father&mdash; the Prince of Peace, who in a marvellous manner showed Himself as less than all littleness. Wherefore, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, the most excellent among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who boastest in the confidence of your maternal honours, that you would unceasingly keep us in remembrance. O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, remember us, I say, who make our boast in you, and who in <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> august celebrate the memory, which will ever live, and never fade away. And also, O honoured and venerable Simeon, you earliest host of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion, and teacher of the resurrection of the faithful, be our patron and advocate with that Saviour <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom you were deemed worthy to receive into your arms. We, together with you, sing our praises to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who has the power of life and death, saying, You are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light, proceeding from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light; the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, begotten of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the one Lord, before Your assumption of the humanity; that One nevertheless, after Your assumption of it, which is ever to be adored; God of Your own self and not by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but for our sakes also perfect man; in Your own nature the King absolute and sovereign, but for us and for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> existing also in the form of a servant. yet immaculately and without defilement. For You who are incorruption have come to set corruption free, that You might render all things uncorrupt. For Yours is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the power, and the greatness, and the majesty, with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
