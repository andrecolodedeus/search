<h1>Oration on the Psalms</h1>


<p>I. Blessed be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; let us proceed, brethren, from wonders to the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the Lord, and as it were, from strength to strength.  For just as in a golden chain the links are so intimately joined and connected together, as that the one holds the other, and is fitted on to it, and so carries on the chain&mdash; even so the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that have been handed down by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, one after the other, lead on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, which delights in festivity, and refresh it, not with the meat that perishes, but with that which endures unto everlasting life. <span class="stiki" id="note063037"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;6:27</a></span> Come then, beloved, and let us, too, with prepared hearts, and with ears intent, listen to what the Lord our God shall say unto us out of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> concerning this most sacred feast. Verily, He will speak peace unto His people, and to His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and to those which turn their hearts unto Him. Today,  the trumpet-blast of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have roused the world, and have made glad and filled with joyfulness the churches of God that are everywhere among the nations. And, summoning the faithful from the exercise of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and from the palaestra, wherein they struggle against the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the flesh, they have taught them to sing a new hymn of conquest and a new song of peace to Christ who gives the victory. Come then, every one, and let us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the Lord; O come, all you people, and let us clap our hands, and make a joyful noise to God our Saviour, with the voice of melody.  Let no one be without portion in this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; let no one come short of this calling; for the seed of the disobedient is appointed to destruction.&mdash; Let no one neglect to meet the King, lest he be shut out from the Bridegroom's chamber.&mdash; Let no one among us be found to receive Him with a sad countenance, lest he be condemned with those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> citizens&mdash; the citizens, I mean, who refused to receive the Lord as King over them. <span class="stiki" id="note063040"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse27">Luke&nbsp;19:27</a></span> Let us all come together cheerfully; let us all receive Him gladly, and hold our feast with all honesty. Instead of our garments, let us strew our hearts before Him,  In psalms and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, let us raise to Him our shouts of thanksgiving; and, without ceasing, let us exclaim, <q>Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord; </q>  for blessed are they that bless Him, and cursed are they that curse Him. <span class="stiki" id="note063043"><a href="../bible/gen027.htm#verse29">Genesis&nbsp;27:29</a></span> Again I will say it, nor will I cease exhorting you to good, Come, beloved, let us bless Him who is blessed, that we may be ourselves blessed of Him. Every age and condition does this discourse summon to praise the Lord; kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth; both young men and maidens  &mdash; and what is new in this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, the tender and innocent age of babes and sucklings has obtained the first place in raising to God with thankful confession the hymn which was of God taught them in the strains in which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> sang before to the people when they came forth out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>&mdash; namely, <q>Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord.</q></p>

<p>II. Today, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David rejoices with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, being by babes despoiled of his lyre, with whom also, in spirit, leading the dance, and rejoicing together, as of old, before the ark of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,<span class="stiki" id="note063045"><a href="../bible/2sa006.htm#verse14">2 Samuel 6:14</a></span> he mingles musical harmony, and sweetly lisps out in stammering voice, Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord. Of whom shall we inquire? Tell us, O <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, who is this that comes in the name of the Lord? He will say it is not my part today to teach you, for He has <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the school to infants, who has out of the mouth of babes and sucklings perfected praise to destroy the enemy and the avenger,  in order that by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of these the hearts of the fathers might be turned to the children, and the disobedient unto the wisdom of the just. <span class="stiki" id="note063047"><a href="../bible/mal004.htm#verse6">Malachi 4:6</a>; <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse17">Luke 1:17</a></span> Tell us, then, O children, whence is this, your beautiful and graceful contest of song? Who taught it you? Who instructed you? Who brought you together? What were your tablets? Who were your teachers? Do but you, they say, join us as our companions in this song and festivity, and you will learn the things which were by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> earnestly longed for.<span class="stiki" id="note063048"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse24">Luke 10:24</a></span> Since then the children have invited us, and have given unto us the right hand of fellowship,<span class="stiki" id="note063049"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse9">Galatians 2:9</a></span> let us come, beloved, and ourselves emulate that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> chorus, and with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, let us make way for Him who ascends over the heaven of heavens towards the East,  and who, of His good pleasure, is upon the earth mounted upon an ass's colt. Let us, with the children, raise the branches aloft, and with the olive branches make glad applaud, that upon us also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> may breathe, and that in due order we may raise the God-taught strain: <q>Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord; <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> in the highest.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note063051"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse5">Matthew 21:5</a></span> Today, also, the patriarch Jacob keeps feast in spirit, seeing his <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> brought to a fulfilment, and with the faithful adores the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, seeing Him who bound his foal to the vine <span class="stiki" id="note063052"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse10">Genesis 49:10</a></span> mounted upon an ass's colt. Today the foal is made ready, the irrational exemplar of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who before were irrational, to signify the subjection of the people of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; and the babes declare their former state of childhood, in respect of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and their after perfecting, by the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the exercise of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. Today, according to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>,  is the King of Glory <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> upon earth, and makes us, the inhabitants of earth, partakers of the heavenly feast, that He may show himself to be the Lord of both, even as He is hymned with the common praises of both. Therefore it was that the heavenly hosts sang, announcing <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> upon earth, <q>Holy, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, is the Lord God of hosts; the whole earth is full of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note063054"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse3">Isaiah 6:3</a></span> And those below, joining in harmony with the joyous <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of heaven, cried: <q><a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> in the highest; <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> to the Son of David.</q> In heaven the doxology was raised, <q>Blessed be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord from His place; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note063055"><a href="../bible/eze003.htm#verse22">Ezekiel 3:22</a></span> and on earth was this caught tip in the words, <q>Blessed is he. that comes in the name of the Lord.</q></p>

<p>III. But while these things were doing, and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were rejoicing and praising God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, saying, Blessed be the King that comes in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the highest; <span class="stiki" id="note063056"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse37">Luke 19:37-38</a></span> the city began to inquire, saying, Who is this?<span class="stiki" id="note063057"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse10">Matthew 21:10</a></span> stirring up its hardened and inveterate <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord. But when you hear me say the city, understand the ancient and disorderly multitude of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>. They ungratefully and malignantly ask, Who is this? As if they had never yet seen their Benefactor, and Him whom divine <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, beyond the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, had made famous and renowned; for the darkness comprehended not<span class="stiki" id="note063058"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse5">John 1:5</a></span> that unsetting light which shone in upon it. Hence quite appositely with respect to them has the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah exclaimed, saying, Hear, you deaf; and look, you blind, that you may see. And who is blind, but my children? And deaf, but they that have the dominion over them?<span class="stiki" id="note063059"><a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse18">Isaiah 42:18-20</a></span> And the servants of the Lord have become blind; you have often seen, but you observed not; your ears are opened, yet you hear not. See, beloved, how accurate are these words; how the Divine Spirit, who Himself sees beforehand into the future, has by His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> foretold of things future as if they were present. For these thankless men saw, and by means of His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> handled the wonder-working <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and yet remained in unbelief. <span class="stiki" id="note063060"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm">John 9</a></span> They saw a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, blind from his birth, proclaiming to them the God who had restored his sight. They saw a paralytic, who had grown up, as it were, and become one with his infirmity, at His bidding loosed from his disease.<span class="stiki" id="note063061"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse5">John 5:5</a></span> They saw Lazarus, who was made an exile from the region of death.<span class="stiki" id="note063062"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse44">John 11:44</a></span> They heard that He had walked on the sea.<span class="stiki" id="note063063"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse26">Matthew 14:26</a></span> They heard of the wine that, without previous culture, was ministered; <span class="stiki" id="note063064"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse7">John 2:7</a></span> of the bread that was eaten at that spontaneous banquet;<span class="stiki" id="note063065"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse11">John 6:11</a></span> they heard that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> had been put to flight; the sick restored to health  Their very streets proclaimed His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of wonder; their roads declared His healing power to those who journeyed on them. All <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> was filled with His benefit; yet now, when they hear the divine praises, they inquire, Who is this? O the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of these falsely-named teachers! O incredulous fathers! O foolish seniors! O seed of the shameless Canaan, and not of Judah the devout!<span class="stiki" id="note063067"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse56">Daniel 3:56</a></span> The children acknowledge their Creator, but their unbelieving <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> said, Who is this? The age that was young and inexperienced sang praises to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while they that had waxen old in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> inquired, Who is this? Sucklings praise His Divinity, while seniors utter <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>; children piously offer the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise, while profane <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are impiously indignant.<span class="stiki" id="note063068"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse15">Matthew 21:15</a></span></p>

<p>IV. O you disobedient as regards the wisdom of the just, <span class="stiki" id="note063069"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse17">Luke 1:17</a></span> turn your hearts to your children. Learn the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the very thing itself which is being done bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that it is God that is thus hymned by uninstructed tongues. Search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, as you have heard <span class="stiki" id="note063070"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse39">John 5:39</a></span> from the Lord; for they are they which testify of Him, and be not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. Hear you men without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and thankless, what good tidings the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Zechariah brings to you. He says, Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; behold your King comes unto you: just and having <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; lowly, and riding upon the foal of an ass. <span class="stiki" id="note063071"><a href="../bible/zec009.htm#verse9">Zechariah 9:9</a></span> Why do you repel the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>? Why, when the sun shines, do you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> darkness? Why do you against unconquerable peace meditate <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>? If, therefore, you be the sons of Zion, join in the dance together with your children. Let the religious service of your children be to you a pretext for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Learn from them who was their Teacher; who called them together; whence was the doctrine; what means this new theology and old <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. And if no man has taught them this, but of their own accord they raise the hymn of praise, then recognise the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even as it is written in the law: <q>Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings have You perfected praise.</q>  Redouble, therefore, your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that you have been made the fathers of such children who, under the teaching of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have celebrated with their praises things unknown to their seniors. Turn your hearts to your children,<span class="stiki" id="note063073"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse17">Luke 1:17</a></span> and close not your eyes against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But if you remain the same, and hearing, hear not, and seeing, perceive not,<span class="stiki" id="note063074"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse10">Isaiah 6:10</a></span> and to no purpose dissent from your children, then shall they be your judges <span class="stiki" id="note063075"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse27">Matthew 12:27</a></span> according to the Saviour's word. Well, therefore, even this thing also, together with others, has the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah spoken before of you, saying, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale. But when they see their children doing my works, they shall for me sanctify My name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. They also that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, and the stammering tongues shall learn to speak peace.  Do you see, O foolish Jew, how from the beginning of his discourse, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> declares confusion to you because of your unbelief. Learn even from him how he proclaims the God-inspired hymn of praise that is raised by your children, even as the blessed David has declared beforehand; saying, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings have You perfected praise. Either then&mdash;as is right&mdash;claim the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of your children for your own, or devoutly give your children unto us. We with them will lead the dance, and to the new <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> will sing in concert the divinely-inspired hymn.</p>

<p>V. Once, indeed, the aged Simeon met the Saviour <span class="stiki" id="note063077"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse29">Luke 2:29</a></span> and received in his arms, as an infant, the Creator of the world, and proclaimed Him to be Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but now, in the place of foolish elders, children meet the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, even as Simeon did, and instead of their arms, strew under Him the branches of trees, and bless the Lord God seated upon a colt, as upon the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> to the son of David: Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord; and together with these let us also exclaim, Blessed is He that comes, God the King of Glory, who, for our sakes, became poor, yet, in His own proper estate, being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of poverty, that with His bounty He might make us rich. Blessed is He who once came in humility, and who will hereafter come again in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: at the first, lowly, and seated upon an ass's colt, and by infants extolled in order that it might be fulfilled which was written: Your goings have been seen, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; even the goings of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my King, in the sanctuary; but at the second time seated on the clouds, in terrible majesty, by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and powers attended. O the mellifluous tongue of the children! O the sincere doctrine of those who are well pleasing to God! David in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> hid the spirit under the letter; children, opening their treasures, brought forth riches upon their tongues, and, in language full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, invited clearly all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to enjoy them. Therefore let us with them draw forth the unfading riches. In our bosoms insatiate, and in treasure-houses which cannot be filled, let us lay up the divine gifts. Let us exclaim without ceasing, Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord! Very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the name of the Very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Omnipotent from the Omnipotent, the Son in the name of the Father. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> King from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> King, whose kingdom, even as His who begot Him, is with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, coeval and pre-existent to it. For this is common to both; nor does the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> attribute this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as if it came from another source, nor as if it had a beginning, or could be added to or diminished&mdash; away with the thought!&mdash; but as that which is His of right by nature, and by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and proper possession. For the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, is one, even as their substance is one and their dominion one. Whence also, with one and the same adoration, we worship the one Deity in three Persons, subsisting without beginning, uncreate, without end, and to which there is no successor. For neither will the Father ever cease to be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor again the Son to be the Son and King, nor the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to be what in substance and personality He is. For nothing of the Trinity will suffer diminution, either in respect of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, or of communion, or of sovereignty. For not on that account is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> called king, because for our sakes He was made man, and in the flesh cast down the tyrant that was against us, having, by taking this upon Him, obtained the victory over its cruel enemy, but because He is always Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; therefore it is that now, both after His assumption of the flesh and for ever, He remains a king, even as He who begot Him. Speak not, O <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, against the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, lest you dishonour Him who begot Him. If you are faithful, in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> approach Christ, our very Cod, and not as using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness. If you are a servant, with trembling be subject unto your Master; for he who fights against the Word is not a well-disposed servant, but a manifest enemy, as it is written: He that honours not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, honours not the Father which has sent Him.</p>

<p>VI. But let us, beloved, return in our discourse to that point whence we digressed, exclaiming, Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord: that good and kind Shepherd, voluntarily to lay down His life for His sheep. That just as hunters take by a sheep the wolves that devour sheep, even so the Chief Shepherd, <span class="stiki" id="note063078"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse4">1 Peter 5:4</a></span> offering Himself as man to the spiritual wolves and those who destroy the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, may make His prey of the destroyers by means of that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> who was once preyed on by them. Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord: God against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; not manifestly in His might, which cannot be looked on, but in the weakness of the flesh, to bind the strong man <span class="stiki" id="note063079"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse29">Matthew 12:29</a></span> that is against us. Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord: the King against the tyrant; not with <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> power and wisdom, but with that which is accounted the foolishness <span class="stiki" id="note063080"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse21">1 Corinthians 1:21</a></span> of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, which has reft his spoils from the serpent who is wise in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord: the True One against the liar; the Saviour against the destroyer; the Prince of Peace <span class="stiki" id="note063081"><a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse6">Isaiah 9:6</a></span> against him who stirs up <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>; the Lover of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> against the hater of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord: the Lord to have mercy upon the creature of His hands. Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord: the Lord to save man who had wandered in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; to put away <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; to give light to those who are in darkness; to abolish the imposture of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; in its place to bring in the saving <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; to sanctify the world; to drive away the abomination and misery of the worship of false gods. Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord: the one for the many; to deliver the poor  out of the hands of them that are too strong for him, yea, the poor and needy from him that spoils him. Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord, to pour wine and oil upon him who had fallen among thieves, <span class="stiki" id="note063083"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse34">Luke 10:34</a></span> and had been passed by. Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord: to save us by Himself, as says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; no ambassador, nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but the Lord Himself saved us.<span class="stiki" id="note063084"><a href="../bible/isa063.htm#verse9">Isaiah 63:9</a></span> Therefore we also bless You, O Lord; You with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are blessed before the worlds and for ever. Before the world, indeed, and until now being devoid of body, but now and for ever henceforth possessed of that divine humanity which cannot be changed, and from which You are never divided.</p>

<p>VII. Let us look also at what follows. What says the most divine <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>? When the Lord had entered into the temple, the blind and the lame came to Him; and He healed them. And when the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children crying, and saying, <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> to the Son of David: Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note063085"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse14">Matthew 21:14-16</a></span> they brooked not this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> that was paid Him, and therefore they came to Him, and thus spoke, Do You not hear what these say? As if they said, Are You not grieved at hearing from these innocents things which befit <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God alone? Has not God of old made it manifest by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>My <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> will I not give unto another; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note063086"><a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse8">Isaiah 42:8</a></span> and how do You, being a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, make Yourself God? <span class="stiki" id="note063087"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse33">John 10:33</a></span> But what to this answers the long-suffering One, He who is abundant in mercy,<span class="stiki" id="note063088"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse13">Joel 2:13</a></span> and slow to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>?<span class="stiki" id="note063089"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse18">James 1:18</a></span> He bears with these frenzied ones; with an apology He keeps their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> in check; in His turn He calls the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> to their remembrance; He brings forward testimony to what is done, and shrinks not from inquiry. Wherefore He says, Have you never heard Me saying by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, Then shall you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am He that does speak?<span class="stiki" id="note063090"><a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse6">Isaiah 52:6</a></span> nor again, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings have You perfected praise because of Your enemies, that You might still the enemy and the avenger? Which without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> are you, who give heed unto the law, and read the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, while yet you despise Me who, both by the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, have been beforehand proclaimed. You think, indeed, under a pretence of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, to avenge the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not understanding that he that despises Me despises My Father also.<span class="stiki" id="note063091"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse23">John 15:23</a></span> I came forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have come into the world,<span class="stiki" id="note063092"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse28">John 16:28</a></span> and My <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of My Father also. Even thus these foolish ones, being convinced by our Saviour-<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ceased to answer Him again, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> stopping their mouths; but adopting a new and foolish device, they took counsel against Him. But let us sing, Great is our Lord, and great is His power;  and of His understanding there is no number. For all this was done that the Lamb and <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, that takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the world, might, of His own will, and for us, come to His saving Passion, and might be recognised, as it were, in the market and place of selling; and that those who bought Him might for thirty pieces of silver covenant for Him who, with His life-giving blood, was to redeem the world; and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, our passover, might be <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> for us, in order that those who were sprinkled with His precious blood, and sealed on their lips, as the posts of the door,<span class="stiki" id="note063094"><a href="../bible/exo011.htm#verse7">Exodus 11:7</a></span> might escape from the darts of the destroyer; and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> having thus suffered in the flesh, and having risen again the third day, might, with equal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be by all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things equally adored; for to Him every knee shall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth,<span class="stiki" id="note063095"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse10">Philippians 2:10</a></span> sending up <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to Him, for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
