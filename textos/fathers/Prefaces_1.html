<h1>Prefaces</h1>

<h2>Preface to the Chronicle of Eusebius</h2>

<div class="stiki"><p>The <q>Chronicle</q> is a book of universal history, giving the dates from the call of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the Olympiads. For an account of it the reader is referred to the article of Dr. Salmon in the <q>Dictionary of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Antiquities.</q> It was translated by Jerome in the years 381-82, at Constantinople, where he was staying for the Council. This Preface shows that Jerome was already becoming aware of the difficulties arising from the various versions of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of going back to the Hebrew.</p></div>

<p>Jerome to his friends  Vincentius and Gallienus, Greeting:</p>

<p>1. It has long been the practice of learned men to exercise their minds by rendering into Latin the works of Greek writers, and, what is more difficult, to translate the poems of illustrious authors though trammelled by the farther requirements of verse. It was thus that our Tully literally translated whole books of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>; and after publishing an edition of Aratus (who may now be considered a Roman) in hexameter verse, he amused himself with the economics of Xenophon. In this latter work the golden river of eloquence again and again meets with obstacles, around which its waters break and foam to such an extent that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> unacquainted with the original would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> they were reading Cicero's words. And no wonder! It is hard to follow another man's lines and everywhere keep within bounds. It is an arduous task to preserve felicity and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unimpaired in a translation. Some word has forcibly expressed a given thought; I have no word of my own to convey the meaning; and while I am seeking to satisfy the sense I may go a long way round and accomplish but a small distance of my journey. Then we must take into account the ins and outs of transposition, the variations in cases, the diversity of figures, and, lastly, the peculiar, and, so to speak, the native idiom of the language. A literal translation sounds absurd; if, on the other hand, I am <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to change either the order or the words themselves, I shall appear to have forsaken the duty of a translator.</p>

<p>2. So, my dear Vincentius, and you, Gallienus, whom I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> as my own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, I beseech you, whatever may be the value of this hurried piece of work, to read it with the feelings of a friend rather than with those of a critic. And I ask this all the more earnestly because, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, I dictated with great rapidity to my amanuensis; and how difficult the task is, the sacred records testify; for the old flavour is not preserved in the Greek version by the Seventy. It was this that stimulated Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion; and the result of their labors was to impart a totally different character to one and the same work; one strove to give word for word, another the general meaning, while the third desired to avoid any great divergency from the ancients. A fifth, sixth, and seventh edition, though no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to what authors they are to be attributed, exhibit so pleasing a variety of their own that, in spite of their being anonymous, they have won an authoritative position. Hence, some go so far as to consider the sacred writings somewhat harsh and grating to the ear; which arises from the fact that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of whom I speak are not aware that the writings in question are a translation from the Hebrew, and therefore, looking at the surface not at the substance, they shudder at the squalid dress before they discover the fair body which the language clothes. In fact, what can be more musical than the Psalter? Like the writings of our own Flaccus and the Grecian Pindar it now trips along in iambics, now flows in sonorous alcaics, now swells into sapphics, now marches in half-foot metre. What can be more lovely than the strains of Deuteronomy and Isaiah? What more grave than Solomon's words? What more finished than Job? All these, as <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> tell us, were composed in hexameters and pentameters, and so circulated among their own people. When we read these in Greek they have <em>some</em> meaning; when in Latin they are utterly incoherent. But if any one thinks that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of language does not suffer through translation, let him render Homer word for word into Latin. I will go farther and say that, if he will translate this author into the prose of his own language, the order of the words will seem ridiculous, and the most eloquent of poets almost dumb.</p>

<p>3. What is the drift of all this? I would not have you think it strange if here and there we stumble; if the language lag; if it bristle with consonants or present gaping chasms of vowels; or be cramped by condensation of the narrative. The most learned among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have toiled at the same task; and in addition to the difficulty which all experience, and which we have alleged to attend all translation, it must not be forgotten that a peculiar difficulty besets us, inasmuch as the history is manifold, is full of barbarous names, circumstances of which the Latins <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing, dates which are tangled knots, critical marks blended alike with the events and the numbers, so that it is almost harder to discern the sequence of the words than to come to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what is related.</p>

<p>[Here follows a long passage showing an arrangement according to which the dates are distinguished by certain colours as belonging to one or another of the kingdoms, the history of which is dealt with. This passage seems unintelligible in the absence of the coloured figures, and would be of no use unless the book with its original arrangement were being studied.]</p>

<p>I am well aware that there will be many who, with their customary fondness for universal detraction (from which the only escape is by writing nothing at all), will drive their fangs into this volume. They will cavil at the dates, change the order, impugn the accuracy of events, winnow the syllables, and, as is very frequently the case, will impute the negligence of copyists to the authors. I should be within my right if I were to rebut them by saying that they need not read unless they choose; but I would rather send them away in a calm state of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so that they may attribute to the Greek author the credit which is his due, and may recognize that any insertions for which we are responsible have been taken from other men of the highest repute. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that I have partly discharged the office of a translator and partly that of a writer. I have with the utmost fidelity rendered the Greek portion, and at the same time have added certain things which appeared to me to have been allowed to slip, particularly in the Roman history, which Eusebius, the author of this book, as it seems to me, only glanced at; not so much because of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, for he was a learned man, as because, writing in Greek, he thought them of slight importance to his countrymen. So again from Ninus and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, right up to the captivity of Troy, the translation is from the Greek only. From Troy to the twentieth year of Constantine there is much, at one time separately added, at another intermingled, which I have gleaned with great diligence from Tranquillus and other famous historians. Moreover, the portion from the aforesaid year of Constantine to the sixth consulship of the Emperor Valens and the second of Valentinianus is entirely my own. Content to end here, I have reserved the remaining period, that of Gratianus and Theodosius, for a wider historical survey; not that I am afraid to discuss the living freely and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfully</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God banishes the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of man; but because while our country is still exposed to the fury of the barbarians everything is in confusion.</p>

<h2>Preface to the Translation of Origen's Two Homilies on the Song of Songs</h2>

<p> <em>Written at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, a.d. 383.</em></p>

<p>Jerome to the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pope Damasus:</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, while in his other books he has surpassed all others, has in the Song of Songs surpassed himself. He wrote ten volumes upon it, which amount to almost twenty thousand lines, and in these he discussed, first the version of the Seventy Translators, then those of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, and lastly, a fifth version which he states that he found on the coast of Atrium, with such magnificence and fullness, that he appears to me to have realized what is said in the poem: <q>The king brought me into his chamber.</q> I have left that work on one side, since it would require almost boundless leisure and labour and money to translate so great a work into Latin, even if it could be worthily done; and I have translated these two short treatises, which he composed in the form of daily lectures for those who were still like babes and sucklings, and I have studied faithfulness rather than elegance. You can conceive how great a value the larger work possesses, when the smaller gives you such satisfaction.</p>

<h2>Preface to the Book on Hebrew Names</h2>

<p>The origin and scope of this book is described in the Preface itself. It was written in the year 388, two years after Jerome had settled at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. He had, immediately on arriving in Palestine, three years previously, set to work to improve his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Hebrew, with a view to his translation of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, which was begun in 391. This book, therefore, and the two which follow, may be taken as records of studies preparatory to the Vulgate.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>, the most erudite man among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, is declared by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> to have done what I am now doing; he set forth a book of Hebrew Names, classing them under their initial letters, and placing the etymology of each at the side. This work I originally proposed to translate into Latin. It is well known in the Greek world, and is to be found in all <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>. But I found that the copies were so discordant to one another, and the order so confused, that I judged it to be better to say nothing, rather than to write what would <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> be condemned. A work of this kind, however, appeared likely to be of use; and my friends Lupulianus and Valerianus  urged me to attempt it, because, as they thought, I had made some progress in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Hebrew. I, therefore, went through all the books of Scripture in order, and in the restoration which I have now made of the ancient fabric, I think that I have produced a work which may be found valuable by Greeks as well as Latins.</p>

<p>I here in the Preface beg the reader to take notice that, if he finds anything omitted in this work, it is reserved for mention in another. I have at this moment on hand a book of Hebrew Questions, an undertaking of a new kind such as has never until now been heard of among either the Greeks or the Latins. I say this, not with a view of arrogantly puffing up my own work, but because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how much labour I have spent on it, and wish to provoke those whose <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is deficient to read it. I recommend all those who wish to possess both that work and the present one, and also the book of Hebrew Places, which I am about to publish, to make no account of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and all their ebullitions of vexation. Moreover, I have added the meaning of the words and names in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, so that the fabric might receive its last touch and might stand complete. I wished also in this to imitate <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, whom all but the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> acknowledge as the greatest teacher of the Churches next to the Apostles; for in this work, which stands among the noblest monuments of his genius, he endeavoured as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to supply what <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>, as a Jew, had omitted.</p>

<h2>Preface to the Book on the Sites and Names of Hebrew Places</h2>

<p> <span class="stiki">Written A.D. 388.</span> </p>

<p>Eusebius, who took his second name from the blessed Martyr Pamphilus, after he had written the ten books of his <q>Ecclesiastical History,</q> the Chronicle of Dates, of which I published a Latin version, the book in which he set forth the names of the different nations and those given to them of old by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and by those of the present day, the topography of the land of Jud&aelig;a and the portions allotted to the tribes, together with a representation of Jerusalem itself and its temple, which he accompanied with a very short explanation, bestowed his labour at the end of his life upon this little work, of which the design is to gather for us out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> the names of almost all the cities, mountains, rivers, hamlets, and other places, whether they remain the same or have since been changed or in some degree corrupted. I have taken up the work of this admirable man, and have translated it, following the arrangement of the Greeks, and taking the words in the order of their initial letters, but leaving out those names which did not seem worthy of mention, and making a considerable number of alterations. I have explained my method once for all in the Preface to my translation of the Chronicle, where I said that I might be called at once a translator and the composer of a new work; but I repeat this especially because one who had hardly the first tincture of letters has ventured upon a translation of this very book into Latin, though his language is hardly to be called Latin. His lack of scholarship will be seen by the observant reader as soon as he compares it with my translation. I do not pretend to a style which soars to the skies; but I hope that I can rise above one which grovels on the earth.</p>

<h2>Preface to the Book of Hebrew Questions</h2>

<p> <span class="stiki">Written A.D. 388.</span> </p>

<p>The object of the Preface to a book is to set forth the argument of the work which follows; but I am compelled to begin by answering what has been said against me. My case is somewhat like that of Terence, who turned the scenic prologues of his plays into a defence of himself. We have a Luscius Lanuvinus, like the one who worried him, and who brought charges against the poet as if he had been a plunderer of the treasury. The bard of Mantua suffered in the same way; he had translated a few verses of Homer very exactly, and they said that he was nothing but a plagiarist from the ancients. But he answered them that it was no small <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of strength to wrest the club of Hercules from his hands. Why, even Tully, who stands on the pinnacle of Roman eloquence, that king of orators and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Latin tongue, has actions for embezzlement  brought against him by the Greeks. I cannot, therefore, be surprised if a poor little fellow like me is exposed to the gruntings of vile swine who trample our pearls under their feet, when some of the most learned of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, men whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> ought to have hushed the voice of ill will, have felt the flames of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, this happened by a kind of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to men whose eloquence had filled with its resonance the theatres and the senate, the public assembly and the rostra; hardihood always courts detraction, and (as Horace says):</p>

<blockquote><p>The  highest peaks invoke

<br>The lightning's stroke.
</p></blockquote>

<p>But I am in a corner, remote from the city and the forum, and the wranglings of crowded courts; yet, even so (as Quintilian says) ill-will has sought me out. Therefore, I beseech the reader,</p>

<blockquote><p>If  one there be, if one,

<br>Who, rapt by strong desire, these lines shall read,
</p></blockquote>

<p>not to expect eloquence or oratorical <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in those Books of Hebrew Questions, which I propose to write on all the sacred books; but rather, that he should himself answer my detractors for me, and tell them that a work of a new kind can claim some indulgence. I am poor and of low estate; I neither possess riches nor do I think it right to accept them if they are offered me; and, similarly, let me tell them that it is impossible for them to have the riches of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and the world's riches as well. It will be my simple aim, therefore, first, to point out the mistakes of those who suspect some fault in the Hebrew Scriptures, and, secondly, to correct the faults, which evidently teem in the Greek and Latin copies, by a reference to the original authority; and, further, to explain the etymology of things, names, and countries, when it is not apparent from the sound of the Latin words, by giving a paraphrase in the vulgar tongue. To enable the student more easily to take note of these emendations, I propose, in the first place, to set out the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>  reading itself, as I am now able to do, and then, by bringing the later readings into comparison with it, to indicate what has been omitted or added or altered. It is not my purpose, as snarling ill-will pretends, to convict the LXX. of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, nor do I look upon my own labour as a disparagement of theirs. The fact is that they, since their work was undertaken for King Ptolemy of Alexandria, did not choose to bring to light all the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> which the sacred writings contain, and especially those which give the promise of the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that he who held the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in esteem because they were <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to worship one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, would come to think that they worshipped a second. But we find that the Evangelists, and even our Lord and Saviour, and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, also, bring forward many citations as coming from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> which are not contained in our copies; and on these I shall dilate more fully in their proper places. But it is clear from this fact that those are the best mss. which most correspond with the authoritative words of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Add to this that <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, who gives the story of the Seventy Translators, reports them as translating only the five books of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; and we also acknowledge that these are more in harmony with the Hebrew than the rest. And, further, those who afterward came into the field as translators&mdash; I mean Aquila and Symmachus and Theodotion&mdash; give a version very different from that which we use. </p>

<p>I have but one word more to say, and it may calm my detractors. Foreign goods are to be imported only to the regions where there is a demand for them. Country people are not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to buy balsam, pepper, and dates. As to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, I say nothing. His name (if I may compare small things with great) is even more than my own the object of ill-will, because, though following the common version in his Homilies, which were spoken to common people, yet, in his Tomes,  that is, in his fuller discussion of Scripture, he yields to the Hebrew as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and, though surrounded by his own forces, occasionally seeks the foreign tongue as his ally. I will only say this about him: that I should gladly have his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, even if accompanied with all the ill-will which clings to his name, and that I do not care a straw for these shades and spectral ghosts, whose nature is said to be to chatter in dark corners and be a terror to babies.</p>

<h2>Preface to the Commentary on Ecclesiastes</h2>

<p><strong>Addressed to Paula and Eustochium, Bethlehem, a.d. 388.</strong></p>

<p>I remember that, about five years ago, when I was still living at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, I read Ecclesiastes to the saintly Blesilla,  so that I might provoke her to the contempt of this earthly scene, and to count as nothing all that she saw in the world; and that she asked me to throw my remarks upon all the more obscure passages into the form of a short commentary, so that, when I was absent, she might still understand what she read. She was withdrawn from us by her sudden death, while girding herself for our work; we were not counted worthy to have such an one as the partner of our life; and, therefore, <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> and <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>, I kept silence under the stroke of such a wound. But now, living as I do in the smaller community of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, I pay what I owe to her memory and to you. I would only point out this, that I have followed no one's authority. I have translated direct from the Hebrew, adapting my words as much as possible to the form of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, but only in those places in which they did not diverge far from the Hebrew. I have occasionally referred also to the versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, but so as not to alarm the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> student by too many novelties, nor yet to let my commentary follow the side streams of opinion, turning aside, against my conscientious conviction, from the fountainhead of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>Prefaces to the Vulgate Version of the New Testament</h2>

<p>This version was made at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> between the years 382 and 385. The only Preface remaining is that to the translation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, but Jerome speaks of, and quotes from, his version of the other parts also. The work was undertaken at the request and under the sanction of Pope Damasus, who had consulted Jerome in a.d. 383 on certain points of Scriptural criticism, and apparently in the same year urged him to revise the current Latin version by help of the Greek original. It is to be observed that Jerome's aim was <q>to revise the old Latin, and not to make a new version. When Augustine expressed to him his gratitude for 'his <em>translation</em> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>,' he tacitly corrected him by substituting for this phrase 'the <em>correction</em> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.' Yet, although he proposed to himself this limited object, the various forms of corruption which had been introduced were, as he describes, so numerous that the difference of the old and revised (Hieronymian) text is throughout clear and striking.</q> See article by Westcott in <q>Dictionary of <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>,</q> on the Vulgate, and Fremantle's article on Jerome in <q>Dictionary of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Biography.</q></p>

<h2>The Four Gospels</h2>

<p> <em>Addressed to Pope</em>  <em>Damasus, a.d. 383.</em></p>

<p>You urge me to revise the old Latin version, and, as it were, to sit in judgment on the copies of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which are now scattered throughout the whole world; and, inasmuch as they differ from one another, you would have me decide which of them agree with the Greek original. The labour is one of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but at the same time both perilous and presumptuous; for in judging others I must be content to be judged by all; and how can I dare to change the language of the world in its hoary old age, and carry it back to the early days of its infancy? Is there a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, learned or unlearned, who will not, when he takes the volume into his hands, and perceives that what he reads does not suit his settled tastes, break out immediately into violent language, and call me a forger and a profane person for having the audacity to add anything to the ancient books, or to make any changes or corrections therein? Now there are two consoling reflections which enable me to bear the odium&mdash; in the first place, the command is given by you who are the supreme <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; and secondly, even on the showing of those who revile us, readings at variance with the early copies cannot be right. For if we are to pin our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the Latin texts, it is for our opponents to tell us <em>which;</em> for there are almost as many forms of texts as there are copies. If, on the other hand, we are to glean the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from a comparison of <em>many</em>, why not go back to the original Greek and correct the mistakes introduced by inaccurate translators, and the blundering alterations of confident but <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> critics, and, further, all that has been inserted or changed by copyists more asleep than awake? I am not discussing the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, which was turned into Greek by the Seventy elders, and  has reached us by a descent of three steps. I do not ask what Aquila and Symmachus think, or why Theodotion takes a middle course between the ancients and the moderns. I am willing to let that be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> translation which had apostolic approval. I am now speaking of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. This was undoubtedly composed in Greek, with the exception of the work of Matthew the Apostle, who was the first to commit to writing the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and who published his work in Jud&aelig;a in Hebrew characters. We must confess that as we have it in our language it is marked by discrepancies, and now that the stream is distributed into different channels we must go back to the fountainhead. I pass over those manuscripts which are associated with the names of Lucian and Hesychius, and the authority of which is perversely maintained by a handful of disputatious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. It is obvious that these writers could not amend anything in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> after the labours of the Seventy; and it was useless to correct the New, for versions of Scripture which already exist in the languages of many nations show that their additions are false. I therefore promise in this short Preface the four <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> only, which are to be taken in the following order, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, as they have been revised by a comparison of the Greek manuscripts. Only early ones have been used. But to avoid any great divergences from the Latin which we are accustomed to read, I have used my pen with some restraint, and while I have corrected only such passages as seemed to convey a different meaning, I have allowed the rest to remain as they are.</p>

<p>The Preface concludes with a description of lists of words made by Eusebius and translated by Jerome, designed to show what passages occur in two or more of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>.</p>
