<h1>Prescription against Heretics</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. Introductory. Heresies Must Exist, and Even Abound; They are a Probation to Faith.</h2>

<p>The character of the times in which we live is such as to call forth from us even this admonition, that we ought not to be astonished at the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> (which abound)  neither ought their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to surprise us, for it was foretold that they should come to pass;  nor the fact that they subvert the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of some, for their final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is, by affording a trial to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to give it also the opportunity of being <q>approved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031853"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:19</a></span> Groundless, therefore, and inconsiderate is the offense of the many  who are scandalized by the very fact that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> prevail to such a degree. How great (might their offense have been) if they had not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>.  When it has been determined that a thing must by all means be, it receives the (final) <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for which it has its being. This secures the power through which it exists, in such a way that it is impossible for it not to have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Analogy Between Fevers and Heresies. Heresies Not to Be Wondered At: Their Strength Derived from Weakness of Men's Faith. They Have Not the Truth. Simile of Pugilists and Gladiators in Illustration.</h2>

<p>Taking the similar case  of fever, which is appointed a place among all other deadly and excruciating issues (of life) for destroying man: we are not surprised either that it exists, for there it is, or that it consumes man, for that is the purpose of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. In like manner, with respect to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, which are produced for the weakening and the extinction of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since we feel a dread because they have this power, we should first dread the fact of their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; for as long as they exist, they have their power; and as long as they have their power, they have their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But still fever, as being an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> both in its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>  and in its power, as all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, we rather loathe than wonder at, and to the best of our power guard against, not having its extirpation in our power. Some men prefer wondering at <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, however, which bring with them <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death and the heat of a stronger fire, for possessing this power, instead of avoiding their power when they have the means of escape: but <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> would have no power, if (men) would cease to wonder that they have such power. For it either happens that, while men wonder, they fall into a snare, or, because they are ensnared, they cherish their surprise, as if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> were so powerful because of some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which belonged to them. It would no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> be a wonderful thing that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should have any force of its own, were it not that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> are strong in those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are not strong in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In a combat of boxers and gladiators, generally speaking, it is not because a man is strong that he gains the victory, or loses it because he is not strong, but because he who is vanquished was a man of no strength; and indeed this very conqueror, when afterwards matched against a really powerful man, actually retires crest-fallen from the contest. In precisely the same way, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> derive such strength as they have from the infirmities of individuals&mdash; having no strength whenever they encounter a really powerful <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Weak People Fall an Easy Prey to Heresy, Which Derives Strength from the General Frailty of Mankind. Eminent Men Have Fallen from Faith; Saul, David, Solomon. The Constancy of Christ.</h2>

<p>It is usual, indeed, with <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of a weaker character, to be so built up (in confidence) by certain individuals who are caught by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, as to topple over into ruin themselves. How comes it to pass, (they ask), that this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> or that man, who were the most faithful, the most <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, and the most approved  in the church, have gone over to the other side? Who that asks such a question does not in fact reply to it himself, to the effect that men whom <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> have been able to pervert  ought never to have been esteemed <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, or faithful, or approved? This again is, I suppose, an extraordinary thing, that one who has been approved should afterwards fall back? Saul, who was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> beyond all others, is afterwards subverted by <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>.  David, a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man <q>after the Lord's own heart,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031861"><a href="../bible/1sa013.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;13:14</a></span> is guilty afterwards of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note031862"><a href="../bible/2sa011.htm">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;11</a></span> Solomon, endowed by the Lord with all <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and wisdom, is led into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note031863"><a href="../bible/1ki011.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;11:4</a></span> For to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> alone was it reserved to persevere to the last without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.  But what if a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, if a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, if a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, if a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, if a doctor, if even a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>,  have fallen from the rule (of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>), will <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> on that account appear to possess  the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Do we prove the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>  by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? No one is wise, no one is faithful, no one excels in dignity,  but the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; and no one is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> but he who perseveres even to the end. <span class="stiki" id="note031869"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;10:22</a></span> You, as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> any other man from the outside appearance. You think as you see. And you see as far only as you have eyes. But says (the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>), <q>the eyes of the Lord are lofty.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031870"><a href="../bible/jer032.htm#verse19">Jeremiah&nbsp;32:19</a></span> <q>Man looks at the outward appearance, but God looks at the heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031871"><a href="../bible/1sa016.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;16:7</a></span> <q>The Lord (beholds and) <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them that are His;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031872"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:19</a></span> and <q>the plant which (my heavenly Father) has not planted, He roots up;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031873"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;15:13</a></span> and <q>the first shall,</q> as He shows, <q>be last;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031874"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;20:16</a></span> and He carries <q>His fan in His hand to purge His threshing-floor.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031875"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;3:12</a></span> Let the chaff of a fickle <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fly off as much as it will at every blast of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, all the purer will be that heap of grain which shall be laid up in the garner of the Lord. Did not certain of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> turn back from the Lord Himself, <span class="stiki" id="note031876"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse66">John&nbsp;6:66</a></span> when they were offended? Yet the rest did not therefore think that they must turn away from following Him,  but because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He was the Word of Life, and had come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  they continued in His company to the very last, after He had gently inquired of them whether they also would go away. <span class="stiki" id="note031879"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse67">John&nbsp;6:67</a></span> It is a comparatively small thing,  that certain men, like Phygellus, and Hermogenes, and Philetus, and Hymen&aelig;us, deserted His apostle:  the betrayer of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was himself one of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. We are surprised at seeing His churches forsaken by some men, although the things which we suffer after the example of Christ Himself, show us to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. <q>They went out from us,</q> says (St. John,) <q>but they were not of us. If they had been of us, they would no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> have continued with us.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Warnings Against Heresy Given Us in the New Testament. Sundry Passages Adduced. These Imply the Possibility of Falling into Heresy.</h2>

<p>But let us rather be mindful of the sayings of the Lord, and of the letters of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; for they have both told us beforehand that there shall be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and have given us, in anticipation, warnings to avoid them; and inasmuch as we are not alarmed because they exist, so we ought not to wonder that they are capable of doing that, on account of which they must be shunned. The Lord teaches us that many <q>ravening wolves shall come in sheep's clothing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031883"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;7:15</a></span> Now, what are these sheep's clothing's, but the external surface of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> profession? Who are the ravening wolves but those deceitful senses and spirits which are lurking within to waste the flock of Christ? Who are the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> but deceptive predictors of the future? Who are the false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> but the preachers of a spurious gospel?  Who also are the Antichrists, both now and evermore, but the men who rebel against Christ?  Heresies, at the present time, will no less rend the church by their perversion of doctrine, than will <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> her at that day by the cruelty of his attacks,  except that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> make seven <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, (but) <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> only <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>. And therefore <q><a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> must needs be in order that they which are approved might be made manifest,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031887"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:19</a></span> both those who remained steadfast under <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and those who did not wander out of their way  into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. For <em>the apostle</em> does not mean  that those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should be deemed <em>approved</em> who exchange their creed for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; although they contrariously interpret his words to their own side, when he says in another passage, <q>Prove all things; hold fast that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>;</q>  as if, after proving all things amiss, one might not through <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> make a determined choice of some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Heresy, as Well as Schism and Dissension, Disapproved by St. Paul, Who Speaks of the Necessity of Heresies, Not as a Good, But, by the Will of God, Salutary Trials for Training and Approving the Faith of Christians.</h2>

<p>Moreover, when he blames dissensions and schisms, which undoubtedly are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, he immediately adds <em><a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a></em> likewise. Now, that which he subjoins to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, he of course confesses to be itself an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and all the greater, indeed, because he tells us that his belief of their schisms and dissensions was grounded on his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that <q>there must be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> also.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031891"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:19</a></span> For he shows us that it was owing to the prospect of the greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that he readily <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the lighter ones; and so far indeed was he from believing, in respect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> (of such a kind), that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> were good, that his object was to forewarn us that we ought not to be surprised at <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of even a worse stamp, since (he said) they tended <q>to make manifest all such as were approved;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031892"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:18</a></span> in other words, those whom they were unable to pervert.  In short, since the whole passage  points to the maintenance of unity and the checking of divisions, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> sever men from unity no less than schisms and dissensions, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he classes <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> under the same head of censure as he does schisms also and dissensions. And by so doing, he makes those to be <q>not approved,</q> who have fallen into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>; more especially when with reproofs he exhorts  men to turn away from such, teaching them that they should <q>all speak and think the selfsame thing,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031896"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:10</a></span> the very object which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> do not permit.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Heretics are Self-Condemned. Heresy is Self-Will, Whilst Faith is Submission of Our Will to the Divine Authority. The Heresy of Apelles.</h2>

<p>On this point, however, we dwell no longer, since it is the same <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> who, in his Epistle to the Galatians, counts <q><a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a></q> among <q>the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031897"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse20">Galatians&nbsp;5:20</a></span> who also intimates to Titus, that <q>a man who is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a></q> must be <q>rejected after the first admonition,</q> on the ground that <q>he that is such is perverted, and commits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as a self-condemned man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031898"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse10">Titus&nbsp;3:10-11</a></span> Indeed, in almost every epistle, when enjoining on us (the duty) of avoiding <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a>, he sharply condemns  <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. Of these the practical effects  are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a>, called in Greek <em><a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a></em>,  a word used in the sense of that <em>choice</em> which a man makes when he either teaches them (to others)  or takes up with them (for himself).  For this reason it is that he calls the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> <em>self-condemned</em>,  because he has himself chosen that for which he is condemned. We, however, are not permitted to cherish any object  after our own will, nor yet to make choice of that which another has introduced of his private fancy. In the Lord's <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> we possess our authority; for even they did not of themselves choose to introduce anything, but faithfully delivered to the nations (of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>) the doctrine  which they had received from Christ. If, therefore, even <q>an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from heaven should preach any other gospel</q> (than theirs), he would be called accursed  by us. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> had even then foreseen that there would be in a certain virgin (called) Philumene  an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of deceit, <q>transformed into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031909"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:14</a></span> by whose <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and illusions  <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a> was led (when) he introduced his new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Pagan Philosophy the Parent of Heresies. The Connection Between Deflections from Christian Faith and the Old Systems of Pagan Philosophy.</h2>

<p>These are <q>the doctrines</q> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <q>of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note031911"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:1</a></span> produced for itching ears of the spirit of this world's wisdom: this the Lord called <q>foolishness,</q>  and <q>chose the foolish things of the world</q> to confound even <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> itself. For (<a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>) it is which is the material of the world's wisdom, the rash interpreter of the nature and the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Indeed  <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> are themselves instigated  by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. From this source came the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> not what <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> forms,  and the trinity of man  in the system of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, who was of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> school. From the same source came <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> better god, with all his tranquillity; he came of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>. Then, again, the opinion that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> dies is held by the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>; while the denial of the restoration of the body is taken from the aggregate school of all the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; also, when matter is made equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then you have the teaching of Zeno; and when any doctrine is alleged touching a god of fire, then Heraclitus comes in. The same subject-matter is discussed over and over again  by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; the same arguments  are involved. Whence comes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? Why is it permitted? What is the origin of man? And in what way does he come? Besides the question which <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> has very lately proposed&mdash; Whence comes God? Which he settles with the answer: From <em>enthymesis</em> and <em>ectroma</em>.  Unhappy Aristotle! Who invented for these men dialectics, the art of building up and pulling down; an art so evasive in its propositions,  so far-fetched in its conjectures, so harsh, in its arguments, so productive of contentions&mdash; embarrassing  even to itself, retracting everything, and really treating of  nothing! Whence spring those <q>fables and endless genealogies,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031923"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:4</a></span> and <q>unprofitable questions,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031924"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse9">Titus&nbsp;3:9</a></span> and <q>words which spread like a cancer?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031925"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:17</a></span> From all these, when the apostle would restrain us, he expressly names <em><a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a></em> as that which he would have us be on our guard against. Writing to the Colossians, he says, <q>See that no one beguile you through <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain deceit, after the tradition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and contrary to the wisdom of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q>  He had been at Athens, and had in his interviews (with its <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>) become acquainted with that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom which pretends to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, while it only corrupts it, and is itself divided into its own manifold <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, by the variety of its mutually repugnant <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. What indeed has Athens to do with Jerusalem? What concord is there between the Academy and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? What between <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? Our instruction comes from <q>the porch of Solomon,</q>  who had himself taught that <q>the Lord should be sought in simplicity of heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031928"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse1">Wisdom&nbsp;1:1</a></span> Away with  all attempts to produce a mottled <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> of Stoic, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a>, and dialectic composition! We want no curious disputation after possessing Christ Jesus, no inquisition after enjoying the gospel! With our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we desire no further belief. For this is our palmary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that there is nothing which we ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> besides.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Christ's Word, Seek, and You Shall Find, No Warrant for Heretical Deviations from the Faith. All Christ's Words to the Jews are for Us, Not Indeed as Specific Commands, But as Principles to Be Applied.</h2>

<p>I come now to the point which (is urged both by our own brethren and by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>). Our brethren adduce <em>it</em> as a pretext for entering on curious inquiries,  and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> insist on it for importing the scrupulosity (of their unbelief).  It is written, they say, <q>Seek, and you shall find.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031932"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;7:7</a></span> Let us remember at what time the Lord said this. I think it was at the very outset of His teaching, when there was still a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> felt by all whether He were the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and when even Peter had not yet declared Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and John (Baptist) had actually ceased to feel assurance about Him.  With good reason, therefore, was it then said, <q>Seek, and you shall find,</q> when inquiry was still be to made of Him who was not yet become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Besides, this <em>was said</em> in respect of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For it is to them that the whole matter  of this reproof  pertains, seeing that they had (a revelation) where they might seek Christ.</p>

<p><q>They have,</q> says He, <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031936"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;16:29</a></span> &mdash; in other words, the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, which preach Christ; as also in another place He says plainly, <q>Search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, in which you expect (to find) <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; for they testify of me;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031937"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;5:39</a></span> which will be the meaning of <q>Seek, and you shall find.</q> For it is clear that the next words also apply to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: <q>Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031938"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;7:7</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had formerly been in covenant with  <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but being afterwards cast off on account of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, they began to be  without God. The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, on the contrary, had never been in covenant with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; they were only as <q>a drop from a bucket,</q> and <q>as dust from the threshing floor,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031941"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;40:15</a></span> and were ever outside the door. Now, how shall he who was always outside knock at the place where he never was? What door does he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of, when he has passed through none, either by entrance or ejection? Is it not rather he who is aware that he once lived within and was thrust out, that (probably) found the door and knocked thereat? In like manner, <q>Ask, and you shall receive,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031942"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;7:7</a></span> is suitably said  to one who was aware from whom he ought to ask&mdash;by whom also some promise had been given; that is to say, <q>the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, of Isaac, and of Jacob.</q> Now, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing either of Him, or of any of His promises. Therefore it was to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> that he spoke when He said, <q>I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031944"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;15:24</a></span> Not yet had He <q>cast to the dogs the children's bread;</q>  not yet did He charge them to <q>go into the way of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031946"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;10:5</a></span> It is only at the last that He instructs them to <q>go and teach all nations, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031947"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> when they were so soon to receive <q>the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the Comforter, who should guide them into all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031948"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;16:13</a></span> And this, too, makes towards the same conclusion. If the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who were ordained  to be teachers to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, were themselves to have the Comforter for their teacher, far more needless  was it to say to us, <q>Seek, and you shall find,</q> to whom was to come, without research,  our instruction  by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. All the Lord's sayings, indeed, are set forth for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; through the ears of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have they passed on to us. Still most of them were addressed to <em>Jewish</em> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>;  they therefore did not constitute instruction properly designed  for ourselves, but <em>rather</em> an example. </p>

<h2>Chapter 9. The Research After Definite Truth Enjoined on Us. When We Have Discovered This, We Should Be Content.</h2>

<p>I now purposely  relinquish this ground of argument. Let it be granted, that the words, <q>Seek, and you shall find,</q> were addressed to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> (equally). Yet even here one's aim is  carefully to determine  the sense of the words  consistently with  (that reason),  which is the guiding principle  in all interpretation. (Now) no divine saying is so unconnected  and diffuse, that its <em>words</em> only are to be insisted on, and their <em>connection</em> left undetermined. But at the outset I lay down (this position) that there is some one, and therefore definite, thing taught by Christ, which the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are by all means bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and for that purpose to <q>seek,</q> in order that they may be able, when they have <q>found</q> it, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. However,  there can be no indefinite seeking for that which has been taught as one only definite thing. You must <q>seek</q> until you <q>find,</q> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> when you have found; nor have you anything further to do but to keep what you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> provided you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this besides, that nothing else is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and therefore nothing else is to be sought, after you have found and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> what has been taught by Him who charges you to seek no other thing than that which He has taught.  When, indeed, any man doubts about this, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> will be forthcoming,  that we have in our possession  that which was taught by Christ. Meanwhile, such is my confidence in our <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, that I anticipate it, in the shape of an admonition to certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, not <q>to seek</q> anything beyond what they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>&mdash; that this is what they ought to have sought, how to avoid  interpreting, <q>Seek, and you shall find,</q> without regard to the rule of reason.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. One Has Succeeded in Finding Definite Truth, When He Believes. Heretical Wits are Always Offering Many Things for Vain Discussion, But We are Not to Be Always Seeking.</h2>

<p>Now the reason of this saying is comprised in three points: in the matter, in the time, in the limit.  In the matter, so that you must consider <em>what it is</em> you have to seek; in the time, <em>when</em> you have to seek; in the limit, <em>how long</em>. What you have <q>to seek,</q> then, is that which Christ has taught,  (and you must go on seeking) of course for such time as you fail to find, &mdash; until indeed you find  it. But you have succeeded in finding  when you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. For you would not have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> if you had not found; as neither would you have sought except with a view to find. Your object, therefore, in seeking <em>was</em> to find; and your object in finding <em>was</em> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. All further delay for seeking and finding you have prevented  by believing. The very fruit of your seeking has determined for you this limit. This boundary  has He set for you Himself, who is unwilling that you should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> anything else than what He has taught, or, therefore, even seek for it. If, however, because so many other things have been taught by one and another, we are on that account bound to go on seeking, so long as we are able to find anything, we must (at that rate) be ever seeking, and never <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> anything at all. For where shall be the end of seeking? Where the stop  in believing? Where the completion in finding? (Shall it be) with <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>? But even <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> proposes (to us the) maxim, <q>Seek, and you shall find.</q> (Then shall it be) with <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>? Well, but <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a>, too, will assail me with the same quotation; Hebion also, and Simon, and all in turn, have no other argument wherewithal to entice me, and draw me over to their side. Thus I shall be nowhere, and still be encountering  (that challenge), <q>Seek, and you shall find,</q> precisely as if I had no resting-place;  as if (indeed) I had never found that which Christ has taught&mdash; that which ought  to be sought, that which must needs  be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. After We Have Believed, Search Should Cease; Otherwise It Must End in a Denial of What We Have Believed. No Other Object Proposed for Our Faith.</h2>

<p>There is impunity in erring, if there is no delinquency; although indeed to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> it is itself an act of delinquency.  With impunity, I repeat, does a man ramble,  when he (purposely) deserts nothing. But yet, if I have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> what I was bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and then afterwards think that there is something new to be sought after, I of course expect that there is something else to be found, although I should by no means entertain such expectation, unless it were because I either had not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, although I apparently had become a believer, or else have ceased to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. If I thus desert my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, I am found to be a denier thereof. Once for all I would say, No man seeks, except him who either never possessed, or else has lost (what he sought). The old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> (in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>)  had lost one of her ten pieces of silver, and therefore she sought it; <span class="stiki" id="note031984"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;15:8</a></span> when, however, she found it, she ceased to look for it. The neighbour was without bread, and therefore he knocked; but as soon as the door was opened to him, and he received the bread, he discontinued knocking. <span class="stiki" id="note031985"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;11:5</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> kept asking to be heard by the judge, because she was not admitted; but when her suit was heard, thenceforth she was silent. <span class="stiki" id="note031986"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse2">Luke&nbsp;18:2-3</a></span> So that there is a limit both to seeking, and to knocking, and to asking. <q>For to every one that asks,</q> says He, <q>it shall be given, and to him that knocks it shall be opened, and by him that seeks it shall be found.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note031987"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;11:9</a></span> Away with the man  who is ever seeking because he never finds; for he seeks there where nothing can be found. Away with him who is always knocking because it will never be opened to him; for he knocks where there is none (to open). Away with him who is always asking because he will never be heard; for he asks of one who does not hear.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. A Proper Seeking After Divine Knowledge, Which Will Never Be Out of Place or Excessive, is Always Within the Rule of Faith.</h2>

<p>As for us, although we must still seek, and <em>that</em> always, yet where ought our search to be made? Amongst the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, where all things are foreign  and opposed to our own verity, and to whom we are forbidden to draw near? What slave looks for food from a stranger, not to say an enemy of his master? What soldier expects to get bounty and pay from kings who are unallied, I might almost say hostile&mdash; unless forsooth he be a deserter, and a runaway, and a rebel? Even that old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>  searched for the piece of silver within her own house. It was also at his neighbour's door that the persevering assailant kept knocking. Nor was it to a hostile judge, although a severe one, that the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> made her appeal. No man gets instruction  from that which tends to destruction.  No man receives illumination from a quarter where all is darkness. Let our <q>seeking,</q> therefore be in that which is our own, and from those who are our own: and concerning that which is our own&mdash;that, and only that,  which can become an object of inquiry without impairing the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Summary of the Creed, or Rule of Faith. No Questions Ever Raised About It by Believers. Heretics Encourage and Perpetuate Thought Independent of Christ's Teaching.</h2>

<p>Now, with regard to this rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash; that we may from this point  acknowledge what it is which we defend&mdash; it is, you must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that which prescribes the belief that there is one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that He is none other than the Creator of the world, who produced all things out of nothing through His own Word, first of all sent forth;  that this Word is called His Son, <em>and</em>, under the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was seen <q>in diverse manners</q> by the patriarchs, heard at all times in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, at last brought down by the Spirit and Power of the Father into the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, was made flesh in her womb, and, being born of her, went forth as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; thenceforth He preached the new law and the new promise of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; having been crucified, He rose again the third day; (then) having ascended  into the heavens, He sat at the right hand of the Father; sent instead of Himself  the Power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to lead such as <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; will come with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to take the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to the enjoyment of everlasting life and of the heavenly promises, and to condemn the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, after the resurrection of both these classes shall have happened, together with the restoration of their flesh. This rule, as it will be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, was taught by Christ, and raises among ourselves no other questions than those which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> introduce, and which make men <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Curiosity Ought Not Range Beyond the Rule of Faith. Restless Curiosity, the Feature of Heresy.</h2>

<p>So long, however, as its form exists in its proper order, you may seek and discuss as much as you please, and give full rein to  your curiosity, in whatever seems to you to hang in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, or to be shrouded in obscurity. You have at hand, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, some learned  brother gifted with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, some one of the experienced class, some one of your close acquaintance who is curious like yourself; although with yourself, a seeker he will, after all,  be quite aware  that it is better for you to remain in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, lest you should come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what you ought not, because you have acquired the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what you ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.  <q>Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> He says, <q>has saved you</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032004"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;18:42</a></span> not <em>observe</em> your skill  in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. Now, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has been deposited in the rule; it has a law, and (in the observance thereof) <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Skill,  however, consists in curious art, having for its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> simply the readiness that comes from knack.  Let such curious art give place to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; let such <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> yield to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. At any rate, let them either relinquish their noisiness,  or else be quiet. To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing in opposition to the rule (of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>), is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things. (Suppose) that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were not enemies to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so that we were not forewarned to avoid them, what sort of conduct would it be to agree with men who do themselves confess that they are still seeking? For if they are still seeking, they have not as yet found anything amounting to certainty; and therefore, whatever they seem for a while  to hold, they betray their own scepticism,  while they continue seeking. You therefore, who seek after their fashion, looking to those who are themselves ever seeking, a doubter to doubters, a waverer to waverers, must needs be <q>led, blindly by the blind, down into the ditch.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032011"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;15:14</a></span> But when, for the sake of deceiving us, they pretend that they are still seeking, in order that they may palm  their essays  upon us by the suggestion of an anxious sympathy, &mdash; when, in short (after gaining an access to us), they proceed at once to insist on the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of our inquiring into such points as they were in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of advancing, then it is high time for us in moral obligation  to repel  them, so that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is not Christ, but themselves, whom we disavow. For since they are still seekers, they have no fixed tenets yet;  and being not fixed in tenet, they have not yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; and being not yet <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, they are not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. But even though they have their tenets and their belief, they still say that inquiry is necessary in order to discussion.  Previous, however, to the discussion, they deny what they confess not yet to have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, so long as they keep it an object of inquiry. When men, therefore, are not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> even on their own admission,  how much more (do they fail to appear such) to us! What sort of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that which they patronize,  when they commend it to us with a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>? Well, but they actually  treat of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and recommend (their opinions) out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>! To be sure they do.  From what other source could they derive arguments concerning the things of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, except from the records of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Heretics Not to Be Allowed to Argue Out of the Scriptures. The Scriptures, in Fact, Do Not Belong to Them.</h2> 

<p>We are therefore come to (the gist of) our position; for at this point we were aiming, and for this we were preparing in the preamble of our address (which we have just completed)&mdash;so that we may now join issue on the contention to which our adversaries challenge us. They put forward  the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and by this insolence  of theirs they at once influence some. In the encounter itself, however, they weary the strong, they catch the weak, and dismiss waverers with a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Accordingly, we oppose to them this step above all others, of not admitting them to any discussion of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. </p>

<p>If in these lie their resources, before they can use them, it ought to be clearly seen to whom belongs the possession of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, that none may be admitted to the use thereof who has no title at all to the privilege.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. Apostolic Sanction to This Exclusion of Heretics from the Use of the Scriptures. Heretics, According to the Apostle, are Not to Be Disputed With, But to Be Admonished.</h2>

<p>I might be thought to have laid down this position to remedy distrust in my case,  or from a desire of entering on the contest  in some other way, were there not reasons on my side, especially this, that our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> owes deference  to the apostle, who forbids us to enter on <q>questions,</q> or to lend our ears to new-fangled statements, <span class="stiki" id="note032030"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:3-4</a></span> or to consort with a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> <q>after the first and second admonition,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032031"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse10">Titus&nbsp;3:10</a></span> not, (be it observed,) after discussion. Discussion he has inhibited in this way, by designating <em>admonition</em> as the purpose of dealing with a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, and the <em>first</em> one too, because he is not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; in order that he might not, after the manner of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, seem to require correction again and again, and <q>before two or three witnesses,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032032"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;18:16</a></span> seeing that he ought to be corrected, for the very reason that he is not to be disputed with; and in the next place, because a controversy over the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> can, clearly,  produce no other effect than help to upset either the stomach or the brain.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17. Heretics, in Fact, Do Not Use, But Only Abuse, Scripture. No Common Ground Between Them and You.</h2>

<p>Now this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of yours  does not receive certain Scriptures; and whichever of them it does receive, it perverts by means of additions and diminutions, for the accomplishment of it own purpose; and such as it does receive, it receives not in their entirety; but even when it does receive any up to a certain point  as entire, it nevertheless perverts even these by the contrivance of diverse interpretations. Truth is just as much opposed by an adulteration of its meaning as it is by a corruption of its text.  Their vain presumptions must needs refuse to acknowledge the (writings) whereby they are refuted. They rely on those which they have <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> put together, and which they have selected, because of  their ambiguity. Though most skilled  in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, you will make no progress,  when everything which you maintain is denied on the other side, and whatever you deny is (by them) maintained. As for yourself, indeed, you will lose nothing but your breath, and gain nothing but vexation from their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. Great Evil Ensues to the Weak in Faith, from Any Discussion Out of the Scriptures. Conviction Never Comes to the Heretic from Such a Process.</h2>

<p>But with respect to the man for whose sake you enter on the discussion of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>,  with the view of strengthening him when afflicted with doubts, (let me ask) will it be to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or rather to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> opinions that he will lean? Influenced by the very fact that he sees you have made no progress, while the other side is on an equal footing  (with yourself) in denying and in defence, or at any rate on a like standing  he will go away confirmed in his uncertainty  by the discussion, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> which side to adjudge <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. For, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, they too are able  to retort these things on us. It is indeed a necessary consequence that they should go so far as to say that adulterations of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and false expositions thereof, are rather introduced by ourselves, inasmuch as they, no less than we  maintain that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is on their side.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19. Appeal, in Discussion of Heresy, Lies Not to the Scriptures. The Scriptures Belong Only to Those Who Have the Rule of Faith.</h2>

<p>Our appeal, therefore, must not be made to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; nor must controversy be admitted on points in which victory will either be impossible,  or uncertain, or not certain enough.  But even if a discussion from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>  should not turn out in such a way as to place both sides on a par, (yet) the natural order of things would require that this point should be first proposed, which is now the only one which we must discuss: <q>With whom lies that very <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> belong.  From what and through whom, and when, and to whom, has been handed down that rule,  by which men become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>?</q> For wherever it shall be manifest that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rule and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall be,  <em>there</em> will likewise be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Scriptures and expositions thereof, and all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> traditions.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. Christ First Delivered the Faith. The Apostles Spread It; They Founded Churches as the Depositories Thereof. That Faith, Therefore, is Apostolic, Which Descended from the Apostles, Through Apostolic Churches.</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a> (may He bear with me a moment in thus expressing myself!), whosoever He is, of what God soever He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, of what substance soever He is man and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of what <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> soever He is the teacher, of what reward soever He is the Promiser, did, while He lived on earth, Himself declare what He was, what He had been, what the Father's will was which He was administering, what the duty of man was which He was prescribing; (and this declaration He made,) either openly to the people, or privately to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, of whom He had chosen the twelve chief ones to be at His side, <span class="stiki" id="note032051"><a href="../bible/mar004.htm#verse34">Mark&nbsp;4:34</a></span> and whom He destined to be the teachers of the nations. Accordingly, after one of these had been struck off, He commanded the eleven others, on His departure to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, to <q>go and teach <em>all</em> nations, who were to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and into the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and into the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032052"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> Immediately, therefore, so did the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, whom this designation indicates as <q> <em>the sent</em>.</q> Having, on the authority of a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, which occurs in a psalm of David,  chosen Matthias by lot as the twelfth, into the place of Judas, they obtained the promised power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> for the <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">gift of miracles</a> and of utterance; and after first bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> throughout Jud&aelig;a, and founding churches (there), they next went forth into the world and preached the same doctrine of the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the nations. They then in like manner founded churches in every city, from which all the other churches, one after another, derived the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,  and the seeds of doctrine, and are every day deriving them,  that they may become churches. Indeed, it is on this account only that they will be able to deem themselves apostolic, as being the offspring of <a href="../cathen/01634a.htm">apostolic churches</a>. Every sort of thing  must necessarily revert to its original for its classification.  Therefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, although they are so many and so great, comprise but the one primitive church, (founded) by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, from which they all (spring). In this way all are primitive, and all are apostolic, while they are all <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be one, in (unbroken) unity, by their peaceful communion,  and title of brotherhood, and bond  of hospitality&mdash;privileges  which no other rule directs than the one tradition of the selfsame <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 21. All Doctrine True Which Comes Through the Church from the Apostles, Who Were Taught by God Through Christ. All Opinion Which Has No Such Divine Origin and Apostolic Tradition to Show, is <em>Ipso Facto</em> False.</h2>

<p>From this, therefore, do we draw up our rule. Since the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> sent the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to preach, (our rule is) that no others ought to be received as preachers than those whom Christ appointed; for <q>no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father save the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032062"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span> Nor does the Son seem to have revealed Him to any other than the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, whom He sent forth to preach&mdash; that, of course, which He revealed to them. Now, what that was which they preached&mdash; in other words, what it was which Christ revealed to them&mdash; can, as I must here likewise prescribe, properly be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in no other way than by those very churches which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> founded in person, by declaring the gospel to them directly themselves, both <em>viv&acirc; voce</em>, as the phrase is, and subsequently by their epistles. If, then, these things are so, it is in the same degree  manifest that all doctrine which agrees with the <a href="../cathen/01634a.htm">apostolic churches</a>&mdash; those moulds  and original sources of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> must be reckoned for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as undoubtedly containing that which the (said) churches received from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> from Christ, Christ from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Whereas all doctrine must be prejudged  as false  which savours of contrariety to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the churches and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of Christ and God. It remains, then, that we demonstrate whether this doctrine of ours, of which we have now given the rule, has its origin  in the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and whether all other <em>doctrines</em> do not <em>ipso facto</em> proceed from <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. We hold communion with the <a href="../cathen/01634a.htm">apostolic churches</a> because our doctrine is in no respect different <em>from theirs</em>. This is <em>our</em> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22. Attempt to Invalidate This Rule of Faith Rebutted. The Apostles Safe Transmitters of the Truth. Sufficiently Taught at First, and Faithful in the Transmission.</h2>

<p>But inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is so near at hand,  that if it were at once produced there would be nothing left to be dealt with, let us give way for a while to the opposite side, if they think that they can find some means of invalidating this rule, just as if no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> were forthcoming from us. They usually tell us that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things: (but herein) they are impelled by the same <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, whereby they turn round to the very opposite point,  and declare that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all things, but did not deliver all things to all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>&mdash;in either case exposing Christ to blame for having sent forth <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> who had either too much <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, or too little simplicity. What man, then, of sound mind can possibly suppose that they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of anything, whom the Lord ordained to be masters (or teachers),  keeping them, as He did, inseparable (from Himself) in their attendance, in their discipleship, in their society, to whom, <q>when they were alone, He used to expound</q> all things <span class="stiki" id="note032072"><a href="../bible/mar004.htm#verse34">Mark&nbsp;4:34</a></span> which were obscure, telling them that <q>to them it was given to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> those <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032073"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;13:11</a></span> which it was not permitted the people to understand? Was anything withheld from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Peter, who is called <q>the rock on which the church should be built,</q>  who also obtained <q>the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>,</q>  with the power of <q>loosing and binding in heaven and on earth?</q>  Was anything, again, concealed from John, the Lord's most beloved <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, who used to lean on His breast <span class="stiki" id="note032077"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse20">John&nbsp;21:20</a></span> to whom alone the Lord pointed Judas out as the traitor,  whom He commended to Mary as a son in His own stead? <span class="stiki" id="note032079"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;19:26</a></span> Of what could He have meant those to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, to whom He even exhibited His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias, and the Father's voice moreover, from heaven? <span class="stiki" id="note032080"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;17:1-8</a></span> Not as if He thus disapproved  of all the rest, but because <q>by three witnesses must every word be established.</q>  After the same fashion,  too, (I suppose,) were they <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> to whom, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> also, He vouchsafed, as they were journeying together, <q>to expound all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032084"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse27">Luke&nbsp;24:27</a></span> No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>  He had once said, <q>I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot hear them now;</q> but even then He added, <q>When He, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, shall come, He will lead you into all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032086"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;16:12-13</a></span> He (thus) shows that there was nothing of which they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, to whom He had promised the future attainment of all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by help of the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And assuredly He fulfilled His promise, since it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the Acts of the Apostles that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> did come down. Now they who reject that Scripture  can neither belong to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, seeing that they cannot acknowledge that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has been sent as yet to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, nor can they presume to claim to be a church themselves  who positively have no means of proving when, and with what swaddling-clothes  this body was established. Of so much importance is it to them not to have any <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> for the things which they maintain, lest along with them there be introduced damaging exposures  of those things which they mendaciously devise.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23. The Apostles Not Ignorant. The Heretical Pretence of St. Peter's Imperfection Because He Was Rebuked by St. Paul. St. Peter Not Rebuked for Error in Teaching.</h2>

<p>Now, with the view of branding  the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> with some mark of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, they put forth the case of Peter and them that were with him having been rebuked by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. <q>Something therefore,</q> they say, <q>was wanting in them.</q> (This they allege,) in order that they may from this construct that other position of theirs, that a fuller <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> may possibly have afterwards come over (the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,) such as fell to the share of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> when he rebuked those who preceded him. I may here say to those who reject <em>The Acts of the Apostles</em>: <q>It is first necessary that you show us who this <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was&mdash;both what he was before he was an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, and how he became an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>,</q>&mdash; so very great is the use which they make of him in respect of other questions also. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that he tells us himself that he was a persecutor before he became an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note032092"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse13">Galatians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> still this is not enough for any man who examines before he believes, since even the Lord Himself did not bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Himself. <span class="stiki" id="note032093"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;5:31</a></span> But let them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> without the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, if their object is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> contrary to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>.  Still they should show, from the circumstance which they allege of Peter's being rebuked by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> added yet another form of the gospel besides that which Peter and the rest had previously set forth. But the fact is,  having been converted from a persecutor to a preacher, he is introduced as one of the brethren to brethren, by brethren&mdash; to them, indeed, by men who had put on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> hands. Afterwards, as he himself narrates, he <q>went up to Jerusalem for the purpose of seeing Peter,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032096"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse18">Galatians&nbsp;1:18</a></span> because of his office, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>,  and by right of a common belief and preaching. Now they certainly would not have been surprised at his having become a preacher instead of a persecutor, if his preaching were of something contrary; nor, moreover, would they have <q><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the Lord,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032098"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse24">Galatians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> because <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had presented himself as an adversary to Him. They accordingly even gave him <q>the right hand of fellowship,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032099"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse9">Galatians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> as a sign of their agreement with him, and arranged among themselves a distribution of office, not a diversity of gospel, so that they should severally preach not a different gospel, but (the same), to different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>,  Peter to the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Forasmuch, then, as Peter was rebuked because, after he had lived with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, he proceeded to separate himself from their company out of respect for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, the fault surely was one of conversation, not of preaching.  For it does not appear from this, that any other God than the Creator, or any other Christ than (the son) of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, or any other hope than the resurrection, was (by him) announced.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24. St. Peter's Further Vindication. St. Paul Not Superior to St. Peter in Teaching. Nothing Imparted to the Former in the Third Heaven Enabled Him to Add to the Faith. Heretics Boast as If Favoured with Some of the Secrets Imparted to Him.</h2>

<p>I have not the good fortune,  or, as I must rather say,  I have not the unenviable task,  of setting <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> by the ears.  But, inasmuch as our very perverse cavillers obtrude the rebuke in question for the set purpose of bringing the earlier  doctrine into suspicion, I will put in a defence, as it were, for Peter, to the effect that even <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said that he was <q>made all things to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>&mdash; to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a Jew,</q> to those who were not <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as one who was not a Jew&mdash; <q>that he might gain all.</q>  Therefore it was according to times and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and causes that they used to censure certain practices, which they would not hesitate themselves to pursue, in like conformity to times and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and causes. Just (<em>e.g.</em>) as if Peter too had censured <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, because, while forbidding <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, he actually <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> Timothy himself. Never mind  those who pass sentence on <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>! It is a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> fact that Peter is on the same level with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in the very <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>  of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Now, although <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was carried away even to the third heaven, and was caught up to paradise, <span class="stiki" id="note032110"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:4</a></span> and heard certain revelations there, yet these cannot possibly seem to have qualified him for (teaching) another doctrine, seeing that their very nature was such as to render them communicable to no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being.  If, however, that unspeakable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>  did leak out,  and become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to any man, and if any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> affirms that it does itself follow the same, (then) either <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> must be charged with having betrayed the secret, or some other man must actually  be shown to have been afterwards <q>caught up into paradise,</q> who had permission to speak out plainly what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was not allowed (even) to mutter.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25. The Apostles Did Not Keep Back Any of the Deposit of Doctrine Which Christ Had Entrusted to Them. St. Paul Openly Committed His Whole Doctrine to Timothy.</h2>

<p>But here is, as we have said,  the same <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, in their allowing indeed that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of nothing, and preached not any (doctrines) which contradicted one another, but at the same time insisting that they did not reveal all to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for that they proclaimed some openly and to all the world, while they disclosed others (only) in secret and to a few, because <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> addressed even this expression to Timothy: <q>O Timothy, guard that which is entrusted to you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032116"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:20</a></span> and again: <q>That good thing which was committed unto you keep.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032117"><a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:14</a></span> What is this deposit? Is it so secret as to be supposed to characterize  a new doctrine? Or is it a part of that charge of which he says, <q>This charge I commit unto you, son Timothy?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032119"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:18</a></span> and also of that precept of which he says, <q>I charge you in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who quickens all things, and before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> who witnessed a good confession under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, that you keep this commandment?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032120"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:13</a></span> Now, what is (this) commandment and what is (this) charge? From the preceding and the succeeding contexts, it will be manifest that there is no <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a>  hint darkly suggested in this expression about (some) far-fetched  doctrine, but that a warning is rather given against receiving any other (doctrine) than that which <em>Timothy</em> had heard from himself, <em>as I take it</em> publicly: <q>Before many witnesses</q> is his phrase. <span class="stiki" id="note032123"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:2</a></span> Now, if they refuse to allow that the church is meant by these <q>many witnesses,</q> it matters nothing, since nothing could have been secret which was produced <q>before many witnesses.</q> Nor, again, must the circumstance of his having wished him to <q>commit these things to faithful men, who should be able to teach others also,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032124"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:2</a></span> be construed into a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of there being some occult gospel. For, when he says <q>these things,</q> he refers to the things of which he is writing at the moment. In reference, however, to occult subjects, he would have called them, as being absent, <em>those things</em>, not <em>these things</em>, to one who had a joint <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them with himself. </p>

<h2>Chapter 26. The Apostles Did in All Cases Teach the Whole Truth to the Whole Church. No Reservation, Nor Partial Communication to Favourite Friends.</h2>

<p>Besides which, it must have followed, that, for the man to whom he committed the ministration of the gospel, he would add the injunction that it be not ministered in all places,  and without respect to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>,  in accordance with the Lord's saying, <q>Not to cast one's pearls before swine, nor that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> unto dogs.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032128"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span> Openly did the Lord speak, <span class="stiki" id="note032129"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse20">John&nbsp;18:20</a></span> without any intimation of a hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>.

Of no man, I am quite sure, were they afraid,&mdash; neither of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> nor of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in their <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>;  with all the greater freedom, then, would they certainly preach in the church, who held not their tongue in <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> and public places. Indeed they would have found it impossible either to convert <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or to bring in <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, unless they <q>set forth in order</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032134"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;1:1</a></span> that which they would have them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Much less, when churches were advanced in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, would they have withdrawn from them anything for the purpose of committing it separately to some few others. Although, even supposing that among intimate friends,  so to speak, they did hold certain discussions, yet it is incredible that these could have been such as to bring in some other rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, differing from and contrary to that which they were proclaiming through the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches, &mdash; as if they spoke of one God in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, (and) another at home, and described one substance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, publicly, (and) another secretly, and announced one hope of the resurrection before all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, (and) another before the few; although they themselves, in their epistles, besought men that they would all speak one and the same thing, and that there should be no divisions and dissensions in the church, <span class="stiki" id="note032137"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:10</a></span> seeing that they, whether <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> or others, preached the same things. Moreover, they remembered (the words): <q>Let your communication be yea, yea; nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than this comes of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032138"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;5:37</a></span> so that they were not to handle the gospel in a diversity of treatment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27. Granted that the Apostles Transmitted the Whole Doctrine of Truth, May Not the Churches Have Been Unfaithful in Handing It On? Inconceivable that This Can Have Been the Case.</h2>

<p>Since, therefore, it is incredible that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were either <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the whole scope of the message which they had to declare,  or failed to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the entire rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, let us see whether, while the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> proclaimed it, perhaps, simply and fully, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, through their own fault, set it forth otherwise than the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had done. All these suggestions of distrust  you may find put forward by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. They bear in mind how the churches were rebuked by the apostle: <q>O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032141"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;3:1</a></span> and, <q>You did run so well; who has hindered you?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032142"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse7">Galatians&nbsp;5:7</a></span> and how the epistle actually begins: <q>I marvel that you are so soon removed from Him, who has called you as His own in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to another gospel.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032143"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;1:6</a></span> That they likewise (remember), what was written to the Corinthians, that they <q>were yet carnal,</q> who <q>required to be fed with milk,</q> being as yet <q>unable to bear strong meat;</q>  who also <q>thought that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> somewhat, whereas they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not yet anything, as they ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032145"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:2</a></span> When they raise the objection that the churches were rebuked, let them suppose that they were also corrected; let them also remember those (churches), concerning whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and conversation the apostle <q>rejoices and gives thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> which nevertheless even at this day, unite with those which were rebuked in the privileges of one and the same institution.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28. The One Tradition of the Faith, Which is Substantially Alike in the Churches Everywhere, a Good Proof that the Transmission Has Been True and Honest in the Main.</h2>

<p>Grant, then, that all have erred; that the apostle was mistaken in giving his testimony; that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> had no such respect to any one (church) as to lead it into <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, although sent with this view by Christ, <span class="stiki" id="note032146"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;14:26</a></span> and for this asked of the Father that He might be the teacher of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note032147"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;15:26</a></span> grant, also, that He, the Steward of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Vicar of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,  neglected His office, permitting the churches for a time to understand differently, (and) to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> differently, what He Himself was preaching by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>&mdash;is it likely that so many churches, and they so great, should have gone astray into one and the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? No casualty distributed among many men issues in one and the same result. Error of doctrine in the churches must necessarily have produced various issues. When, however, that which is deposited among many is found to be one and the same, it is not the result of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but of tradition. Can any one, then, be reckless  enough to say that they were in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> who handed on the tradition?</p>

<h2>Chapter 29. The Truth Not Indebted to the Care of the Heretics; It Had Free Course Before They Appeared. Priority of the Church's Doctrine a Mark of Its Truth.</h2>

<p>In whatever manner <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> came, it reigned of course  only as long as there was an absence of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>? Truth had to wait for certain Marcionites and <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a> to set it free. During the interval the gospel was wrongly  preached; men wrongly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; so many thousands were wrongly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; so many works of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were wrongly wrought; so many miraculous gifts,  so many spiritual endowments,  were wrongly set in operation; so many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions, so many ministries,  were wrongly executed; and, to sum up the whole, so many <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> wrongly received their crowns! Else, if not wrongly done, and to no purpose, how comes it to pass that the things of God were on their course before it was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to what God they belonged? That there were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> before Christ was found? That there were <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> before <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine? Not so; for in all cases <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> precedes its copy, the likeness succeeds the reality. Absurd enough, however, is it, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> should be deemed to have preceded its own prior doctrine, even on this account, because it is that (doctrine) itself which foretold that there should be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> against which men would have to guard! To a church which possessed this doctrine, it was written&mdash; yea, the doctrine itself writes to its own church&mdash; <q>Though an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from heaven preach any other gospel than that which we have preached, let him be accursed.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 30. Comparative Lateness of Heresies. Marcion's Heresy. Some Personal Facts About Him. The Heresy of Apelles. Character of This Man; Philumene; Valentinus; Nigidius, and Hermogenes.</h2>

<p>Where was <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> <em>then</em>, that shipmaster of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> student of Stoicism? Where was <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> <em>then</em>, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Platonism? For it is evident that those men lived not so long ago&mdash;in the reign of <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus</a> for the most part, &mdash; and that they at first were <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">church of Rome</a> under the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of the blessed <a href="../cathen/05378a.htm">Eleutherus</a>,  until on account of their ever restless curiosity, with which they even infected the brethren, they were more than once expelled. <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, indeed, [went] with the two hundred sesterces which he had brought into the church, and,  when banished at last to a permanent excommunication, they scattered abroad the poisons of their doctrines. Afterwards, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> professed repentance, and agreed to the conditions granted to him&mdash; that he should receive reconciliation if he restored to the church all the others whom he had been training for perdition: he was prevented, however, by death. It was indeed  necessary that there should be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note032160"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:19</a></span> and yet it does not follow from that necessity, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> are a good thing. As if it has not been necessary also that there should be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>! It was even necessary that the Lord should be betrayed; but woe to the traitor! <span class="stiki" id="note032161"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse21">Mark&nbsp;14:21</a></span> So that no man may from this defend <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. If we must likewise touch the descent  of <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a>, he is far from being <q>one of the old school,</q>  like his instructor and moulder, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>; he rather forsook the continence of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, by resorting to the company of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and withdrew to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, out of sight of his most abstemious  master. Returning therefrom, after some years, unimproved, except that he was no longer a Marcionite, he clave  to another <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, the maiden Philumene (whom we have already  mentioned), who herself afterwards became an enormous prostitute. Having been imposed on by her vigorous spirit,  he committed to writing <em>the revelations</em> which he had learned of her. Persons are still living who remember them&mdash;their own actual <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and successors,&mdash; who cannot therefore deny the lateness of their date. But, in fact, by their own works they are convicted, even as the Lord said. <span class="stiki" id="note032168"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;7:16</a></span> For since <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> separated the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> from the Old, he is (necessarily) subsequent to that which he separated, inasmuch as it was only in his power to separate what was (previously) united. Having then been united previous to its separation, the fact of its subsequent separation proves the subsequence also of the man who effected the separation. In like manner <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, by his different expositions and acknowledged  emendations, makes these changes on the express ground of previous faultiness, and therefore demonstrates the difference  of the documents. These corrupters of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> we mention as being more notorious and more public  than others. There is, however, a certain man  named Nigidius, and Hermogenes, and several others, who still pursue the course  of perverting the ways of the Lord. Let them show me by what authority they come! If it be some other God they preach, how comes it that they employ the things and the writings and the names of that God against whom they preach? If it be the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why treat Him in some other way? Let them prove themselves to be new <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>!  Let them maintain that Christ has come down a second time, taught in person a second time, has been twice crucified, twice dead, twice raised! For thus has the apostle described (the order of events in the life of Christ); for thus, too, is He  accustomed to make His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>&mdash; to give them, (that is), power besides of working the same <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which He worked Himself.  I would therefore have their mighty <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> also brought forward; except that I allow their mightiest deed to be that by which they perversely vie with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For while they used to raise men to life from the dead, these consign men to death from their living state.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31. Truth First, Falsehood Afterwards, as Its Perversion. Christ's Parable Puts the Sowing of the Good Seed Before the Useless Tares.</h2>

<p>Let me return, however, from this digression  to discuss  the priority of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the comparative lateness  of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, deriving support for my argument even from that <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> which puts in the first place the sowing by the Lord of the good seed of the wheat, but introduces at a later stage the adulteration of the crop by its enemy the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> with the useless weed of the wild oats. For herein is figuratively described the difference of doctrines, since in other passages also the word of God is likened unto seed. From the actual order, therefore, it becomes clear, that that which was first delivered is of the Lord and is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, while that is strange and false which was afterwards introduced. This sentence will keep its ground in opposition to all later <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, which have no consistent quality of kindred <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>  inherent in them&mdash; to claim the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as on their side.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32. None of the Heretics Claim Succession from the Apostles. New Churches Still Apostolic, Because Their Faith is that Which the Apostles Taught and Handed Down. The Heretics Challenged to Show Any Apostolic Credentials.</h2>

<p>But if there be any (<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>) which are bold enough to plant themselves in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostolic</a> age, that they may thereby seem to have been handed down by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, because they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the time of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, we can say: Let them produce the original records  of their churches; let them unfold the roll of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, running down in due succession from the beginning in such a manner that [that first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of theirs ] <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall be able to show for his ordainer and predecessor some one of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> or of apostolic men,&mdash; a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, moreover, who continued steadfast with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For this is the manner in which the <a href="../cathen/01634a.htm">apostolic churches</a> transmit  their registers:  as the church of Smyrna, which records that <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> was placed therein by John; as also the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">church of Rome</a>, which makes Clement to have been ordained in like manner by Peter.  In exactly the same way the other churches likewise exhibit (their several worthies), whom, as having been appointed to their episcopal places by <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, they regard as transmitters of the apostolic seed. Let the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> contrive  something of the same kind. For after their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, what is there that is unlawful for them (to attempt)? But should they even effect the contrivance, they will not advance a step. For their very doctrine, after comparison with that of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, will declare, by its own diversity and contrariety, that it had for its author neither an apostle nor an apostolic man; because, as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> would never have taught things which were self-contradictory, so the apostolic men would not have inculcated teaching different from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, unless they who received their instruction from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> went and preached in a contrary manner. To this test, therefore will they be submitted for <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>  by those churches, who, although they derive not their founder from <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> or apostolic men (as being of much later date, for they are in fact being founded daily), yet, since they agree in the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they are accounted as not less apostolic because they are akin in doctrine.  Then let all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, when challenged to these two  tests by our apostolic church, offer their <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of how they deem themselves to be apostolic. But in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they neither are so, nor are they able to prove themselves to be what they are not. Nor are they admitted to peaceful relations and communion by such churches as are in any way connected with <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, inasmuch as they are in no sense themselves apostolic because of their diversity as to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 33. Present Heresies (Seedlings of the Tares Noted by the Sacred Writers) Already Condemned in Scripture. This Descent of Later Heresy from the Earlier Traced in Several Instances.</h2>

<p>Besides all this, I add a review of the doctrines themselves, which, existing as they did in the days of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, were both exposed and denounced by the said <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For by this method they will be more easily reprobated,  when they are detected to have been even then in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, or at any rate to have been seedlings  of the (tares) which then were. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in his first epistle to the Corinthians, sets his mark on certain who denied and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> the resurrection. <span class="stiki" id="note032193"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:12</a></span> This opinion was the special property of the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>.  A part of it, however, is maintained by <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a> and <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, and all other impugners of the resurrection. Writing also to the Galatians, he inveighs against such men as observed and defend <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the (Mosaic) law. <span class="stiki" id="note032195"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse2">Galatians&nbsp;5:2</a></span> Thus runs Hebion's <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.

(The apostle) directs a similar blow  against those who said that <q>the resurrection was past already.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032198"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:3</a></span> Such an opinion did the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a> assert of themselves. When again he mentions <q>endless genealogies,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032199"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:4</a></span> one also recognises <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, in whose system a certain <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>, whosoever he be,  of a new name, and that not one only, generates of his own <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>  Sense and Truth; and these in like manner produce of themselves Word  and Life, while these again afterwards beget Man and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. From these primary eight  ten other <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> after them spring, and then the twelve others arise with their wonderful names, to complete the mere story of the thirty <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>. The same apostle, when disapproving of those who are <q>in bondage to elements,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032204"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse9">Galatians&nbsp;4:9</a></span> points us to some dogma of Hermogenes, who introduces matter as having no beginning,  and then compares it with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has no beginning.  By thus making the mother of the elements a goddess, he has it in his power <q>to be in bondage</q> to a being which he puts on a par with  God. John, however, in the Apocalypse is charged to chastise those <q>who eat things <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>,</q> and <q>who commit fornication.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032208"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse14">Revelation&nbsp;2:14</a></span> There are even now another sort of <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaitans</a>. Theirs is called the Gaian  <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. But in his epistle he especially designates those as <q>Antichrists</q> who <q>denied that Christ had come in the flesh,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032210"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:3</a></span> and who refused to think that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. The one dogma <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> maintained; the other, Hebion.  The doctrine, however, of Simon's sorcery, which inculcated the worship of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,  was itself actually reckoned among idolatries and condemned by the Apostle Peter in Simon's own person.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34. No Early Controversy Respecting the Divine Creator; No Second God Introduced at First. Heresies Condemned Alike by the Sentence and the Silence of Holy Scripture.</h2>

<p>These are, as I suppose, the different kinds of spurious doctrines, which (as we are informed by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves) <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in their own day. And yet we find among so many various perversions of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not one school  which raised any controversy concerning God as the Creator of all things. No man was bold enough to surmise a second god. More readily was <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> felt about the Son than about the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, until <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> introduced, in addition to the Creator, another god of goodness only. <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a> made the Creator of some nondescript  <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, who belonged to the superior <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the god (according to him,) of the law and of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, affirming that he was fire.  <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> disseminated his <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, and traced the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;on</a>  to the production of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Creator. To none, forsooth, except these, nor prior to these, was revealed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Divine Nature; and they obtained this special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and fuller favour from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, we cannot <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>,  because he wished even in this respect to rival <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he might succeed, by the poison of his doctrines, in doing himself what the Lord said could not be done&mdash; making <q>the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> above their Master.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032218"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse40">Luke&nbsp;6:40</a></span> Let the entire mass  of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> choose, therefore, for themselves the times when they should appear, provided that the <em>when</em> be an unimportant point; allowing, too, that they be not of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and (as a matter of course ) that such as had no existence  in the time of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> could not possibly have had any connection with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. If indeed they had then <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, their names would be extant,  with a view to their own repression likewise. Those (<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>) indeed which did exist in the days of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, are condemned in their very mention.  If it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, then, that those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, which in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostolic</a> times were in a rude form, are now found to be the same, only in a much more polished shape, they derive their condemnation from this very circumstance. Or if they were not the same, but arose afterwards in a different form, and merely assumed from them certain tenets, then, by sharing with them an agreement in their teaching,  they must needs partake in their condemnation, by reason of the above-mentioned definition,  of lateness of date, which meets us on the very threshold.  Even if they were free from any participation in condemned doctrine, they would stand already judged  on the mere ground of time, being all the more spurious because they were not even named by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Whence we have the firmer assurance, that these were (the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>) which even then,  were announced as about to arise.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35. Let Heretics Maintain Their Claims by a Definite and Intelligible Evidence. This the Only Method of Solving Their Questions. Catholics Appeal Always to Evidence Traceable to Apostolic Sources.</h2>

<p>Challenged and refuted by us, according to these definitions, let all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> boldly on their part also advance similar rules to these against our doctrine, whether they be later than the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> or contemporary with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, provided they be different from them; provided also they were, by either a general or a specific censure, precondemned by them. For since they deny the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of (our doctrine), they ought to prove that it also is <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, refutable by the same rule as that by which they are themselves refuted; and at the same time to show us where we must seek the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which it is by this time evident has no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> among them. Our system  is not behind any in date; on the contrary, it is earlier than all; and this fact will be the evidence of that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which everywhere occupies the first place. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, again, nowhere condemn it; they rather defend it&mdash;a fact which will show that it comes from themselves.  For that doctrine which they refrain from condemning, when they have condemned every strange opinion, they show to be their own, and on that ground too they defend it.</p>

<h2 id="chapter36">Chapter 36. The Apostolic Churches the Voice of the Apostles. Let the Heretics Examine Their Apostolic Claims, in Each Case, Indisputable. The Church of Rome Doubly Apostolic; Its Early Eminence and Excellence. Heresy, as Perverting the Truth, is Connected Therewith.</h2>

<p>Come now, you who would indulge a better curiosity, if you would apply it to the business of your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, run over the <a href="../cathen/01634a.htm">apostolic churches</a>, in which the very thrones  of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> are still pre-eminent in their places,  in which their own authentic writings  are read, uttering the voice and representing the face of each of them severally. Achaia is very near you, (in which) you find <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>. Since you are not far from Macedonia, you have Philippi; (and there too) you have the Thessalonians. Since you are able to cross to Asia, you get Ephesus. Since, moreover, you are close upon <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>,  you have Rome, from which there comes even into our own hands the very authority (of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves).  How <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> is its church, on which <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> poured forth all their doctrine along with their blood! Where Peter endures a passion like his Lord's! Where <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> wins his crown in a death like John's  where the Apostle John was first plunged, unhurt, into boiling oil, and thence remitted to his island-exile! See what she has learned, what taught, what fellowship has had with even (our) churches in Africa!  One Lord God does she acknowledge, the Creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and Christ Jesus (born) of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> the Creator; and the Resurrection of the flesh; the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> she unites  in one volume with the writings of <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, from which she drinks in her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. This she seals with the water (of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>), arrays with the Holy Ghost, feeds with the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, cheers with <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>,  and against such a discipline thus (maintained) she admits no gainsayer. This is the discipline which I no longer say foretold that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> should come, but from  which they proceeded. However, they were not of her, because they were opposed to her.  Even the rough wild-olive arises from the germ  of the fruitful, rich, and genuine  olive; also from the seed  of the mellowest and sweetest fig there springs the empty and useless wild-fig. In the same way <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, too, come from our plant,  although not of our kind; (they come) from the grain of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,  but, owing to their <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, they have only wild leaves to show. </p>

<h2>Chapter 37. Heretics Not Being Christians, But Rather Perverters of Christ's Teaching, May Not Claim the Christian Scriptures. These are a Deposit, Committed to and Carefully Kept by the Church.</h2>

<p>Since this is the case, in order that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may be adjudged to belong to us, <q>as many as walk according to the rule,</q> which the church has handed down from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> from Christ, <em>and</em> Christ from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the reason of our position is clear, when it determines that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> ought not to be allowed to challenge an appeal to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, since we, without the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, prove that they have nothing to do with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. For as they are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, they cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, because it is not from Christ that they get that which they pursue of their own mere choice, and from the pursuit incur and admit the name of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.  Thus, not being <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, they have acquired  no right to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Scriptures; and it may be very fairly said to them, <q>Who are you? When and whence did you come? As you are none of mine, what have you to do with that which is mine? Indeed, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, by what right do you hew my wood? By whose permission, <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, are you diverting the streams of my fountain? By what power, <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a>, are you removing my landmarks? This is my property. Why are you, the rest, sowing and feeding here at your own pleasure? This (I say) is my property. I have long possessed it; I possessed it before you. I hold sure title-<a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> from the original owners themselves, to whom the estate belonged. I am the heir of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Just as they carefully prepared their will and testament, and committed it to a trust, and adjured (the trustees to be faithful to their charge),  even so do I hold it. As for you, they have, it is certain, always held you as disinherited, and rejected you as strangers&mdash; as enemies. But on what ground are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> strangers and enemies to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, if it be not from the difference of their teaching, which each individual of his own mere will has either advanced or received in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 38. Harmony of the Church and the Scriptures. Heretics Have Tampered with the Scriptures, and Mutilated, and Altered Them. Catholics Never Change the Scriptures, Which Always Testify for Them.</h2>

<p>Where diversity of doctrine is found, <em>there</em>, then, must the corruption both of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and the expositions thereof be regarded as existing. On those whose purpose it was to teach differently, lay the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of differently arranging the instruments of doctrine.  They could not possibly have effected their diversity of teaching in any other way than by having a difference in the means whereby they taught. As in their case, corruption in doctrine could not possibly have succeeded without a corruption also of its instruments, so to ourselves also integrity of doctrine could not have accrued, without integrity in those means by which doctrine is managed. Now, what is there in our Scriptures which is contrary to us?  What of our own have we introduced, that we should have to take it away again, or else add to it, or alter it, in order to restore to its natural soundness anything which is contrary to it, and contained in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>?  What we are ourselves, that also the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are (and have been) from the beginning.  Of them we have our being, before there was any other way, before they were interpolated by you. Now, inasmuch as all interpolation must be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be a later process, for the express reason that it proceeds from rivalry which is never in any case previous to nor home-born  with that which it emulates, it is as incredible to every man of sense that we should seem to have introduced any corrupt text into the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, existing, as we have been, from the very first, and being the first, as it is that they have not in fact introduced it who are both later in date and opposed (to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>). One man perverts the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> with his hand, another their meaning by his exposition. For although <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> seems to use the entire volume,  he has none the less laid violent hands on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> only with a more cunning mind and skill  than <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>. <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> expressly and openly used the knife, not the pen, since he made such an excision of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> as suited his own subject-matter.  <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, however, abstained from such excision, because he did not invent Scriptures to square with his own subject-matter, but adapted his matter to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; and yet he took away more, and added more, by removing the proper meaning of every particular word, and adding fantastic arrangements of things which have no real <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 39. What St. Paul Calls Spiritual Wickednesses Displayed by Pagan Authors, and by Heretics, in No Dissimilar Manner. Holy Scripture Especially Liable to Heretical Manipulation. Affords Material for Heresies, Just as Virgil Has Been the Groundwork of Literary Plagiarisms, Different in Purport from the Original.</h2>

<p>These were the ingenious arts of <q>spiritual wickednesses,</q>  wherewith we also, my brethren, may fairly expect to have <q>to wrestle,</q> as necessary for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that the elect may be made manifest, (and) that the reprobate may be discovered. And therefore they possess influence, and a facility in thinking out and fabricating  <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, which ought not to be wondered at as if it were a difficult and inexplicable process, seeing that in profane writings also an example comes ready to hand of a similar facility. You see in our own day, composed out of Virgil,  a story of a wholly different character, the subject-matter being arranged according to the verse, and the verse according to the subject-matter. In short,  Hosidius Geta has most completely pilfered his tragedy of <em>Medea</em> from Virgil. A near relative of my own, among some leisure productions  of his pen, has composed out of the same poet <em>The Table of Cebes</em>. On the same principle, those <em>poetasters</em> are commonly called <em>Homerocentones</em>, <q>collectors of Homeric odds and ends,</q> who stitch into one piece, patchwork fashion, works of their own from the lines of Homer, out of many scraps put together from this passage and from that (in miscellaneous confusion). Now, unquestionably, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a> are more fruitful in resources of all kinds for this sort of facility. Nor do I risk contradiction in saying  that the very Scriptures were even arranged by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in such a manner as to furnish materials for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, inasmuch as I read that <q>there must be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032265"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:19</a></span> which there cannot be without the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40. No Difference in the Spirit of Idolatry and of Heresy. In the Rites of Idolatry, Satan Imitated and Distorted the Divine Institutions of the Older Scriptures. The Christian Scriptures Corrupted by Him in the Perversions of the Various Heretics.</h2>

<p>The question will arise, By whom is to be interpreted  the sense of the passages which make for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>? By the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, of course, to whom pertain those wiles which pervert the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and who, by the mystic <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of his <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, vies even with the essential portions  of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  He, too, baptizes some&mdash; that is, his own <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> and faithful followers;  he promises the putting away  of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by a laver (of his own); and if my memory still serves me, <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithra</a> there, (in the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>,) sets his marks on the foreheads of his soldiers; celebrates also the oblation of bread, and introduces an image of a resurrection ,  and before a sword wreathes a crown.  What also must we say to (<a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan's</a>) limiting his chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>  to a single marriage? He, too, has his <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>; he, too, has his proficients in continence.  Suppose now we revolve in our minds the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a> of Numa Pompilius, and consider his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> offices and badges and privileges, his sacrificial services, too, and the instruments and vessels of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> themselves, and the curious <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of his expiations and vows: is it not clear to us that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> imitated the well-known  moroseness of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish law</a>? Since, therefore he has shown such emulation in his great aim of expressing, in the concerns of his <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, those very things of which consists the administration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, it follows, of course, that the same being, possessing still the same genius, both set his heart upon,  and succeeded in, adapting  to his profane and rival creed the very documents of divine things and of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> &mdash; his interpretation from their interpretations, his words from their words, his <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> from their <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>. For this reason, then, no one ought to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, either that <q>spiritual wickednesses,</q> from which also <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> come, have been introduced by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, or that there is any real difference between <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, seeing that they appertain both to the same author and the same work that <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> does. They either pretend that there is another god in opposition to the Creator, or, even if they acknowledge that the Creator is the one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they treat of Him as a different being from what He is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The consequence is, that every lie which they speak of God is in a certain sense a sort of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 41. The Conduct of Heretics: Its Frivolity, Worldliness, and Irregularity. The Notorious Wantonness of Their Women.</h2>

<p>I must not omit an account of the conduct  also of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>&mdash; how frivolous it is, how worldly, how merely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, without seriousness, without authority, without discipline, as suits their creed. To begin with, it is doubtful who is a catechumen, and who a believer; they have all access alike, they hear alike, they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> alike&mdash; even <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, if any such happen to come among them. <q>That which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> they will cast to the dogs, and their pearls,</q> although (to be sure) they are not real ones, <q>they will fling to the swine.</q>  Simplicity they will have to consist in the overthrow of discipline, attention to which on our part they call brothelry.  Peace also they huddle up  anyhow with all comers; for it matters not to them, however different be their treatment of subjects, provided only they can conspire together to storm the citadel of the one only Truth. All are puffed up, all offer you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> are perfect before they are full-taught.  The very <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, how wanton they are! For they are bold enough to teach, to dispute, to enact exorcisms, to undertake  cures&mdash; it may be even to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>.  Their ordinations, are carelessly administered,  capricious, changeable.  At one time they put <em>novices</em> in office; at another time, men who are bound to some secular employment;  at another, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> from us, to bind them by vainglory, since they cannot by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Nowhere is promotion easier than in the camp of rebels, where the mere fact of being there is a foremost service.  And so it comes to pass that today one man is their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, tomorrow another; today he is a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who tomorrow is a reader; today he is a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> who tomorrow is a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. For even on <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> do they impose the functions of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 42. Heretics Work to Pull Down and to Destroy, Not to Edify and Elevate. Heretics Do Not Adhere Even to Their Own Traditions, But Harbour Dissent Even from Their Own Founders.</h2>

<p>But what shall I say concerning the ministry of the word, since they make it their business not to convert the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, but to subvert our people? This is rather the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which they catch at, to compass the fall of those who stand, not the raising of those who are down. Accordingly, since the very work which they purpose to themselves comes not from the building up of their own society, but from the demolition of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they undermine our edifices, that they may erect their own. Only deprive them of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the divinity of the Creator, and they have not another objection to talk about. The consequence is, that they more easily accomplish the ruin of standing houses than the erection of fallen ruins. It is only when they have such objects in view that they show themselves <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and bland and respectful. Otherwise they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no respect even for their own leaders. Hence it is [supposed] that schisms seldom happen among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, because, even when they exist, they are not obvious.  Their very unity, however,  is <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. I am greatly in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> if they do not among themselves swerve even from their own regulations, forasmuch as every man, just as it suits his own temper, modifies the traditions he has received after the same fashion as the man who handed them down did, when he moulded them according to his own will. The progress of the matter is an acknowledgment at once of its character and of the manner of its birth. That was allowable to the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a> which had been allowed to <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>; that was also fair for the Marcionites which had been done by <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>&mdash; even to innovate on the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as was agreeable to their own pleasure. In short, all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, when thoroughly looked into, are detected harbouring dissent in many particulars even from their own founders. The majority of them have not even churches.  Motherless, houseless, creedless, outcasts, they wander about in their own essential worthlessness. </p>

<h2>Chapter 43. Loose Company Preferred by Heretics. Ungodliness the Effect of Their Teaching the Very Opposite of Catholic Truth, Which Promotes the Fear of God, Both in Religious Ordinances and Practical Life.</h2>

<p>It has also been a subject of remark, how extremely frequent is the intercourse which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> hold with magicians, with mountebanks, with astrologers, with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; and the reason is,  that they are men who devote themselves to curious questions. <q>Seek, and you shall find,</q> is everywhere in their minds. Thus, from the very nature of their conduct, may be estimated the quality of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In their discipline we have an index of their doctrine. They say that God is not to be feared; therefore all things are in their view free and unchecked. Where, however is God not feared, except where He <em>is</em> not? Where God is not, there <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> also is not. Where there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, then, naturally enough, there is also such a discipline as theirs. But where God is, there exists <q>the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the beginning of wisdom.</q>  Where the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God is, there is seriousness, an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and yet thoughtful  diligence, as well as an anxious carefulness and a well-considered admission (to the sacred ministry)  and a safely-guarded  communion, and promotion after good service, and a scrupulous submission (to authority), and a devout attendance,  and a modest gait, and a united church, and God <em>in</em> all things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 44. Heresy Lowers Respect for Christ, and Destroys All Fear of His Great Judgment. The Tendency of Heretical Teaching on This Solemn Article of the Faith. The Present Treatise an Introduction to Certain Other Anti-Heretical Works of Our Author.</h2>

<p>These evidences, then, of a stricter discipline existing among us, are an additional <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, from which no man can safely turn aside, who bears in mind that future judgment, when <q>we must all stand before the judgment-seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note032299"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:10</a></span> to render an account of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself before all things. What, then, will they say who shall have defiled it, even the virgin which Christ committed to them with the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>? I suppose they will allege that no injunction was ever addressed to them by Him or by His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> concerning depraved  and perverse doctrines assailing them,  or about their avoiding and abhorring the same. (He and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, perhaps,) will acknowledge  that the blame rather lies with themselves and their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, in not having given us previous warning and instruction! They  will, besides, add a good deal respecting the high authority of each doctor of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>&mdash;how that these mightily strengthened belief in their own doctrine; how that they raised the dead, restored the sick, foretold the future, that so they might deservedly be regarded as <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. As if this caution were not also in the written record: that many should come who were to work even the greatest <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, in defence of the deceit of their corrupt preaching. So, forsooth, they will deserve to be forgiven! If, however, any, being mindful of the writings and the denunciations of the Lord and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, shall have stood firm in the integrity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, I suppose <em>they</em> will run great risk of missing pardon, when the Lord answers: I plainly forewarned you that there should be teachers of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a> in my name, as well as that of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> also; and to my own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> did I give a charge, that they should preach the same things to you. But as for you, it was not, of course, to be supposed  that you would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me! I once gave the gospel and the doctrine of the said rule (of life and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>) to my <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; but afterwards it was my pleasure to make considerable changes in it! I had promised a resurrection, even of the flesh; but, on second thoughts, it struck me  that I might not be able to keep my promise! I had shown myself to have been born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; but this seemed to me afterwards to be a discreditable thing.  I had said that He was my Father, who is the Maker of the sun and the showers; but another and better father has adopted me! I had forbidden you to lend an ear to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; but in this I erred! Such (<a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>), it is possible,  do enter the minds of those who go out of the right path,  and who do not defend  the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from the danger which besets it. On the present occasion, indeed, our treatise has rather taken up a general position against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, (showing that they must) all be refuted on definite, equitable, and necessary rules, without  any comparison with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. For the rest, if God in His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> permit, we shall prepare answers to certain of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> in separate treatises.  To those who may devote their leisure in reading through these (pages), in the belief of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, be peace, and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of our God <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> for ever. </p>
