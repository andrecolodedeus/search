<h1>Recognitions (Book II)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. Power of Habit.</h2>

<p>When the day dawned which had been fixed for the discussion with Simon, Peter, rising at the first cock-crowing, aroused us also: for we were sleeping in the same apartment, thirteen of us in all;  of whom, next to Peter, Zacch&aelig;us was first, then Sophonius, Joseph and Mich&aelig;as, Eliesdrus, Phineas, Lazarus, and Elis&aelig;us: after these I (Clement) and <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>; then Niceta and Aquila, who had formerly been <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Simon, and were <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Christ under the teaching of Zacch&aelig;us. Of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> there was no one present. As the evening light  was still lasting, we all sat down; and Peter, seeing that we were awake, and that we were giving attention to him, having saluted us, immediately began to speak, as follows:&mdash; </p>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>I confess, brethren, that I wonder at the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which I see to be fit and suited to every call upon it. This, however, it occurs to me to say of what I have found by experience, that when the middle of the night is passed, I awake of my own accord, and sleep does not come to me again. This happens to me for this reason, that I have formed the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of recalling to memory the words of my Lord, which I heard from Himself; and for the longing I have towards them, I constrain my mind and my thoughts to be roused, that, awaking to them, and recalling and arranging them one by one, I may retain them in my memory. From this, therefore, while I desire to cherish the sayings of the Lord with all delight in my heart, the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of waking has come upon me, even if there be nothing that I wish to think of. Thus, in some unaccountable way, when any custom is established, the old custom is changed, provided indeed you do not force it above measure, but as far as the measure of nature admits. For it is not possible to be altogether without sleep; otherwise night would not have been made for rest.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Curtailment of Sleep.</h2>

<p>Then I, when I heard this, said: <span class="quote2"><q>You have very well said, O Peter; for one custom is superseded by another. For when I was at sea, I was at first distressed, and all my system was disordered, so that I felt as if I had been beaten, and could not bear the tossing and tumult of the sea; but after a few days, when I had got accustomed to it, I began to bear it tolerably, so that I was glad to take food immediately in the morning along with the sailors, whereas before it was not my custom to eat anything before the seventh hour. Now, therefore, simply from the custom which I then acquired, hunger reminds me about that time at which I used to eat with the sailors; which, however, I hope to get rid of, when once another custom shall have been formed. I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, therefore, that you also have acquired the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of wakefulness, as you state; and you have wished at a fitting time to explain this to us, that we also may not grudge to throw off and dispense with some portion of our sleep, that we may be able to take in the precepts of the living doctrine. For when the food is digested, and the mind is under the influence of the silence of night, those things which are seasonably taught abide in it.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Need of Caution.</h2>

<p>Then Peter, being pleased to hear that I understood the purport of his preface, that he had delivered it for our advantage; and commending me, doubtless for the purpose of encouraging, and stimulating me, began to deliver the following discourse:  <!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->It seems to me to be seasonable and necessary to have some discussion relating to those things that are near at hand; that is, concerning Simon. For I should wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of what character and of what conduct he is. Wherefore, if any one of you has any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of him, let him not fail to inform me; for it is of consequence to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these things beforehand. For if we have it in charge, that when we enter into a city we should first learn who in it is worthy, <span class="stiki" id="note080603"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;10:11</a></span> that we may eat with him, how much more is it proper for us to ascertain who or what sort of man he is to whom the words of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> are to be committed! For we ought to be careful, yea, extremely careful, that we cast not our pearls before swine. <span class="stiki" id="note080604"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Prudence in Dealing with Opponents.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>But for other reasons also it is of importance that I should have some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this man. For if I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in those things concerning which it cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that they are good, he is faultless and irreproachable,&mdash; that is to say, if he is sober, merciful, upright, gentle, and humane, which no one doubts to be good qualities,&mdash; then it will seem to be fitting, that upon him who possesses these good <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, that which is lacking of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> should be conferred; and so his life, which is in other respects worthy of approbation, should be amended in those points in which it shall appear to be imperfect. But if he remains wrapped up and polluted in those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are manifestly such, it does not become me to speak to him at all of the more secret and sacred things of divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but rather to protest and confront him, that he cease from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and cleanse his actions from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. But if he insinuate himself, and lead us on to speak what he, while he acts improperly, ought not to hear, it will be our part to parry him cautiously. For not to answer him at all does not seem proper, for the sake of the hearers, lest haply they may think that we decline the contest through want of ability to answer him, and so their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be injured through their misunderstanding of our purpose.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Simon Magus, a Formidable Antagonist.</h2>

<p>When Peter had thus spoken to us, Niceta asks permission to say something to him;  and Peter having granted permission, he says: <span class="quote2"><q>With your pardon, I beseech you, my lord Peter, to hear me, who am very anxious for you, and who am afraid lest, in the contest which you have in hand with Simon, you should seem to be overmatched. For it very frequently happens that he who defends the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not gain the victory, since the hearers are either prejudiced, or have no great interest in the better <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But over and above all this, Simon himself is a most vehement orator, trained in the dialectic art, and in the meshes of syllogisms; and what is worse than all, he is greatly skilled in the magic art. And therefore I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, lest haply, being so strongly fortified on every side, he shall be thought to be defending the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, while he is alleging falsehoods, in the presence of those who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him. For neither should we ourselves have been able to escape from him, and to be converted to the Lord, had it not been that, while we were his assistants, and the sharers of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, we had ascertained that he was a deceiver and a magician.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Simon Magus: His Wickedness.</h2>

<p>When Niceta had thus spoken, Aquila also, asking that he might be permitted to speak, proceeded in manner following: <span class="quote2"><q>Receive, I entreat you, most excellent Peter, the assurance of my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards you; for indeed I also am extremely anxious on your account. And do not blame us in this, for indeed to be concerned for any one comes of affection; whereas to be indifferent is no less than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. But I call God to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that I feel for you, not as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> you to be weaker in debate,&mdash; for indeed I was never present at any dispute in which you were engaged,&mdash; but because I well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the impieties of this man, I think of your <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, and at the same time the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the hearers, and above all, the interests of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself. For this magician is vehement towards all things that he wishes, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> above measure. For in all things we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him well, since from boyhood we have been assistants and ministers of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; and had not the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God rescued us from him, we should even now be engaged in the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> with him. But a certain inborn <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards God rendered his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> hateful to us, and the worship of God attractive to us. Whence I think also that it was the work of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, that we, being first made his associates, should take <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in what manner or by what art he effects the prodigies which he seems to work. For who is there that would not be astonished at the wonderful things which he does? Who would not think that he was a god come down from heaven for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men? For myself, I confess, if I had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> him intimately, and had taken part in his doings, I would easily have been carried away with him. Whence it was no great thing for us to be separated from his society, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> as we did that he depends upon magic arts and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> devices. But if you also yourself wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all about him&mdash; who, what, and whence he is, and how he contrives what he does&mdash; then listen.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Simon Magus: His History.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>This Simon's father was Antonius, and his mother Rachel. By nation he is a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, from a village of the Gettones; by profession a <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a>cian yet exceedingly well trained in the Greek literature; desirous of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and boasting above all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, so that he wishes himself to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be an exalted power, which is above God the Creator, and to be thought to be the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and to be called the <em>Standing One</em>. And he uses this name as implying that he can never be dissolved, asserting that his flesh is so compacted by the power of his divinity, that it can endure to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Hence, therefore, he is called the <em>Standing One</em>, as though he cannot fall by any corruption.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Simon Magus: His History.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>For after that John the Baptist was killed, as you yourself also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, when <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a> had broached his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>,  with thirty other chief <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who was called <em>Luna</em> &mdash; whence also these thirty appear to have been appointed with reference to the number of the days, according to the course of the moon&mdash; this Simon ambitious of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as we have said, goes to <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a>, and pretending friendship, entreats him, that if any one of those thirty should die, he should straightway substitute him in room of the dead: for it was contrary to their rule either to exceed the fixed number, or to admit any one who was unknown, or not yet <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>; whence also the rest, desiring to become worthy of the place and number, are eager in every way to please, according to the institutions of their <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> each one of those who aspire after admittance into the number, hoping that he may be deemed worthy to be put into the place of the deceased, when, as we have said, any one dies. Therefore <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a>, being greatly urged by this man, introduced Simon when a vacancy occurred among the number.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Simon Magus: His Profession.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>But not long after he fell in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom they call Luna; and he confided all things to us as his friends: how he was a magician, and how he loved Luna, and how, being desirous of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, he was unwilling to enjoy her ingloriously, but that he was waiting patiently till he could enjoy her honourably; yet so if we also would conspire with him towards the accomplishment of his desires. And he promised that, as a reward of this service, he would <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> us to be invested with the highest honours, and we should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by men to be gods; 'Only, however, on condition,' says he, 'that you confer the chief place upon me, Simon, who by magic art am able to show many signs and prodigies, by means of which either my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> or our <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> may be established. For I am able to render myself invisible to those who wish to lay hold of me, and again to be visible when I am willing to be seen.  If I wish to flee, I can dig through the mountains, and pass through rocks as if they were clay. If I should throw myself headlong from a lofty mountain, I should be borne unhurt to the earth, as if I were held up; when bound, I can loose myself, and bind those who had bound me; being shut up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, I can make the barriers open of their own accord; I can render <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> animated, so that those who see suppose that they are men. I can make new trees suddenly spring up, and produce sprouts at once. I can throw myself into the fire, and not be burnt; I can change my countenance, so that I cannot be recognised; but I can show people that I have two faces. I shall change myself into a sheep or a goat; I shall make a beard to grow upon little boys; I shall ascend by flight into the air; I shall exhibit abundance of gold, and shall make and unmake kings. I shall be worshipped as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; I shall have divine honours publicly assigned to me, so that an image of me shall be set up, and I shall be worshipped and adored as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And what need of more words? Whatever I wish, that I shall be able to do. For already I have achieved many things by way of experiment. In short,' says he, 'once when my mother Rachel ordered me to go to the field to reap, and I saw a sickle lying, I ordered it to go and reap; and it reaped ten times more than the others. Lately, I produced many new sprouts from the earth, and made them bear leaves and produce fruit in a moment; and the nearest mountain I successfully bored through.'</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Simon Magus: His Deception.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>But when he spoke thus of the production of sprouts and the perforation of the mountain, I was confounded on this account, because he wished to deceive even us, in whom he seemed to place confidence; for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that those things had been from the days of our fathers, which he represented as having been done by himself lately. We then, although we heard these atrocities from him, and worse than these, yet we followed up his crimes, and suffered others to be deceived by him, telling also many lies on his behalf; and this before he did any of the things which he had promised, so that while as yet he had done nothing, he was by some thought to be God.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Simon Magus, at the Head of the Sect of Dositheus.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>Meantime, at the outset, as soon as he was reckoned among the thirty <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a>, he began to depreciate <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a> himself, saying that he did not teach purely or perfectly, and that this was the result not of ill intention, but of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a>, when he perceived that Simon was depreciating him, fearing lest his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> might be obscured (for he himself was supposed to be the <em>Standing One</em>), moved with rage, when they met as usual at the school, seized a rod, and began to beat Simon; but suddenly the rod seemed to pass through his body, as if it had been smoke. On which <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a>, being astonished, says to him, 'Tell me if you are the <em>Standing One</em>, that I may adore you.' And when Simon answered that he was, then <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a>, perceiving that he himself was not the Standing One, fell down and worshipped him, and gave up his own place as chief to Simon, ordering all the rank of thirty men to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> him; himself taking the inferior place which Simon formerly occupied. Not long after this he died.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Simon Magus and Luna.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>Therefore, after the death of <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a> Simon took Luna to himself; and with her he still goes about, as you see, deceiving multitudes, and asserting that he himself is a certain power which is above God the Creator, while Luna, who is with him, has been brought down from the higher heavens, and that she is Wisdom, the mother of all things, for whom, says he, the Greeks and barbarians contending, were able in some measure to see an image of her; but of herself, as she is, as the dweller with the first and only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they were wholly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. Propounding these and other things of the same sort, he has deceived many. But I ought also to state this, which I remember that I myself saw. Once, when this Luna of his was in a certain tower, a great multitude had assembled to see her, and were standing around the tower on all sides; but she was seen by all the people to lean forward, and to look out through all the windows of that tower.  Many other wonderful things he did and does; so that men, being astonished at them, think that he himself is the great God.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Simon Magus: Secret of His Magic.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>Now when Niceta and I once asked him to explain to us how these things could be effected by magic art, and what was the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that thing, Simon began thus to explain it to us as his associates. 'I have,' said he, 'made the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a boy, unsullied and violently slain, and invoked by unutterable adjurations, to assist me; and by it all is done that I command.' 'But,' said I, 'is it possible for a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to do these things?' He answered: 'I would have you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man holds the next place after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when once it is set free from the darkness of his body. And immediately it acquires prescience: wherefore it is invoked for necromancy.' Then I answered: 'Why, then, do not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are slain take vengeance on their slayers?' 'Do you not remember,' said he, 'that I told you, that when it goes out of the body it acquires <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the future?' 'I remember,' said I. 'Well, then,' said he, 'as soon as it goes out of the body, it immediately <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that there is a judgment to come, and that every one shall suffer punishment for those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that he has done; and therefore they are unwilling to take vengeance on their slayers, because they themselves are enduring torments for their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> which they had done here, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that severer punishments await them in the judgment. Moreover, they are not permitted by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who preside over them to go out, or to do anything.' 'Then,' I replied, 'if the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not permit them to come hither, or to do what they please, how can the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the magician who invokes them?' 'It is not,' said he, 'that they grant indulgence to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are willing to come: but when the presiding <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are adjured by one greater than themselves, they have the excuse of our <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> who <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> them, to permit the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which we invoke to go out: for they do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> who suffer <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, but we who impose necessity upon them.' Thereupon Niceta, not able longer to refrain, hastily answered, as indeed I also was about to do, only I wished first to get information from him on several points; but, as I said, Niceta, anticipating me, said: 'And do you not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the day of judgment, who do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and invoke <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and deceive men, and bargain for divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to yourself from men? And how do you persuade us that there shall be no judgment, as some of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> confess, and that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are not <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, as many suppose, though you see them with your very eyes, and receive from them assurance of the divine judgment.'</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Simon Magus, Professes to Be God.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>At those sayings of his Simon grew pale; but after a little, recollecting himself, he thus answered: 'Do not think that I am a man of your race. I am neither magician, nor lover of Luna, nor son of Antonius. For before my mother Rachel and he came together, she, still a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, conceived me, while it was in my power to be either small or great, and to appear as a man among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.  Therefore I have chosen you first as my friends, for the purpose of trying you, that I may place you first in my heavenly and unspeakable places when I shall have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> you. Therefore I have pretended to be a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that I might more clearly ascertain if you cherish entire affection towards me.' But when I heard that, judging him indeed to be a wretch, yet wondering at his impudence; and blushing for him, and at the same time fearing lest he should attempt some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against us, I beckoned to Niceta to feign for a little along with me, and said to him: 'Be not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with us, corruptible men, O you incorruptible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but rather accept our affection, and our mind willing to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who God is; for we did not till now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who you are, nor did we perceive that you are he whom we were seeking.'</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Simon Magus, Professed to Have Made a Boy of Air.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>As we spoke these and such like words with looks suited to the occasion, this most vain fellow <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that we were deceived; and being thereby the more elated, he added also this: 'I shall now be propitious to you, for the affection which you bear towards me as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for you loved me while you did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me, and were seeking me in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. But I would not have you <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when one is able to become small or great as he pleases; for I am able to appear to man in whatever manner I please. Now, then, I shall begin to unfold to you what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Once on a time, I, by my power, turning air into water, and water again into blood, and solidifying it into flesh, formed a new <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> creature&mdash; a boy&mdash; and produced a much nobler work than God the Creator. For He created a man from the earth, but I from air&mdash; a far more difficult matter; and again I unmade him and restored him to air, but not until I had placed his picture and image in my bed-chamber, as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> and memorial of my work.' Then we understood that he spoke concerning that boy, whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, after he had been slain by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, he made use of for those services which he required.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 16. Simon Magus: Hopelessness of His Case.</h2>

<p>But Peter, hearing these things, said with tears:  <span class="quote2"><q>Greatly do I wonder at the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> patience of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, on the other hand, at the audacity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> rashness in some. For what further reason can be found to persuade Simon that God judges the unrighteous, since he persuades himself that he employs the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> for the service of his crimes? But, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he is deluded by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Yet, although he is sure by these very things that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and are judged for the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which they have done, and although he thinks that he really sees those things which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; though, as I said, he is deluded by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, yet he thinks that he sees the very substance of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. How shall such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, I say, be brought to confess either that he acts wickedly while he occupies such an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> position, or that he is to be judged for those things which he has done, who, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, despises it, and shows himself an enemy to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and dares commit such horrid things? Wherefore it is certain, my brethren, that some oppose the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and religion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not because it appears to them that reason can by no means stand with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but because they are either involved in excess of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, or prevented by their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, or elated by the swelling of their heart, so that they do not even <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> those things which they think that they see with their own eyes.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 17. Men Enemies to God.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>But, inasmuch as inborn affection towards God the Creator seemed to suffice for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to those who loved Him, the enemy studies to pervert this affection in men, and to render them hostile and ungrateful to their Creator. For I call heaven and earth to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that if God permitted the enemy to rage as much as he desires, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should have perished long ere now; but for His mercy's sake God does not suffer him. But if men would turn their affection towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all would doubtless be saved, even if for some faults they might seem to be corrected for righteousness. But now the most of men have been made enemies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose hearts the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one has entered, and has turned aside towards himself the affection which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Creator had implanted in them, that they might have it towards Him. But of the rest, who seemed for a time to be watchful, the enemy, appearing in a phantasy of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and splendour, and promising them certain great and mighty things, has caused their mind and heart to wander away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; yet it is for some just reason that he is permitted to accomplish these things.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 18. Responsibility of Men.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->To this Aquila answered: <span class="quote2"><q>How, then, are men in fault, if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one, transforming himself into the brightness of light, <span class="stiki" id="note080612"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:14</a></span> promises to men greater things than the Creator Himself does?</q></span> Then Peter answered: <span class="quote2"><q>I think,</q></span> says he <span class="quote2"><q>that nothing is more <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> than this; and now listen while I tell you how <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> it is. If your son, whom you have trained and nourished with all care, and brought to man's estate, should be ungrateful to you, and should leave you and go to another, whom perhaps he may have seen to be richer, and should show to him the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which he owed to you, and, through hope of greater profit, should deny his birth, and refuse you your paternal rights, would this seem to you right or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>?</q></span> Then Aquila answered: <span class="quote2"><q>It is manifest to all that it would be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</q></span> Then Peter said: <span class="quote2"><q>If you say that this would be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, how much more so is it in the case of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who, above all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, is worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> from men; whose benefits we not only enjoy, but by whose means and power it is that we began to be when we were not, and whom, if we please, we shall obtain from Him to be for ever in blessedness! In order, therefore, that the unfaithful may be distinguished from the faithful, and the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> from the impious, it has been permitted to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one to use those arts by which the affections of every one towards the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Father may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. But if there were in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> some strange <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were it right to leave our own <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who created us, and who is our Father and our Maker, and to pass over to another?</q></span> <span class="quote2"><q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid.</q></span> said Aquila. Then said Peter: <span class="quote2"><q>How, then, shall we say that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when this is done by permission of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that those may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> and condemned in the day of judgment, who, allured by greater promises, have abandoned their duty towards their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Father and Creator; while those who have kept the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of their own Father, even with poverty, if so it has befallen, and with tribulation, may enjoy heavenly gifts and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> dignities in His kingdom. But we shall expound these things more carefully at another time. Meantime I desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what Simon did after this.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 19. Disputation Begun.</h2>

<p>And Niceta answered: <span class="quote2"><q>When he perceived that we had found him out, having spoken to one another concerning his crimes, we left him, and came to Zacch&aelig;us, telling him those same things which we have now told to you. But he, receiving us most kindly, and instructing us concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, enrolled us in the number of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.</q></span> When Niceta had done speaking, Zacch&aelig;us, who had gone out a little before, entered, saying, <span class="quote2"><q>It is time, O Peter, that you proceed to the disputation; for a great crowd, collected in the court of the house, is awaiting you, in the midst of whom stands Simon, supported by many attendants.</q></span> Then Peter, when he heard this, ordering me to withdraw for the sake of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (for I had not yet been washed from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which I had committed in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>), said to the rest, <span class="quote2"><q>Brethren, let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for His unspeakable mercy through His Christ, would help me going out on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men who have been created by Him.</q></span> Having said this, and having <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, he went forth to the court of the house, in which a great multitude of people were assembled; and when he saw them all looking intently on him in profound silence, and <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon the Magician</a> standing in the midst of them like a standard-bearer, he began in manner following. </p>

<h2>Chapter 20. The Kingdom of God and His Righteousness.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Peace be to all of you who are prepared to give your right hands to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>:  for whosoever are <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to it seem indeed themselves to confer some favour upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whereas they do themselves obtain from Him the gift of His greatest bounty, walking in His paths of righteousness. Wherefore the first duty of all is to inquire into the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His kingdom; <span class="stiki" id="note080615"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;6:33</a></span> His righteousness, that we may be taught to act rightly; His kingdom, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is the reward appointed for labour and patience; in which kingdom there is indeed a bestowal of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things upon the good, but upon those who have acted contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a worthy infliction of penalties in proportion to the doings of every one. It becomes you, therefore, while you are here,&mdash; that is, while you are in the present life,&mdash; to ascertain the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while there is opportunity also of doing it. For if any one, before he amends his doings, wishes to investigate concerning things which he cannot discover, such investigation will be foolish and ineffectual. For the time is short, and the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> shall be occupied with <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, not questions. Therefore before all things let us inquire into this, what or in what manner we must act that we may merit to obtain <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21. Righteousness the Way to the Kingdom.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>For if we occupy the short time of this life with vain and useless questions, we shall without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> go into the presence of God empty and void of good works, when, as I have said, our works shall be brought into judgment. For everything has its own time and place. This is the place, this the time of works; the world to come, that of recompenses. That we may not therefore be entangled, by changing the order of places and times, let us inquire, in the first place, what is the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so that, like <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> going to set out on a journey, we may be filled with good works as with abundant provision, so that we may be able to come to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, as to a very great city. For to those who think aright, God is manifest even by the operations of the world which He has made, using the evidence of His creation; <span class="stiki" id="note080616"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;1:20</a></span> and therefore, since there ought to be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we have now to inquire only about His righteousness and His kingdom. But if our mind suggest to us to make any inquiry concerning secret and hidden things before we inquire into the works of righteousness, we ought to render to ourselves a reason, because if acting well we shall merit to obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: then, going to God chaste and clean, we shall be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things that are secret and hidden, without any cavilling of questions; whereas now, even if any one should spend the whole of his life in inquiring into these things, he not only shall not be able to find them, but shall involve himself in greater <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, because he did not first enter through the way of righteousness, and strive to reach the haven of life.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 22. Righteousness; What It is.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>And therefore I advise that His righteousness be first inquired into, that, pursuing our journey through it, and placed in the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we may be able to find the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Prophet, running not with swiftness of foot, but with goodness of works, and that, enjoying His guidance, we may be under no danger of mistaking the way. For if under His guidance we shall merit to enter that city to which we desire to come, all things concerning which we now inquire we shall see with our eyes, being made, as it were, heirs of all things. Understand, therefore, that the way is this course of our life; the travellers are those who do good works; the gate is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Prophet, of whom we speak; the city is the kingdom in which dwells the Almighty Father, whom only those can see who are of pure heart. <span class="stiki" id="note080617"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> Let us not then think the labour of this journey hard, because at the end of it there shall be rest. For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Prophet Himself also from the beginning of the world, through the course of time, hastens to rest. For He is present with us at all times; and if at any time it is necessary, He appears and corrects us, that He may bring to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him. Therefore this is my judgment, as also it is the pleasure of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Prophet, that inquiry should first be made concerning righteousness, by those especially who profess that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God. If therefore any one has anything to propose which he thinks better, let him speak; and when he has spoken, let him hear, but with patience and quietness: for in order to this at the first, by way of salutation, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for peace to you all.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 23. Simon Refuses Peace.</h2>

<p>To this Simon answered:  <span class="quote2"><q>We have no need of your peace; for if there be peace and concord,  we shall not be able to make any advance towards the discovery of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> and debauchees have peace among themselves, and every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> agrees with itself; and if we have met with this view, that for the sake of peace we should give assent to all that is said, we shall confer no benefit upon the hearers; but, on the contrary, we shall impose upon them, and shall depart friends. Wherefore, do not invoke peace, but rather battle, which is the mother of peace; and if you can, exterminate <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. And do not seek for friendship obtained by unfair admissions; for this I would have you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, above all, that when two fight with each other, then there will be peace when one has been defeated and has fallen. And therefore fight as best you can, and do not expect peace without <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, which is impossible; or if it can be attained, show us how.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 24. Peter's Explanation.</h2>

<p>To this Peter answered: <!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Hear with all attention, O men, what we say. Let us suppose that this world is a great plain, and that from two states, whose kings are at variance with each other, two generals were sent to fight: and suppose the general of the good king gave this counsel, that both armies should without bloodshed submit to the authority of the better king, whereby all should be safe without danger; but that the opposite general should say, No, but we must fight; that not he who is worthy, but who is stronger, may reign, with those who shall escape;&mdash; which, I ask you, would you rather choose? I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not but that you would give your hands to the better king, with the safety of all. And I do not now wish, as Simon says that I do, that assent should be given, for the sake of peace, to those things that are spoken amiss but that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be sought for with quietness and order.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25. Principles on Which the Discussion Should Be Conducted.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>For some, in the contest of disputations, when they perceive that their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is confuted, immediately begin, for the sake of making good their retreat, to create a disturbance, and to stir up strifes, that it may not be manifest to all that they are defeated; and therefore I frequently entreat that the investigation of the matter in dispute may be conducted with all patience and quietness, so that if perchance anything seem to be not rightly spoken, it may be allowed to go back over it, and explain it more distinctly. For sometimes a thing may be spoken in one way and heard in another, while it is either advanced too obscurely, or not attended to with sufficient care; and on this account I desire that our conversation should be conducted patiently, so that neither should the one snatch it away from the other, nor should the unseasonable speech of one contradicting interrupt the speech of the other; and that we should not cherish the desire of finding fault, but that we should be allowed, as I have said, to go over again what has not been clearly enough spoken, that by fairest examination the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may become clearer. For we ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that if any one is conquered by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it is not he that is conquered, but the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which is in him, which is the worst of all <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; so that he who can drive it out receives the palm of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For it is our purpose to benefit the hearers, not that we may conquer badly, but that we may be well conquered for the acknowledgment of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For if our speech be actuated by the desire of seeking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, even although we shall speak anything imperfectly through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty, God in His unspeakable goodness will fill up secretly in the understandings of the hearers those things that are lacking. For He is righteous; and according to the purpose of every one, He enables some to find easily what they seek, while to others He renders even that obscure which is before their eyes. Since, then, the way of God is the way of peace, let us with peace seek the things which are God's. If any one has anything to advance in answer to this, let him do so; but if there is no one who wishes to answer, I shall begin to speak, and I myself shall bring forward what another may object to me, and shall refute it.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 26. Simon's Interruption.</h2>

<p>When therefore Peter had begun to continue his discourse, Simon, interrupting his speech, said: <span class="quote2"><q>Why do you hasten to speak whatever you please? I understand your tricks. You wish to bring forward those matters whose explanation you have well studied, that you may appear to the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> crowd to be speaking well; but I shall not allow you this subterfuge. Now therefore, since you promise, as a brave man, to answer to all that any one chooses to bring forward, be pleased to answer me in the first place.</q></span> Then Peter said: <span class="quote2"><q>I am ready, only provided that our discussion may be with peace.</q></span> Then Simon said: <span class="quote2"><q>Do not you see, O simpleton, that in pleading for peace you act in opposition to your Master, and that what you propose is not suitable to him who promises that he will overthrow <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>? Or, if you are right in asking peace from the audience, then your Master was wrong in saying, 'I have not come to send peace on earth, but a sword.' <span class="stiki" id="note080619"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;10:34</a></span> For either you say well, and he not well; or else, if your Master said well, then you not at all well: for you do not understand that your statement is contrary to his, whose <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> you profess yourself to be.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 27. Questions and Answers.</h2>

<p>Then Peter: <span class="quote2"><q>Neither He who sent me did amiss in sending a sword upon the earth, nor do I act contrary to Him in asking peace of the hearers. But you both unskilfully and rashly find fault with what you do not understand: for you have heard that the Master came not to send peace on earth; but that He also said, 'Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the very sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,' <span class="stiki" id="note080620"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;5:9</a></span> you have not heard. Wherefore my sentiments are not different from those of the Master when I recommend peace, to the keepers of which He assigned blessedness.</q></span> Then Simon said: <span class="quote2"><q>In your desire to answer for your Master, O Peter, you have brought a much more serious charge against him, if he himself came not to make peace, yet enjoined upon others to keep it. Where, then, is the consistency of that other saying of his, 'it is enough for the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> that he be as his master?'</q></span> <span class="stiki" id="note080621"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;10:25</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 28. Consistency of Christ's Teaching.</h2>

<p>To this Peter answered: <span class="quote2"><q>Our Master, who was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Prophet, and ever mindful of Himself, neither contradicted Himself, nor enjoined upon us anything different from what Himself practised. For whereas He said, 'I am not come to send peace on earth, but a sword; and henceforth you shall see father separated from son, son from father, husband from wife and wife from husband, mother from daughter and daughter from mother, brother from brother, father-in-law from daughter-in-law, friend from friend,' all these contain the doctrine of peace; and I will tell you how. At the beginning of His preaching, as wishing to invite and lead all to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and induce them to bear patiently labours and trials, He blessed the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and promised that they should obtain the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> for their endurance of poverty, in order that under the influence of such a hope they might bear with equanimity the weight of poverty, despising <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>; for <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is one, and the greatest, of most pernicious <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But He promised also that the hungry and the thirsty should be satisfied with the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessings of righteousness, in order that they might bear poverty patiently, and not be led by it to undertake any unrighteous work. In like manner, also, He said that the pure in heart are blessed, and that thereby they should see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that every one desiring so great a good might keep himself from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and polluted thoughts.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 29. Peace and Strife.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>Thus, therefore, our Master, inviting His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to patience, impressed upon them that the blessing of peace was also to be preserved with the labour of patience. But, on the other hand, He mourned over those who lived in riches and luxury, who bestowed nothing upon the poor; proving that they must render an account, because they did not pity their neighbours, even when they were in poverty, whom they ought to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> as themselves. And by such sayings as these He brought some indeed to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him, but others He rendered hostile. The <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> therefore, and the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>, He charges to have peace among themselves. and says to them, 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the very sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note080622"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;5:9</a></span> But to those who not only did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but set themselves in opposition to His doctrine, He proclaims the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the word and of confutation, and says that 'henceforth you shall see son separated from father, and husband from wife, and daughter from mother, and brother from brother, and daughter-in-law from mother-in-law, and a man's foes shall be they of his own house.'  For in every house, when there begins to be a difference between believer and unbeliever, there is necessarily a contest: the unbelievers, on the one hand, fighting against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> on the other, confuting the old <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in them.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 30. Peace to the Sons of Peace.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>In like manner, also, during the last period of His teaching, He wages <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, charging them with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> and unsound doctrine, and with hiding the key of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which they had handed down to them from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, by which the gate of the heavenly kingdom might be opened.  But when our Master sent us forth to preach, He commanded us, that into whatsoever city or house we should enter, we should say, 'Peace be to this house.' 'And if,' said He, 'a son of peace be there, your peace shall come upon him; but if there be not, your peace shall return to you.' Also that, going out from that house or city, we should shake off upon them the very dust which adhered to our feet. 'But it shall be more tolerable for the land of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> in the day of judgment than for that city or house.'  This indeed He commanded to be done at length, if first the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be preached in the city or house, whereby they who receive the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may become sons of peace and sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and those who will not receive it may be convicted as enemies of peace and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 31. Peace and War.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>Thus, therefore, we, observing the commands of our Master, first offer peace to our hearers, that the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> without any tumult. But if any one do not receive the words of peace, nor acquiesce in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to direct against him the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the word, and to rebuke him sharply by confuting his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and charging home upon him his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore of necessity we offer peace, that if any one is a son of peace, our peace may come upon him; but from him who makes himself an enemy of peace, our peace shall return to ourselves. We do not therefore, as you say, propose peace by agreement with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, for indeed we should straightway have given you the right hand; but only in order that, through our discussing quietly and patiently, it might be more easily ascertained by the hearers which is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> speech. But if you differ and disagree with yourself, how shall you stand? He must of necessity fall who is divided in himself; 'for every kingdom divided against itself shall not stand.' <span class="stiki" id="note080626"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;12:25</a></span> If you have anything to say to this, say on.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 32. Simon's Challenge.</h2>

<p>Then said Simon: <span class="quote2"><q>I am astonished at your folly. For you so propound the words of your Master, as if it were held to be certain concerning him that he is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; while I can very easily prove that he often contradicted himself. In short, I shall refute you from those words which you have yourself brought forward. For you say, that he said that every kingdom or every city divided in itself shall not stand; and elsewhere you say, that he said that he would send a sword, that he might separate those who are in one house, so that son shall be divided from father, daughter from mother, brother from brother; so that if there be five in one house, three shall be divided against two, and two against three. <span class="stiki" id="note080627"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse51">Luke&nbsp;12:51-53</a></span> If, then, everything that is divided falls, he who makes divisions furnishes causes of falling; and if he is such, assuredly he is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Answer this if you can.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 33. Authority.</h2>

<p>Then Peter: <span class="quote2"><q>Do not rashly take exception, O Simon, against the things which you do not understand. In the first place, I shall answer your assertion, that I set forth the words of my Master, and from them resolve matters about which there is still <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Our Lord, when He sent us <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to preach, enjoined us to teach all nations <span class="stiki" id="note080628"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19-20</a></span> the things which were committed to us. We cannot therefore speak those things as they were spoken by Himself. For our commission is not to <em>speak</em>, but to <em>teach</em> those things, and from them to show how every one of them rests upon <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Nor, again, are we permitted to speak anything of our own. For we are sent; and of necessity he who is sent delivers the message as he has been ordered, and sets forth the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the sender. For if I should speak anything different from what He who sent me enjoined me, I should be a false apostle, not saying what I am commanded to say, but what seems good to myself. Whoever does this, evidently wishes to show himself to be better than he is by whom he is sent, and without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is a traitor. If, on the contrary, he keeps by the things that he is commanded, and brings forward most clear assertions of them, it will appear that he is accomplishing the work of an apostle; and it is by striving to fulfil this that I displease you. Blame me not, therefore, because I bring forward the words of Him who sent me. But if there is anything in them that is not fairly spoken, you have liberty to confute me; but this can in no way be done, for He is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and cannot be contrary to Himself. But if you do not think that He is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, let this be first inquired into.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 34. Order of Proof.</h2>

<p>Then said Simon: <span class="quote2"><q>I have no need to learn this from you, but how these things agree with one another. For if he shall be shown to be inconsistent, he shall be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> at the same time not to be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</q></span> Then says Peter: <span class="quote2"><q>But if I first show Him to be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, it will follow that what seems to be inconsistency is not such. For no one can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> merely by consistency, because it is possible for many to attain this; but if consistency does not make a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, much more inconsistency does not. Because, therefore, there are many things which to some seem inconsistent, which yet have consistency in them on a more profound investigation; as also other things which seem to have consistency, but which, being more carefully discussed, are found to be inconsistent; for this reason I do not think there is any better way to judge of these things than to ascertain in the first instance whether He be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> who has spoken those things which appear to be inconsistent. For it is evident that, if He be found a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, those things which seem to be contradictory must have consistency, but are misunderstood. Concerning these things, therefore, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> will be properly demanded. For we <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> are sent to expound the sayings and affirm the judgments of Him who has sent us; but we are not commissioned to say anything of our own, but to unfold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as I have said, of His words.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 35. How Error Cannot Stand with Truth.</h2>

<p>Then Simon said: <span class="quote2"><q>Instruct us, therefore, how it can be consistent that he who causes divisions, which divisions <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> those who are divided to fall, can either seem to be good, or to have come for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men.</q></span> Then Peter said: <span class="quote2"><q>I will tell you how our Master said that every kingdom and every house divided against itself cannot stand; and whereas He Himself did this, see how it makes for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. By the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> He certainly divides the kingdom of the world, which is founded in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and every home in it, that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> may fall, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may reign. But if it happen to any house, that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, being introduced by any one, divides the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, then, where <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> has gained a footing, it is certain that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> cannot stand.</q></span> Then Simon said: <span class="quote2"><q>But it is uncertain whether your master divides <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q></span> Then Peter: <span class="quote2"><q>That belongs to another question; but if you are agreed that everything which is divided falls, it remains that I show, if only you will hear in peace, that our Jesus has divided and dispelled <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by teaching <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 36. Altercation.</h2>

<p>Then said Simon: <span class="quote2"><q>Do not repeat again and again your talk of peace, but expound briefly what it is that you think or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q></span> Peter answered: <span class="quote2"><q>Why are you afraid of hearing frequently of peace? For do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that peace is the perfection of law? For <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and disputes spring from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and where there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there is peace of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but where there is peace, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is found in disputations, righteousness in works.</q></span> Then Simon: <span class="quote2"><q>You seem to me not to be able to profess what you think.</q></span> Then Peter: <span class="quote2"><q>I shall speak, but according to my own judgment, not under constraint of your tricks. For I desire that what is salutary and profitable be brought to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all and therefore I shall not delay to state it as briefly as possible. There is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>; and He is the creator of the world, a righteous judge, rendering to every one at some time or other according to his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.  But now for the assertion of these things I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that countless thousands of words can be called forth.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 37. Simon's Subtlety.</h2>

<p>Then Simon said: <span class="quote2"><q>I admire, indeed, the quickness of your wit, yet I do not embrace the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For you have wisely foreseen that you may be contradicted; and you have even politely confessed, that for the assertion of these things countless thousands of words will be called forth, for no one agrees with the profession of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In short, as to there being one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the world being His work, who can receive this doctrine? Neither, I think, any one of the Pagans, even if he be an unlearned man, and certainly no one of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; but not even the rudest and most wretched of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, nor I myself, who am well acquainted with their law.</q></span> Then Peter said: <span class="quote2"><q>Put aside the opinions of those who are not here, and tell us face to face what is your own.</q></span> Then Simon said: <span class="quote2"><q>I can state what I really think; but this consideration makes me reluctant to do so, that if I say what is neither acceptable to you, nor seems right to this unskilled rabble, you indeed, as confounded, will straightway shut your ears, that they may not be polluted with <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, forsooth, and will take to flight because you cannot find an answer; while the unreasoning populace will assent to you, and embrace you as one teaching those things which are commonly received among them; and will curse me, as professing things new and unheard of, and instilling my <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> into the minds of others.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 38. Simon's Creed.</h2>

<p>Then Peter: <span class="quote2"><q>Are not you making use of long preambles, as you accused us of doing, because you have no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to bring forward? For if you have, begin without circumlocution, if you have so much confidence. And if, indeed, what you say be displeasing to any one of the hearers, he will withdraw; and those who remain shall be compelled by your assertion to approve what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Begin, therefore, to expound what seems to you to be right.</q></span> Then Simon said: <span class="quote2"><q>I say that there are many gods; but that there is one incomprehensible and unknown to all, and that He is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all these gods.</q></span> Then Peter answered: <span class="quote2"><q>This God whom you assert to be incomprehensible and unknown to all, can you prove His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,  which are held to be of authority, or from some others of which we are all <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, or from the Greek authors, or from your own writings? Certainly you are at liberty to speak from whatever writings you please, yet so that you first show that they are prophetic; for so their authority will be held without question.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 39. Argument for Polytheism.</h2>

<p>Then Simon said: <span class="quote2"><q>I shall make use of assertions from the law of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> only. For it is manifest to all who take interest in religion, that this law is of universal authority, yet that every one receives the understanding of this law according to his own judgment. For it has so been written by Him who created the world, that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of things is made to depend upon it. Whence, whether any one wishes to bring forward <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or any one to bring forward <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, no assertion will be received without this law. Inasmuch, therefore, as my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is most fully in accordance with the law, I rightly declared that there are many gods, of whom one is more eminent than the rest, and incomprehensible, even He who is God of gods. But that there are many gods, the law itself informs me. For, in the first place, <em>it says this in the passage</em> where one in the figure of a serpent speaks to Eve, the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, 'On the day you eat of the tree of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, you shall be as gods,' <span class="stiki" id="note080631"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse5">Genesis&nbsp;3:5</a></span> that is, as those who made man; and after they have tasted of the tree, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself testifies, saying to the rest of the gods, 'Behold, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> has become as one of us;' <span class="stiki" id="note080632"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse22">Genesis&nbsp;3:22</a></span> thus, therefore, it is manifest that there were many gods engaged in the making of man. Also, whereas at the first God said to the other gods, 'Let us make man after our image and likeness;' <span class="stiki" id="note080633"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> also His saying, 'Let us drive him out;' <span class="stiki" id="note080634"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse22">Genesis&nbsp;3:22</a></span> and again, 'Come, let us go down, and confound their language;' <span class="stiki" id="note080635"><a href="../bible/gen011.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;11:7</a></span> all these things indicate that there are many gods. But this also is written, 'You shall not curse the gods, nor curse the chief of your people;' <span class="stiki" id="note080636"><a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse28">Exodus&nbsp;22:28</a></span> and again this writing, 'God alone led them, and there was no strange god with them,' <span class="stiki" id="note080637"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:12</a></span> shows that there are many gods. There are also many other testimonies which might be adduced from the law, not only obscure, but plain, by which it is taught that there are many gods.  One of these was chosen by lot, that he might be the god of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. But it is not of him that I speak, but of that God who is also his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom even the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. For he is not their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 40. Peter's Answer.</h2>

<p>When Peter had heard this, he answered: <span class="quote2"><q>Fear nothing, Simon: for, behold, we have neither shut our ears, nor fled; but we answer with words of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to those things which you have spoken <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, asserting this first, that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, even the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who is the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator of heaven and earth, who is also the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all those whom you call gods. If, then, I shall show you that none is superior to Him, but that He Himself is above all, you will confess that your <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is above all.</q></span>  Then Simon said: <span class="quote2"><q>Why, indeed, though I should be unwilling to confess it, would not the hearers who stand by charge me with unwillingness to profess the things that are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>?</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 41. The Answer, Continued.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>Listen, then,</q></span> says Peter, <!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, first of all, that even if there are many gods, as you say, they are subject to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, to whom no one is equal, than whom no one can be greater; for it is written that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> thus spoke to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: 'The Lord your God is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of gods, and the Lord of lords, the great God.' <span class="stiki" id="note080640"><a href="../bible/deu010.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy&nbsp;10:17</a></span> Thus, although there are many that are called gods, yet He who is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> is alone called the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of gods. For not every one that is called God is necessarily God. Indeed, even <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is called a god to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note080641"><a href="../bible/exo007.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;7:1</a></span> and it is certain that he was a man; and judges were called gods, and it is evident that they were mortal. The <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> also of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are called gods, and we all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are not; but this has been inflicted as a punishment on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, that because they would not acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they should regard as God whatever form or image should occur to them. Because they refused to receive the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the One who, as I said, is God of all, therefore it is permitted to them to have as gods those who can do nothing for their worshippers. For what can either dead images or living creatures confer upon men, since the power of all things is with One?</p>

<h2>Chapter 42. Guardian Angels.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Therefore the name <em>God</em> is applied in three ways:  either because he to whom it is given is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or because he is the servant of him who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>; and for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the sender, that his authority may be full, he that is sent is called by the name of him who sends, as is often done in respect of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: for when they appear to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if he is a wise and intelligent man, he asks the name of him who appears to him, that he may acknowledge at once the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the sent, and the authority of the sender. For every nation has an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, to whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has committed the government of that nation; and when one of these appears, although he be thought and called God by those over whom he presides, yet, being asked, he does not give such testimony to himself. For the Most High <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who alone holds the power of all things, has divided all the nations of the earth into seventy-two parts, and over these He has appointed <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as princes. But to the one among the archangels who is greatest, was committed the government of those who, before all others, received the worship and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Most High God. But <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men also, as we have said, are made gods to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, as having received the power of life and death over them, as we mentioned above with respect to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the judges. Wherefore it is also written concerning them, 'You shall not curse the gods, and you shall not curse the prince of your people.' <span class="stiki" id="note080643"><a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse28">Exodus&nbsp;22:28</a></span> Thus the princes of the several nations are called gods. But Christ is God of princes, who is Judge of all. Therefore neither <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, nor men, nor any creature, can be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> gods, forasmuch as they are placed under authority, being created and changeable: <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, for they were not, and are; men, for they are mortal; and every creature, for it is capable of dissolution, if only He dissolve it who made it. And therefore He alone is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who not only Himself lives, but also bestows life upon others, which He can also take away when it pleases Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 43. No God But Jehovah.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Wherefore the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> exclaims in name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, saying, 'Behold, behold, seeing that I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there is none else besides me, I will kill, and I will make alive; I will smite, and I will heal; and there is none who can deliver out of my hands.' <span class="stiki" id="note080644"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse39">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:39</a></span> See therefore how, by some ineffable <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, opposing the future <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of those who should affirm that either in heaven or on earth there is any other god besides Him who is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, decides thus: 'The Lord your God is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, in heaven above, and in the earth beneath; and besides Him there is none else.' <span class="stiki" id="note080645"><a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse39">Deuteronomy&nbsp;4:39</a></span> How, then, have you dared to say that there is any other God besides Him who is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? And again the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, 'Behold, to the Lord your God belong the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the earth, and all things that are in them: nevertheless I have chosen your fathers, that I might <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them, and you after them.' <span class="stiki" id="note080646"><a href="../bible/deu010.htm#verse14">Deuteronomy&nbsp;10:14-15</a></span> Thus that judgment is supported by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> on every side, that He who created the world is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and only God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 44. The Serpent, the Author of Polytheism.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But even if there be others, as we have said, who are called gods, they are under the power of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; for thus says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, 'The Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He is God of gods, and Lord of lords.' <span class="stiki" id="note080647"><a href="../bible/deu010.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy&nbsp;10:17</a></span> Him alone the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> also commands to be worshipped, saying, 'You shall worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him only shall you serve;'  and, 'Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: the Lord your God is one God.' <span class="stiki" id="note080649"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:4</a></span> Yea, also the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and bedewed with the drops of His mercy, cried out, saying, 'Who is like You among the gods? O Lord, who is like You?'  And again, 'Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the Lord; and who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but our Lord.'  Therefore <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when he saw that the people were advancing, by degrees initiated them in the understanding of the monarchy and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as he says in the following words: 'You shall not make mention of the names of other gods;'  doubtless remembering with what penalty the serpent was visited, which had first named <em>gods</em>.  For it is condemned to feed upon dust, and is judged worthy of such food, for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, that it first of all introduced the name of <em>gods</em> into the world. But if you also wish to introduce many gods, see that you partake not the serpent's doom.</p>

<h2>Chapter 45. Polytheism Inexcusable.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->For be sure of this, that you shall not have us participators in this attempt; nor will we suffer ourselves to be deceived by you. For it will not serve us for an excuse in the judgment, if we say that you deceived us; because neither could it excuse the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, that she had unhappily <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the serpent; but she was condemned to death, because she <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> badly. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> therefore, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, also commending the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of one God to the people, says, 'Take heed to yourself, that you be not seduced from the Lord your God.' <span class="stiki" id="note080654"><a href="../bible/deu008.htm#verse11">Deuteronomy&nbsp;8:11</a></span> Observe that he makes use of the same word which the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> also made use of in excusing herself, saying that she was seduced; but it profited her nothing. But over and above all this, even if some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> should arise, who should perform signs and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but should wish to persuade us to worship other gods besides the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, we should never be able to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him. For so the divine law has taught us, handing down a secret injunction more purely by means of tradition, for thus it says: 'If there arise among you a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, or one dreaming a dream, and give you signs or wonders, and these signs or wonders come to pass, and he say to you, Let us go and worship strange gods, whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not; you shall not hear the words of that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, nor the dream of that dreamer, because proving he has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> you, that he may see if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God.' <span class="stiki" id="note080655"><a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy&nbsp;13:1-3</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 46. Christ Acknowledged the God of the Jews.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>Wherefore also our Lord, who wrought signs and wonders, preached the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and therefore we are right in believing what He preached. But as for you, even if you were really a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and performed signs and wonders, as you promise to do, if you were to announce other gods besides Him who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it would be manifest that you were raised up as a trial to the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and therefore you can by no means be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. For He alone is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and for this reason <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> did not teach them that they must inquire after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for Him they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> well already, but that they must seek His kingdom and righteousness, <span class="stiki" id="note080656"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;6:33</a></span> which the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, having received the key of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, had not shut in, but shut out. <span class="stiki" id="note080657"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse52">Luke&nbsp;11:52</a></span> For if they had been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, surely He would never have left the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this thing, which was the chief of all, and blamed them for small and little things, as for enlarging their fringes, and claiming the uppermost rooms in feasts, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> standing in the highways, and such like things; which assuredly, in comparison of this great charge, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seem to be small and insignificant matters.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 47. Simon's Cavil.</h2>

<p>To this Simon replied:  <span class="quote2"><q>From the words of your master I shall refute you, because even he introduces to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> a certain God who was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For although both Adam <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the God who was his creator, and the maker of the world; and <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him, inasmuch as he was translated by him; and <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, since he was ordered by him to construct the ark; and although <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and all, even every people and all nations, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the maker of the world, and confess him to be a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet your Jesus, who appeared long after the patriarchs, says: 'No one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but the Father; neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> any one the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he to whom the Son has been pleased to reveal Him.'  Thus, therefore, even your Jesus confesses that there is another <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, incomprehensible and unknown to all.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 48. Peter's Answer.</h2>

<p>Then Peter says: <span class="quote2"><q>You do not perceive that you are making statements in opposition to yourself. For if our Jesus also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him whom you call the unknown <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then He is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by you alone. Yea, if our Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him, then <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also, who prophesied that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> should come, assuredly could not himself be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Him. For he was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; and he who prophesied of the Son doubtless <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the Father. For if it is in the option of the Son to reveal the Father to whom He will, then the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who has been with the Father from the beginning, and through all generations, as He revealed the Father to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, so also to the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; but if this be so, it is evident that the Father has not been unknown to any of them. But how could the Father be revealed to you, who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, since the Father is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to none except him to whom the Son is pleased to reveal Him? But the Son reveals the Father to those who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Son as they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Father.</q></span> <span class="stiki" id="note080660"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;5:23</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 49. The Supreme Light.</h2>

<p>Then Simon said: <span class="quote2"><q>Remember that you said that God has a son, which is doing Him wrong; for how can He have a son, unless He is subject to <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, like men or animals? But on these points there is not time now to show your profound folly, for I hasten to make a statement concerning the immensity of the supreme light; and so now listen. My opinion is, that there is a certain power of immense and ineffable light, whose greatness may be held to be incomprehensible, of which power even the maker of the world is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the lawgiver, and Jesus your master.</q></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 50. Simon's Presumption.</h2>

<p>Then Peter:  <span class="quote2"><q>Does it not seem to you to be <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, that any one should take upon himself to assert that there is another God than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all; and should say that he supposes there is a certain power, and should presume to affirm this to others, before he himself is sure of what he says? Is any one so rash as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> your words, of which he sees that you are yourself doubtful, and to admit that there is a certain power unknown to God the Creator, and to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the law, and even to Jesus our Master, which power is so good, that it will not make itself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to any but to one only, and that one such an one as you! Then, further, if that is a new power, why does it not confer upon us some new sense, in addition to those five which we possess, that by that new sense, bestowed upon us by it, we may be able to receive and understand itself which is new? Or if it cannot bestow such a sense upon us, how has it bestowed it upon you? Or if it has revealed itself to you, why not also to us? But if you of yourself understand things which not even the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were able to perceive or understand, come, tell us what each one of us is thinking now; for if there is such a spirit in you that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> those things which are above the heavens, which are unknown to all, and incomprehensible by all, much more easily do you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the thoughts of men upon the earth. But if you cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the thoughts of us who are standing here, how can you say that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> those things which, you assert, are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to none?</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 51. The Sixth Sense.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>But <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me, that you could never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what light is unless you had received both vision and understanding from light itself; so also in other things. Hence, having received understanding, you are framing in imagination something greater and more sublime, as if dreaming, but deriving all your hints from those five senses, to whose Giver you are unthankful. But be sure of this, that until you find some new sense which is beyond those five which we all enjoy, you cannot assert the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a new God.</q></span> Then Simon answered: <span class="quote2"><q>Since all things that exist are in accordance with those five senses, that power which is more excellent than all cannot add anything new.</q></span> Then Peter said: <span class="quote2"><q>It is false; for there is also a sixth sense, namely that of foreknowledge: for those five senses are capable of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but the sixth is that of foreknowledge: and this the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> possessed. How, then, can you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a God who is unknown to all, who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the prophetic sense, which is that of prescience?</q></span> Then Simon began to say: <span class="quote2"><q>This power of which I speak, incomprehensible and more excellent than all, ay, even than that God who made the world, neither any of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, nor of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, nor of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, nay, nor any creature which subsists by means of God the creator. How, then, could that creator's law teach me that which the creator himself did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, since neither did the law itself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, that it might teach it?</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 52. Reductio Ad Absurdum</h2>

<p>Then Peter said: <span class="quote2"><q>I wonder how you have been able to learn more from the law than the law was able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> or to teach; and how you say that you adduce <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from the law of those things which you are pleased to assert, when you declare that neither the law, nor He who gave the law&mdash; that is, the Creator of the world&mdash; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> those things of which you speak! But this also I wonder at, how you, who alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these things, should be standing here now with us all, circumscribed by the limits of this small court.</q></span> Then Simon, seeing Peter and all the people laughing, said: <span class="quote2"><q>Do you laugh, Peter, while so great and lofty matters are under discussion?</q></span> Then said Peter: <span class="quote2"><q>Be not enraged, Simon, for we are doing no more than keeping our promise: for we are neither shutting our ears, as you said, nor did we take to flight as soon as we heard you propound your unutterable things; but we have not even stirred from the place. For indeed you do not even propound things that have any resemblance to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which might to a certain extent frighten us. Yet, at all events, disclose to us the meaning of this saying, how from the law you have learned of a God whom the law itself does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and of whom He who gave the law is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>.</q></span> Then Simon said: <span class="quote2"><q>If you have done laughing, I shall prove it by clear assertions.</q></span> Then Peter said: <span class="quote2"><q>Assuredly I shall give over, that I may learn from you how you have learned from the law what neither the law nor the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the law Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 53. Simon's Blasphemy.</h2>

<p>Then says Simon: <span class="quote2"><q>Listen: it is manifest to all, and ascertained in a manner of which no account can be given,  that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, who is better than all, from whom all that is took its beginning; whence also of necessity, all things that are after him are subject to him, as the chief and most excellent of all. When, therefore, I had ascertained that the God who created the world, according to what the law teaches, is in many respects weak, whereas weakness is utterly incompatible with a perfect <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and I saw that he is not perfect, I necessarily concluded that there is another God who is perfect.  For this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as I have said, according to what the writing of the law teaches, is shown to be weak in many things. In the first place, because the man whom he formed was not able to remain such as he had intended him to be; and because he cannot be good who gave a law to the first man, that he should eat of all the trees of paradise, but that he should not touch the tree of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and if he should eat of it, he should die. For why should he forbid him to eat, and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, he might shun the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and choose the good? But this he did not permit; and because he ate in violation of the commandment, and discovered what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and learned for the sake of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to cover his nakedness (for he perceived it to be unseemly to stand naked before his Creator), he condemns to death him who had learned to do <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and curses the serpent who had shown him these things. But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, if man was to be injured by this means, why did he place the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of injury in paradise at all? But if that which he placed in paradise was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is not the part of one that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to restrain another from good.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 54. How Simon Learned from the Law What the Law Does Not Teach.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>Thus then, since he who made man and the world is, according to what the law relates, imperfect, we are given to understand, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that there is another who is perfect. For it is of necessity that there be one most excellent of all, on whose account also every creature keeps its rank. Whence also I, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is every way necessary that there be some one more benignant and more powerful than that imperfect God who gave the law, understanding what is perfect from comparison of the imperfect, understood even from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> that God who is not mentioned there. And in this way I was able, O Peter, to learn from the law what the law did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. But even if the law had not given indications from which it might be gathered that the God who made the world is imperfect, it was still possible for me to infer from those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which are done in this world, and are not corrected, either that its creator is powerless, if he cannot correct what is done amiss; or else, if he does not wish to remove the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, that he is himself <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but if he neither can nor will, that he is neither powerful nor good. And from this it cannot but be concluded that there is another God more excellent and more powerful than all. If you have anything to say to this, say on.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 55. Simon's Objections Turned Against Himself.</h2>

<p>Peter answered: <span class="quote2"><q>O Simon, they are wont to conceive such absurdities against God who do not read the law with the instruction of masters, but account themselves teachers, and think that they can understand the law, though he has not explained it to them who has learned of the Master.  Nevertheless now, that we also may seem to follow the book of the law according to your apprehension of it; inasmuch as you say that the creator of the world is shown to be both impotent and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, how is it that you do not see that that power of yours, which you say is superior to all, fails and lies under the very same charges? For the very same thing may be said of it, that it is either powerless, since it does not correct those things which here are done amiss; or if it can and will not, it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; or if it neither can nor will, then it is both impotent and imperfect. Whence that new power of yours is not only found liable to a similar charge, but even to a worse one, if, in addition to all these things, it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be, when it is not. For He who created the world, His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is manifest by His very operation in creating the world, as you yourself also confess. But this power which you say that you alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, affords no indication of itself, by which we might perceive, at least, that it is, and subsists.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 56. No God Above the Creator.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>What kind of conduct, then, would it be that we should forsake <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whose world we live and enjoy all things necessary for life, and follow I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whom, from whom we not only obtain no good, but cannot even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he exists? Nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> does he exist. For whether you call him light, and brighter than that light which we see, you borrow that very name from the Creator of the world; or whether you say that he is a substance above all, you derive from Him the idea with enlargement of speech.  Whether you make mention of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or goodness, or life, or whatever else, you borrow the words from Him. Since, then, you have nothing new concerning  that power you speak of, not only as regards understanding, but even in respect of naming him, how do you introduce a new <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for whom you cannot even find a new name? For not only is the Creator of the world called a Power, but even the ministers of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and all the heavenly host. Do you not then think it better that we should follow our Creator <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as a Father who trains us and endows us as He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how? But if, as you say, there be some God more benignant than all, it is certain that he will not be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with us; or if he be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, he is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For if our God is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and punishes, He is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but righteous, for He corrects and amends His own sons. But he who has no concern with us, if he shall punish us, how should he be good? Inflicting punishments upon us because we have not been drawn by vain imaginations to forsake our own Father and follow him, how can you assert that he is so good, when he cannot be regarded as even just?</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 57. Simon's Inconsistency.</h2>

<p>Then Simon: <span class="quote2"><q>Do you so far <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, Peter, as not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were made by that good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the most excellent of all, but they have been brought down as captives into this world?</q></span> To this Peter answered: <span class="quote2"><q>Then he is not unknown by all, as you said a little while ago; and yet how did the good God permit his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to be taken captive, if he be a power over all?</q></span> Then Simon said: <span class="quote2"><q>He sent God the creator to make the world; and he, when he had made it, gave out that himself was God.</q></span> Then Peter said: <span class="quote2"><q>Then he is not, as you said, unknown to Him who made the world; nor are <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of him, if indeed they were stolen away from him. To whom, then, can he be unknown, if both the Creator of the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him, as having been sent by him; and all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him, as having been violently withdrawn from him? Then, further, I wish you would tell us whether he who sent the creator of the world did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he would not keep <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? For if he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, then he was not prescient; while if he foreknew it, and suffered it, he is himself guilty of this deed, since he did not prevent it; but if he could not, then he is not <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>. But if, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it as good, he did not prohibit it, he is found to be better, who presumed to do that which he who sent him did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be good.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 58. Simon's God Unjust.</h2>

<p>Then Simon said: <span class="quote2"><q>He receives those who will come to him, and does them good.</q></span> Peter answered: <span class="quote2"><q>But there is nothing new in this; for He whom you acknowledge to be the Creator of the world also does so.</q></span> Then Simon: <span class="quote2"><q>But the good God bestows <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> if he is only acknowledged; but the creator of the world demands also that the law be fulfilled.</q></span> Then said Peter: <span class="quote2"><q>He saves adulterers and men-slayers, if they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him; but good, and sober, and merciful <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, if they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him, in consequence of their having no information concerning him, he does not save! Great and good <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is he whom you proclaim, who is not so much the saviour of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as he is one who shows no mercy to the good.</q></span> Then Simon: <span class="quote2"><q>It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> very difficult for man to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him, as long as he is in the flesh; for blacker than all darkness, and heavier than all clay, is this body with which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is surrounded.</q></span> Then says Peter: <span class="quote2"><q>That good God of yours demands things which are difficult; but He who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> God seeks easier things. Let him then, since he is so good, leave us with our Father and Creator; and when once we depart from the body, and leave that darkness that you speak of, we shall more easily <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him; and then the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall better understand that God is its Creator, and shall remain with Him, and shall no more be harassed with diverse imaginations; nor shall wish to betake itself to another power, which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to none but Simon only, and which is of such goodness that no one can come to it, unless he be first guilty of impiety towards his own father! I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how this power can be called either good or just, which no one can please except by acting impiously towards him by whom he was made!</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 59. The Creator Our Father.</h2>

<p>Then Simon: <span class="quote2"><q>It is not impious for the sake of greater profit and advantage to flee to him who is of richer <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q></span> Then Peter: <span class="quote2"><q>If, as you say, it is not impious to flee to a stranger, it is at all events much more <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> to remain with our own father, even if he be poor. But if you do not think it impious to leave our father, and flee to another, as being better than he; and you do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that our Creator will take this amiss; much more the good God will not be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, because, when we were strangers to him, we have not fled to him, but have remained with our own Creator. Yea, I think he will rather commend us the more for this, that we have kept <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with God our Creator; for he will consider that, if we had been his creatures, we should never have been seduced by the allurements of any other to forsake him. For if any one, allured by richer promises, shall leave his own father and betake himself to a stranger, it may be that he will leave him in his turn, and go to another who shall promise him greater things, and this the rather because he is not his son, since he could leave even him who by nature was his father.</q></span> Then Simon said: <span class="quote2"><q>But what if <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are from him, and do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him, and he is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> their father?</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 60. The Creator the Supreme God.</h2>

<p>Then Peter said: <span class="quote2"><q>You represent him as weak enough. For if, as you say, he is more powerful than all, it can never be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the weaker wrenched the spoils from the stronger. <span class="stiki" id="note080667"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;11:22</a></span> Or if God the Creator was able by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to bring down <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> into this world, how can it be that, when they are separated from the body and freed from the bonds of captivity, the good God shall call them to the sufferance of punishment, on the ground that they, either through his remissness or weakness, were dragged away to this place, and were involved in the body, as in the darkness of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>? You seem to me not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what a father and a God is: but I could tell you both whence <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you, who are in such <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in respect of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></span> Then said Simon: <span class="quote2"><q>A time will come when you shall be sorry that you did not understand me speaking of the ineffable power.</q></span> Then said Peter: <span class="quote2"><q>Give us then, as I have often said, as being yourself a new <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or as having yourself come down from him, some new sense, by means of which we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that new God of whom you speak; for those five senses, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> our Creator has given us, keep <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to their own Creator, and do not perceive that there is any other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for so their nature necessitates them.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 61. Imagination.</h2>

<p>To this Simon answered: <span class="quote2"><q>Apply your mind to those things which I am going to say, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it, walking in peaceable paths, to attain to those things which I shall demonstrate. Listen now, therefore. Did you never in thought reach forth your mind into regions or islands situated far away, and remain so fixed in them, that you could not even see the people that were before you, or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> where yourself were sitting, by reason of the delightfulness of those things on which you were gazing?</q></span> And Peter said: <span class="quote2"><q>It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, Simon, this has often occurred to me.</q></span> Then Simon said: <span class="quote2"><q>In this way now reach forth your sense into heaven, yea above the heaven, and behold that there must be some place beyond the world, or outside the world, in which there is neither heaven nor earth, and where no shadow of these things produces darkness; and consequently, since there are neither bodies in it, nor darkness occasioned by bodies, there must of necessity be immense light; and consider of what sort that light must be, which is never succeeded by darkness. For if the light of this sun fills this whole world, how great do you suppose that bodiless and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> light to be? So great, doubtless, that this light of the sun would seem to be darkness and not light, in comparison.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 62. Peter's Experience of Imagination.</h2>

<p>When Simon thus spoke, Peter answered:  <span class="quote2"><q>Now listen patiently concerning both these matters, that is, concerning the example of stretching out the senses, and concerning the immensity of light. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I myself, O Simon, have sometimes in thought extended my sense, as you say, into regions and islands situated afar off, and have seen them with my mind not less than if it had been with my eyes. When I was at Capernaum, occupied in the taking of fishes, and sat upon a rock, holding in my hand a hook attached to a line, and fitted for deceiving the fishes, <em>I was so absorbed</em> that I did not feel a fish adhering to it while my mind eagerly ran through my beloved Jerusalem, to which I had frequently gone up, waking, for the sake of offerings and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. But I was accustomed also to admire this C&aelig;sarea, hearing of it from others, and to long to see it; and I seemed to myself to see it, although I had never been in it; and I thought of it what was suitable to be thought of a great city, its gates, walls, baths, streets, lanes, markets, and the like, in accordance with what I had seen in other cities; and to such an extent was I delighted with the intentness of such inspection, that, as you said, I neither saw one who was present and standing by me, nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> where myself was sitting.</q></span> Then said Simon: <span class="quote2"><q>Now you say well.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 63. Peter's Reverie.</h2>

<p>Then Peter: <span class="quote2"><q>In short, when I did not perceive, through the occupation of my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that I had caught a very large fish which was attached to the hook, and that although it was dragging the hook-line from my hand, my brother Andrew, who was sitting by me, seeing me in a reverie and almost ready to fall, thrusting his elbow into my side as if he would awaken me from sleep, said: 'Do you not see, Peter, what a large fish you have caught? Are you out of your senses, that you are thus in a stupor of astonishment? Tell me, What is the matter with you?' But I was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with him for a little, because he had withdrawn me from the delight of those things which I was contemplating; then I answered that I was not suffering from any malady, but that I was mentally gazing on the beloved Jerusalem, and at the same time on C&aelig;sarea; and that, while I was indeed with him in the body, in my mind I was wholly carried away there. But he, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whence inspired, uttered a hidden and secret word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 64. Andrew's Rebuke.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->'Give over,' says he, 'O Peter. What is it that you are doing? For those who are beginning to be possessed with a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, or to be disturbed in their minds, begin in this way. They are first carried away by fancies to some pleasant and delightful things, then they are poured out in vain and fond motions towards things which have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Now this happens from a certain disease of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, by reason of which they see not the things which are, but long to bring to their sight those which are not. But thus it happens also to those who are suffering phrenzy, and seem to themselves to see many images, because their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, being torn and withdrawn from its place by excess of cold or of heat, suffers a failure of its natural service. But those also who are in distress through thirst, when they fall asleep, seem to themselves to see rivers and fountains, and to drink; but this befalls them through being distressed by the dryness of the unmoistened body. Wherefore it is certain that this occurs through some ailment either of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or body.'</p>

<h2>Chapter 65. Fallacy of Imagination.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>In short, that you may receive the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the matter; concerning Jerusalem, which I had often seen, I told my brother what places and what gatherings of people I had seemed to myself to see. But also concerning C&aelig;sarea, which I had never seen, I nevertheless contended that it was such as I had conceived it in my mind and thought. But when I came hither, and saw nothing at all like to those things which I had seen in phantasy, I blamed myself, and observed distinctly, that I had assigned to it gates, and walls, and buildings from others which I had seen, taking the likeness in reality from others. Nor indeed can any one <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> anything new, and of which no form has ever <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. For even if any one should fashion from his imagination bulls with five heads, he only forms them with five heads out of those which he has seen with one head. And you therefore, now, if <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> you seem to yourself to perceive anything with your thought, and to look above the heavens, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> them from those things which you see, placed as you are upon the earth. But if you think that there is easy access for your mind above the heavens, and that you are able to conceive the things that are there, and to apprehend <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that immense light, I think that for him who can comprehend these things, it were easier to throw his sense, which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to ascend there, into the heart and breast of some one of us who stand by, and to tell what thoughts he is cherishing in his breast. If therefore you can declare the thoughts of the heart of any one of us, who is not pre-engaged in your favour, we shall perhaps be able to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you, that you are able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> those things that are above the heavens, although these are much loftier.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 66. Existence and Conception.</h2>

<p>To this Simon replied:  <span class="quote2"><q>O you who has woven a web of many frivolities, listen now. It is impossible that anything which comes into a man's thoughts should not also subsist in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and reality. For things that do not subsist, have no appearances;  but things that have no appearances, cannot present themselves to our thoughts.</q></span> Then said Peter: <span class="quote2"><q>If everything that can come into our thoughts has a subsistence, then, with respect to that place of immensity which you say is outside the world, if one thinks in his heart that it is light, and another that it is darkness, how can one and the same place be both light and darkness, according to their different thoughts concerning it?</q></span> Then said Simon: <span class="quote2"><q>Let pass for the present what I have said; and tell us what you suppose to be above the heavens.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 67. The Law Teaches of Immensity.</h2>

<p>Then said Peter: <span class="quote2"><q>If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fountain of light, I could instruct you what and of what sort is that which is immense, and should render, not a vain fancy, but a consistent and necessary account of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and should make use, not of sophistical assertions, but testimonies of the law and nature, that you might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the law especially contains what we ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in regard to immensity. But if the doctrine of immensity is not unknown to the law, then assuredly, nought else can be unknown to it; and therefore it is a false supposition of yours, that there is anything of which the law is not cognisant. Much more shall nothing be unknown to Him who gave the law. Yet I cannot speak anything to you of immensity and of those things which are without limit, unless first you either accept our account of those heavens which are bounded by a certain limit, or else propound your own account of them. But if you cannot understand concerning those which are comprehended within fixed boundaries, much more can you neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nor learn anything concerning those which are without limit.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 68. The Visible and the Invisible Heaven.</h2>

<p>To this Simon answered: <span class="quote2"><q>It seems to me to be better to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> simply that God is, and that that heaven which we see is the only heaven in the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>.</q></span> But Peter said: <span class="quote2"><q>Not so; but it is proper to confess one God who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is; but that there are heavens, which were made by Him, as also the law says, of which one is the higher, in which also is contained the visible firmament; and that that higher heaven is perpetual and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, with those who dwell in it; but that this visible heaven is to be dissolved and to pass away at the end of the world, in order that that heaven which is older and higher may appear after the judgment to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and the worthy.</q></span> To this Simon answered: <span class="quote2"><q>That these things are so, as you say, may appear to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them; but to him who seeks for reasons of these things, it is impossible that they can be produced from the law, and especially concerning the immensity of light.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 69. Faith and Reason.</h2>

<p>Then Peter: <span class="quote2"><q>Do not think that we say that these things are only to be received by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but also that they are to be asserted by reason. For indeed it is not safe to commit these things to bare <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without reason, since assuredly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> cannot be without reason. And therefore he who has received these things fortified by reason, can never lose them; whereas he who receives them without <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, by an assent to a simple statement of them, can neither keep them safely, nor is certain if they are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; because he who easily believes, also easily yields. But he who has sought reason for those things which he has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and received, as though bound by chains of reason itself, can never be torn away or separated from those things which he has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. And therefore, according as any one is more anxious in demanding a reason, by so much will he be the firmer in preserving his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 70. Adjournment.</h2>

<p>To this Simon replied: <span class="quote2"><q>It is a great thing which you promise, that the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of boundless light can be shown from the law.</q></span> And when Peter said, <span class="quote2"><q>I shall show it whenever you please,</q></span> Simon answered: <span class="quote2"><q>Since now it is a late hour, I shall stand by you and oppose you tomorrow; and if you can prove that this world was created, and that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, you shall have me to assist you in your preaching.</q></span> When he had said thus, he departed, and was followed by a third part of all the people who had come with him, who were about one thousand men. But the rest with bended knees prostrated themselves before Peter; and he, invoking upon them the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cured some who had <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, healed others who were sick, and so dismissed the people rejoicing, commanding them to come early the next day. But Peter, when the crowds had withdrawn, commanded the table to be spread on the ground, in the open air, in the court where the disputation had been held, and sat down together with those eleven; but I dined reclining with some others who also had made a beginning of hearing the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and were greatly beloved.</p>

<h2>Chapter 71. Separation from the Unclean.</h2>

<p>But Peter, most benignantly regarding me, lest haply that separation might <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> me sorrow, says to me: <span class="quote2"><q>It is not from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, O Clement, that I do not eat with those who have not yet been purified; but I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest perhaps I should injure myself, and do no good to them.  For this I would have you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain, that every one who has at any time worshipped <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and has adored those whom the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> call gods, or has eaten of the things <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to them, is not without an unclean spirit; for he has become a guest of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and has been partaker with that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> of which he has formed the image in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, either through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note080672"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:20</a></span> And by these means he is not free from an unclean spirit, and therefore needs the purification of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, that the unclean spirit may go out of him, which has made its abode in the inmost affections of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and what is worse, gives no indication that it lurks within, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> it should be exposed and expelled.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 72. The Remedy.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>For these unclean spirits <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to dwell in the bodies of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that they may fulfil their own desires by their service, and, inclining the motions of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to those things which they themselves desire, may compel them to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> their own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, that they may become wholly vessels of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.  One of whom is this Simon, who is seized with such disease, and cannot now be healed, because he is sick in his will and purpose. Nor does the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> dwell in him against his will; and therefore, if any one would drive it out of him, since it is inseparable from himself, and, so to speak, has now become his very <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he should seem rather to kill him, and to incur the guilt of manslaughter. Let no one of you therefore be saddened at being separated from eating with us, for every one ought to observe that it is for just so long a time as he pleases. For he who wishes soon to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is separated but for a little time, but he for a longer who wishes to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> later. Every one therefore has it in his own power to demand a shorter or a longer time for his repentance; and therefore it lies with you, when you wish it, to come to our table; and not with us, who are not permitted to take food with any one who has not been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. It is rather you, therefore, who hinder us from eating with you, if you interpose delays in the way of your purification, and defer your <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</q></span> Having said thus, and having blessed, he took food. And afterwards, when he had given thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he went into the house and went to bed; and we all did the like, for it was now night.</p>
