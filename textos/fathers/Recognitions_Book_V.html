<h1>Recognitions (Book V)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. Peter's Salutation.</h2>

<p>But on the following day,  Peter rising a little earlier than usual, found us asleep; and when he saw it, he gave orders that silence should be kept for him, as though he himself wished to sleep longer, that we might not be disturbed in our rest. But when we rose refreshed with sleep, we found him, having finished his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, waiting for us in his bed-chamber. And as it was already dawn, he addressed us shortly, saluting us according to his custom, and immediately proceeded to the usual place for the purpose of teaching; and when he saw that many had assembled there, having invoked peace upon them according to the first religious form, he began to speak as follows:&mdash; </p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Suffering the Effect of Sin.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>--><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator of all, at the beginning made man after His own image, and gave him dominion over the earth and sea, and over the air; as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Prophet has told us, and as the very reason of things instructs us: for man alone is rational, and it is fitting that reason should rule over the irrational. At first, therefore, while he was still righteous, he was superior to all disorders and all frailty; but when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, as we taught you yesterday, and became the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he became at the same time liable to frailty. This therefore is written, that men may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, as by impiety they have been made liable to suffer, so by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> they may be made free from suffering; and not only free from suffering, but by even a little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be able to cure the sufferings of others. For thus the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Prophet promised us, saying, 'Verily I say to you, that if you have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove hence, and it shall remove.' <span class="stiki" id="note080752"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;17:20</a></span> Of this saving you have yourselves also had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>; for you saw yesterday how at our presence the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> removed and were put to flight, with those sufferings which they had brought upon men.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Faith and Unbelief.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Whereas therefore some men suffer, and others cure those who suffer, it is necessary to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> at once of the suffering and the cure; and this is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be nought else than unbelief on the part of the sufferers, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the part of those who cure them. For unbelief, while it does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is to be a judgment by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, affords licence to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> makes men liable to sufferings; but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, believing that there is to be a judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, restrains men from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and those who do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are not only free from <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and sufferings, but can also put to flight the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and sufferings of others.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Ignorance the Mother of Evils.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->From  all these things, therefore, it is concluded that all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> springs from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> herself, the mother of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, is sprung from carelessness and sloth, and is nourished, and increased, and rooted in the senses of men by negligence; and if any one teach that she is to be put to flight, she is with difficulty and indignantly torn away, as from an ancient and hereditary abode. And therefore we must labour for a little, that we may search out the presumptions of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and cut them off by means of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, especially in those who are preoccupied with some erroneous opinions, by means of which <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is the more firmly rooted in them, as under the appearance of a certain kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for nothing is worse than for one to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of, and to maintain that to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which is false. This is as if a drunk man should think himself to be sober, and should act indeed in all respects as a <em>drunk</em> man, and yet think himself to be sober, and should wish to be called so by others. Thus, therefore, are those also who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, yet hold some appearance of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and do many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things as if they were good, and hasten destruction as if it were to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Advantages of Knowledge.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Wherefore we must, above all things, hasten to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that, as with a light kindled thereat, we may be able to dispel the darkness of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>: for <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, as we have said, is a great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but because it has no substance, it is easily dispelled by those who are in earnest. For <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is nothing else than not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for us; once <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> perishes. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> ought to be eagerly sought after; and no one can confer it except the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Prophet. For this is the gate of life to those who will enter, and the road of good works to those going to the city of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Free-Will.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Whether any one, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> hearing the word of of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Prophet; is willing or unwilling to receive it, and to embrace His burden, that is, the precepts of life, he has either in his power, for we are free in will.  For if it were so, that those who hear had it not in their power to do otherwise than they had heard, there were some power of nature in virtue of which it were not free to him to pass over to another opinion. Or if, again, no one of the hearers could at all receive it, this also were a power of nature which should compel the doing of some one thing, and should leave no place for the other course. But now, since it is free for the mind to turn its judgment to which side it pleases, and to choose the way which it approves, it is clearly manifest that there is in men a liberty of choice.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Responsibility of Knowledge.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Therefore, before any one hears what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for him, it is certain that he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>; and being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, he wishes and desires to do what is not good for him; wherefore he is not judged for that. But when once he has heard the causes of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and has received the method of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, then, if he remain in those <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> with which he had been long ago preoccupied, he shall rightly be called into judgment, to suffer punishment, because he has spent in the sport of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> that portion of life which was given him to be spent in living well. But he who, hearing those things, willingly receives them, and is thankful that the teaching of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things has been brought to him, inquires more eagerly, and does not cease to learn, until he ascertains whether there be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> another world, in which rewards are prepared for the good. And when he is assured of this, he gives thanks to God because He has shown him the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and for the future directs his actions in all good works, for which he is assured that there is a reward prepared in the world to come; while he constantly wonders and is astonished at the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of other men, and that no one sees the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is placed before his eyes. Yet he himself, rejoicing in the riches of wisdom which he has found, desires insatiably to enjoy them, and is delighted with the practice of good works; hastening to attain, with a clean heart and a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, the world to come, when he shall be able even to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the king of all.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Desires of the Flesh to Be Subdued.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But the sole <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our wanting and being deprived of all these things is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. For while men do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how much good there is in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, they do not suffer the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to be removed from them; for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how great a difference is involved in the change of one of these things for the other. Wherefore I counsel every learner willingly to lend his ear to the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to hear with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> what we say, that his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, receiving the best seed, may bring forth joyful fruits by good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. For if, while I teach the things which pertain to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, any one refuses to receive them, and strives to resist them with a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> occupied by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> opinions, he shall have the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his perishing, not from us, but from himself. For it is his duty to examine with just judgment the things which we say, and to understand that we speak the words of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how things are, and directing his life in good actions, he may be found a partaker of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, subjecting to himself the desires of the flesh, and becoming lord of them, that so at length he himself also may become the pleasant possession of the Ruler of all.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. The Two Kingdoms.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->For he who persists in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and is the servant of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, cannot be made a portion of good so long as he persists in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because from the beginning, as we have said, God instituted two kingdoms, and has given to each man the power of becoming a portion of that kingdom to which he shall yield himself to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>. And since it is decreed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that no one man can be a servant of both kingdoms, therefore endeavour with all earnestness to betake yourselves to the covenant and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the good King. Wherefore also the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Prophet, when He was present with us, and saw some rich men negligent with respect to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thus unfolded the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this matter: 'No one,' said He, 'can serve two masters; ye cannot serve God and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>;' <span class="stiki" id="note080755"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;6:24</a></span> calling riches, in the language of His country, <em><a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a></em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Jesus the True Prophet.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->He therefore is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Prophet, who appeared to us, as you have heard, in Jud&aelig;a, who, standing in public places, by a simple command made the blind see, the deaf hear, cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, restored health to the sick, and life to the dead; and since nothing was impossible to Him, He even perceived the thoughts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which is possible for none but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only. He proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>; and we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Him as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Prophet in all that He spoke, deriving the confirmation of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> not only from His words, but also from His works; and also because the sayings of the law, which many generations before had set forth His coming, were fulfilled in Him; and the figures of the doings of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and of the patriarch Jacob before him, bore in all respects a type of Him. It is evident also that the time of His advent, that is, the very time at which He came, was foretold by them; and, above all, it was contained in the sacred writings, that He was to be waited for by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. And all these things were equally fulfilled in Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. The Expectation of the Gentiles.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But that which a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> foretold, that He was to be waited for by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,  confirms above measure the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in Him. For if he had said that He was to be waited for by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, he would not have seemed to prophesy anything extraordinary, that He whose coming had been promised for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the world should be the object of hope to the people of the same tribe with Himself, and to His own nation: for that this would take place, would seem rather to be a matter of natural inference than one requiring the grandeur of a prophetic utterance. But now, whereas the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> say that all that hope which is set forth concerning the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the world, and the newness of the kingdom which is to be established by Christ, and all things which are declared concerning Him are to be transferred to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; the grandeur of the prophetic office is confirmed, not according to the sequence of things, but by an incredible fulfilment of the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from the beginning had understood by a most certain tradition that this man should at some time come, by whom all things should be restored; and daily meditating and looking out for His coming, when they saw Him among them, and accomplishing the signs and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, as had been written of Him, being blinded with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, they could not recognise Him when present, in the hope of whom they rejoiced while He was absent; yet the few of us who were chosen by Him understood it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Call of the Gentiles.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But this happened by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this good One should be handed over to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and those who had never heard of Him, nor had learned from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, should acknowledge Him, while those who had acknowledged Him in their daily meditations should not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. For, behold, by you who are now present, and desire to hear the doctrine of His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what, and how, and of what sort is His coming, the prophetic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is fulfilled. For this is what the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> foretold, that He is to be sought for by you, who never heard of Him. <span class="stiki" id="note080757"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;65:1</a></span> And, therefore, seeing that the prophetic sayings are fulfilled even in yourselves, you rightly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him alone, you rightly wait for Him, you rightly inquire concerning Him, that you not only may wait for Him, but also believing, you may obtain the inheritance of His kingdom; according to what Himself said, that every one is made the servant of him to whom he yields subjection. <span class="stiki" id="note080758"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;8:34</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Invitation of the Gentiles.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Wherefore awake, and take to yourselves our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even that Lord who is Lord both of heaven and earth, and conform yourselves to His image and likeness, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Prophet Himself teaches, saying, 'Be merciful, as also your heavenly Father is merciful, who makes His sun to rise upon the good and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and rains upon the just and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.'  Imitate Him, therefore, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him, as the commandment is given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, 'You shall worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him only shall you serve.'  For it is profitable to you to serve this Lord alone, that through Him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you may be freed from the many whom you vainly feared. For he who fears not God the Creator of all, but fears those whom he himself with his own hands has made, what does he do but make himself subject to a vain and senseless <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and render himself more vile and abject than those very things, the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of which he has conceived in his mind? But rather, by the goodness of Him who invites you, return to your former nobleness, and by good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> show that you bear the image of your Creator, that by <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of His likeness ye may be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be even His sons.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Idols Unprofitable.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Begin,  therefore, to cast out of your minds the vain ideas of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and your useless and empty fears, that at the same time you may also escape the condition of unrighteous bondage. For those have become your lords, who could not even have been profitable servants to you. For how should lifeless images seem fit even to serve you, when they can neither hear, nor see, nor feel anything? Yea, even the material of which they are made, whether it be gold or silver, or even brass or wood, though it might have profited you for necessary uses, you have rendered wholly inefficient and useless by fashioning gods out of it. We therefore declare to you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and at the same time warn and exhort the worshippers, that by good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> they imitate Him whom they worship, and hasten to return to His image and likeness, as we said before.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Folly of Idolatry.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But I should like if those who worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> would tell me if they wish to become like those whom they worship? Does any one of you wish to see in such sort as they see? Or to hear after the manner of their hearing? Or to have such understanding as they have? Far be this from any of my hearers! For this were rather to be thought a curse and a reproach to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who bears in himself the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although he has lost the likeness. What sort of gods, then, are they to be reckoned, the imitation of whom would be execrable to their worshippers, and to have whose likeness would be a reproach? What then? Melt your useless images, and make useful vessels. Melt the unserviceable and inactive metal, and make implements fit for the use of men. But, says one, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> do not allow us.  He says well; for it is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and not their own power, that prevents it. What kind of gods, then, are those which are defended by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and not by their own energies? And so also they are preserved from thieves by watch-dogs and the protection of bolts, at least if they be of silver, or gold, or even of brass; for those that are of stone and earthenware are protected by their own worthlessness, for no one will steal a stone or a crockery god. Hence those seem to be the more miserable whose more precious metal exposes them to the greater danger. Since, then, they can be stolen, since they must be guarded by men, since they can be melted, and weighed out, and forged with hammers, ought men possessed of understanding to hold them as gods?</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. God Alone a Fit Object of Worship.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Oh! Into what wretched plight the understanding of men has fallen! For if it is reckoned the greatest folly to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the dead, what shall we judge of those who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> something that is worse than the dead are? For those images are not even to be reckoned among the number of the dead, because they were never alive. Even the sepulchres of the dead are preferable to them, since, although they are now dead, yet they once had life; but those whom you worship never possessed even such base life as is in all, the life of frogs and owls. But why say more about them, since it is enough to say to him who adores them: Do you not see that he whom you adore sees not, hear that he whom you adore hears not, and understand that he understands not?&mdash; for he is the work of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> hand, and necessarily is void of understanding. You therefore worship a god without sense, whereas every one who has sense believes that not even those things are to be worshipped which have been made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and have sense,  such as the sun, moon, and stars, and all things that are in heaven and upon earth. For they think it reasonable, that not those things which have been made for the service of the world, but the Creator of those things themselves, and of the whole world, should be worshipped. For even these things <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> when He is adored and worshipped, and do not take it well that the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Creator should be bestowed on the creature. For the worship of God alone is acceptable <em>to them</em>, who alone is uncreated, and all things also are His creatures. For as it belongs to him who alone is uncreated to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so everything that has been created is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17. Suggestions of the Old Serpent.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Above all, therefore, you ought to understand the deception of the old serpent  and his cunning suggestions, who deceives you as it were by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and as by a sort of reason creeps through your senses; and beginning at the head, he glides through your inner marrow, accounting the deceiving of you a great gain. Therefore he insinuates into your minds opinions of gods of whatsoever kinds, only that he may withdraw you from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of one God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is his comfort. For he, for his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, was condemned from the beginning to eat dust, for that he caused to be again resolved into dust him who had been taken from the dust, even till the time when your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> shall be restored, being brought through the fire; as we shall instruct you more fully at another time. From him, therefore, proceed all the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and doubts, by which you are driven from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and belief of one God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. His First Suggestion.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->And first of all he suggests to men's thoughts not to hear the words of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, by which they might put to flight the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of those things which are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. And this he does, as by the presentation of another <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, making a show of that opinion which very many hold, to think that they shall not be held guilty if they have been in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and that they shall not be called to account for what they have not heard; and thereby he persuades them to turn aside from hearing the word. But I tell you, in opposition to this, that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is in itself a most deadly poison, which is sufficient to ruin the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> without any aid from without. And therefore there is no one who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> who shall escape through his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but it is certain that he shall perish. For the power of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> naturally destroys the sinner. But since the judgment shall be according to reason, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and origin of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> shall be inquired into, as well as of every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For he who is unwilling to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how he may attain to life, and prefers to be in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> lest he thereby be made guilty, from this very fact is judged as if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> and had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what it was that he was unwilling to hear; and the cunning obtained by the artifice of the serpent will avail him nothing for an excuse, for he will have to do with Him to whom the heart is open. But that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of itself brings destruction, <em>I assure you that</em> when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> departs from the body, if it leave it in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of Him by whom it was created, and from whom in this world it obtained all things that were necessary for its uses, it is driven forth from the light of His kingdom as ungrateful and unfaithful.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19. His Second Suggestion.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Again, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> serpent suggests another opinion to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which many of you are in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of bringing forward,&mdash; that there is, as we say, one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is Lord of all; but these also, they say, are gods. For as there is one C&aelig;sar, and he has under him many judges,&mdash; for example, prefects, consuls, tribunes, and other officers,&mdash; in like manner we think, that while there is one God greater than all, yet still that these gods are ordained in this world, after the likeness of those officers of whom we have spoken, subject indeed to that greater <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet ruling us and the things that are in this world. In answer to this, I shall show you how, in those very things which you propose for deception, you are confuted by the reasons of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. You say that God occupies the place of C&aelig;sar, and those who are called gods represent His judges and officers. Hold then, as you have adduced it, by the example of C&aelig;sar; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, as one of C&aelig;sar's judges or administrators, as prefects, proconsuls, generals, or tribunes, may lawfully take the name of C&aelig;sar,&mdash; or else both he who should take it and those who should confer it should be destroyed together,&mdash; so also in this case you ought to observe, that if any one give the name of God to any but Himself, and he accept it, they shall partake one and the same destruction, by a much more terrible <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> than the servants of C&aelig;sar. For he who offends against C&aelig;sar shall undergo temporal destruction; but he who offends against Him who is the sole and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall suffer <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, and that deservedly, as having injured by a wrongful condition the name which is unique. </p>

<h2>Chapter 20. Egyptian Idolatry.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>Although this word God is not the <em>name</em> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but meantime that word is employed by men as His name; and therefore, as I have said, when it is used reproachfully, the reproach is referred to the injury of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> name. In short, the ancient Egyptians, who thought that they had discovered the theory of the heavenly revolutions and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the stars, nevertheless, through the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon's</a> blocking up their senses, subjected the incommunicable name to all kinds of indignity. For some taught that their ox, which is called Apis, ought to be worshipped; others taught that the he-goat, others that cats, the ibis, a fish also, a serpent, onions, drains, crepitus ventris, ought to be regarded as deities, and innumerable other things, which I am ashamed even to mention.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 21. Egyptian Idolatry More Reasonable Than Others.</h2>

<p>When Peter was speaking thus, all we who heard him laughed. Then said Peter: <!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->You laugh at the absurdities of others, because through long custom you do not see your own. For indeed it is not without reason that you laugh at the folly of the Egyptians, who worship dumb animals, while they themselves are rational. But I will tell you how they also laugh at you; for they say, We worship living animals, though mortal; but you worship and adore things which never were alive at all. They add this also, that they are figures and allegories of certain powers by whose help the race of men is governed. Taking refuge in this for shame, they fabricate these and similar excuses, and so endeavour to screen their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. But this is not the time to answer the Egyptians, and leaving the care of those who are present to heal the disease of the absent. For it is a certain indication that you are held to be free from sickness of this sort, since you do not grieve over it as your own, but laugh at it as that of others.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22. Second Suggestion Continued.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But let us come back to you, whose opinion it is that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be regarded as C&aelig;sar, and the gods as the ministers and deputies of C&aelig;sar. Follow me attentively, and I shall presently show you the lurking-places of the serpent, which lie in the crooked windings of this argument. It ought to be regarded by all as certain and beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that no creature can be on a level with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He was made by none, but Himself made all things; nor indeed can any one be found so irrational, as to suppose that the thing made can be compared with the maker. If therefore the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, not only by reason, but even by a sort of natural instinct, rightly holds this opinion, that that is called God to which nothing can be compared or equalled, but which exceeds all and excels all; how can it be supposed that that name which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be above all, is rightly given to those whom you think to be employed for the service and comfort of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life? But we shall add this also. This world was undoubtedly made, and is corruptible, as we shall show more fully by and by; meantime it is admitted both that it has been made and that it is corruptible. If therefore the world cannot be called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and rightly so, because it is corruptible, how shall parts of the world take the name of God? For inasmuch as the whole world cannot be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, much more its parts cannot. Therefore, if we come back to the example of C&aelig;sar, you will see how far you are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. It is not lawful for any one, though a man of the same nature with him, to be compared with C&aelig;sar: do you think, then, that any one ought to be compared with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who excels all in this respect, that He was made by none, but Himself made all things? But, indeed, you dare not give the name of C&aelig;sar to any other, because he immediately punishes one who offends against him; you dare give that of God to others, because He delays the punishment of offenders against Him, in order to their repentance.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23. Third Suggestion.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Through the mouths of others also that serpent is wont to speak in this wise: We adore visible images in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the invisible God.  Now this is most certainly false. For if you really wished to worship the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you would do good to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and so worship the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in him. For the image of God is in every man, though His likeness is not in all, but where the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is benign and the mind pure. If, therefore, you wish <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we declare to you what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that you should do good to and pay <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and reverence to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is made in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that you minister food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothing to the naked, hospitality to the stranger, and necessary things to the prisoner; and that is what will be regarded as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> bestowed upon God. And so far do these things go to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of God's image, that he who does not these things is regarded as casting reproach upon the divine image. What, then, is that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of God which consists in running from one stone or wooden figure to another, in venerating empty and lifeless figures as deities, and despising men in whom the image of God is of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Yea, rather be assured, that whoever commits <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, or anything that causes suffering or injury to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in all these the image of God is violated. For to injure men is a great impiety towards God. Whenever, therefore, you do to another what you would not have another do to you, you defile the image of God with undeserved distresses. Understand, therefore, that that is the suggestion of the serpent lurking within you, which persuades you that you may seem to be <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> when you worship insensible things, and may not seem impious when you injure sensible and rational beings.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24. Fourth Suggestion.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But to these things the serpent answers us with another mouth, and says: If God did not wish these things to be, then they should not be. I am not telling you how it is that many contrary things are permitted to be in this world for the probation of every one's mind. But this is what is suitable to be said in the meantime: If, according to you, everything that was to be worshipped ought not to have been, there would have been almost nothing in this world. For what is there that you have left without worshipping it? The sun, the moon, the stars, the water, the earth, mountains, trees, stones, men; there is no one of these that you have not worshipped. According to your saying, therefore, none of these ought to have been made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you might not have anything that you could worship! Yea, He ought not even to have made men themselves to be the worshippers! But this is the very thing which that serpent which lurks within you desires: for he spares none of you; he would have no one of you escape from destruction. But it shall not be so. For I tell you, that not that which is worshipped is in fault, but he who worships. For with God is righteous judgment; and He judges in one way the sufferer, and in another way the doer, of wrong.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25. Fifth Suggestion.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But you say: Then those who adore what ought not to be adored, should be immediately destroyed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to prevent others doing the like. But are you wiser than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you should offer Him counsel? <span class="stiki" id="note080767"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse34">Romans&nbsp;11:34</a></span> He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what to do. For with all who are placed in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> He exercises patience, because He is merciful and gracious; and He foresees that many of the ungodly become godly, and that even some of those who worship impure <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> and polluted images have been converted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and forsaking their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and doing good works, attain to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But it is said: We ought never to have come even to the thought of doing these things. You do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what freedom of will is, and you forget that he is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> who is so by his own intention; but, he who is retained in goodness by necessity cannot be called good, because it is not of himself that he is so. Because, therefore, there is in every one liberty to choose good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he either acquires rewards, or brings destruction on himself. Nay it is said, God brings to our minds whatsoever we think. What mean ye, O men? You <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>. For if He brings all our thoughts into our minds, then it is He that suggests to us thoughts of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and every kind of effeminacy. Cease, I entreat of you, these <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, and understand what is the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And say not, as some of you are wont to say, that God needs not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> from men. Indeed, He <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is in need of none; but you ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which you bestow upon God is profitable to yourselves. For what is so execrable, as for a man not to render thanks to his Creator?</p>

<h2>Chapter 26. Sixth Suggestion.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But it is said: We do better, who give thanks both to Himself, and to all with Him. In this you do not understand that there is the ruin of your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For it is as if a sick man should call in for his cure at once a physician and poisoners; since these could indeed injure him, but not cure him; and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> physician would refuse to mix his remedies with their poisons, lest either the man's destruction should be ascribed to the good, or his recovery, to the injurious. But you say: Is God then indignant or <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, if, when He benefits us, our thanks be rendered to others? Even if He be not indignant, at all events He does not wish to be the author of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, that by means of His work credit should be given to a vain idol. And what is so impious, so ungrateful, as to obtain a benefit from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to render thanks to blocks of wood and stone? Wherefore arise, and understand your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For God is in need of no one, nor does He require anything, nor is He hurt by anything; but we are either helped or hurt, in that we are grateful or ungrateful. For what does God gain from our praises, or what does He lose by our <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>? Only this we must remember, that God brings into proximity and friendship with Himself the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that renders thanks to Him. But the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> possesses the ungrateful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27. Creatures Take Vengeance on Sinners.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But this also I would have you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that upon such <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> God does not take vengeance directly, but His whole creation rises up and inflicts punishments upon the impious; and although in the present world the goodness of God bestows the light of the world and the services of the earth alike upon the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and the impious, yet not without grief does the sun afford his light, and the other elements perform their service, to the impious. And, in short, sometimes even in opposition to the goodness of the Creator, the elements are wearied out by the crimes of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; and thence it is that either the fruit of the earth is blighted, or the composition of the air is vitiated, or the heat of the sun is increased beyond measure, or there is an excessive amount of rain or of cold. Thence pestilence, and famine, and death in various forms stalk forth, for the creature hastens to take vengeance on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; yet the goodness of God restrains it, and bridles its indignation against the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and compels it to be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to His mercy, rather than to be inflamed by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and the crimes of men. For the patience of God waits for the conversion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as long as they are in this body.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28. Eternity of Punishments.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But if any persist in impiety till the end of life, then as soon as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, departs, it shall pay the penalty of its persistence in impiety. For even the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the impious are <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, though perhaps they themselves would wish them to end with their bodies. But it is not so; for they endure without end the torments of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, and to their destruction they have not the quality of mortality. But perhaps you will say to me, You terrify us, O Peter. And how shall we speak to you the things which are in reality? Can we declare to you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by keeping silence? We cannot state the things which are, otherwise than as they are. But if we were silent, we should make ourselves the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that is ruinous to you, and should satisfy the serpent that lurks within you, and blocks up your senses, who cunningly suggests these things to you, that he may make you always the enemies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But we are sent for this end, that we may betray his disguises to you; and melting your enmities, may reconcile you to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may be converted to Him, and may please Him by good works. For man is at enmity with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is in an unreasonable and impious state of mind and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> disposition towards Him, especially when he thinks that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> something, and is in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. But when you lay aside these, and begin to be pleased and displeased with the same things which please and displease <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to will what God wills then you shall <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> be called His friends.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29. God's Care of Human Things.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But perhaps some of you will say, God has no care of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things; and if we cannot even attain to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him, how shall we attain to His friendship? That God does concern Himself with the affairs of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, His government of the world bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>: for the sun daily waits upon it, the showers minister to it; the fountains, rivers, winds, and all elements, attend upon it; and the more these things become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the more do they indicate God's care over men. For unless by the power of the Most High, the more powerful would never minister to the inferior; and by this God is shown to have not only a care over men, but some great affection, since He has deputed such noble elements to their service. But that men may also attain to the friendship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to us by the example of those to whose <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> He has been so favourable, that He has withheld the heaven from rain when they wished, and has again opened it when they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>.  And many other things He has bestowed upon those who does His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, which could not be bestowed but upon His friends. But you will say, What harm is done to God if these things also are worshipped by us? If any one of you should pay to another the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> that is due to his father, from whom he has received innumerable benefits, and should reverence a stranger and foreigner as his father, should you not think that he was undutiful towards his father, and most deserving to be disinherited?</p>

<h2>Chapter 30. Religion of Fathers to Be Abandoned.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Others say, It is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> if we do not worship those <em><a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a></em> which have come down to us from our fathers, and prove false to the religion bequeathed to us by our ancestors. On this principle, if any one's father was a robber or a base fellow, he ought not to change the manner of life handed down to him by his fathers, nor to be recalled from his father's <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> to a better way; and it is reckoned impious if one do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, or does not persist in impiety with them. Others say, We ought not to be troublesome to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to be always burdening Him with complaints of our miseries, or with the exigencies of our petitions. How foolish and witless an answer! Do you think it is troublesome to God if you thank Him for His benefits, while you do not think it troublesome to Him if, for His gifts, you render thanks to stocks and stones? And how comes it, that when rain is withheld in a long drought, we all turn our eyes to heaven, and entreat the gift of rain from God Almighty, and all of us with our little ones pour out <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> on God and entreat His compassion? But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> ungrateful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, when they obtain the blessing, quickly forget: for as soon as they have gathered in their harvest or their vintage, straightway they offer the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> to deaf and dumb images, and pay vows in temples or groves for those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has bestowed upon them, and then offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; and having received a favour, deny the bestower of the favour. </p>

<h2>Chapter 31. Paganism, Its Enormities.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But some say, These things are instituted for the sake of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and for refreshing our minds; and they have been devised for this end, that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind may be relaxed for a little from cares and sorrows. See now what a charge you yourselves bring upon the things which you practise. If these things have been invented for the purpose of lightening sorrow and affording enjoyment, how is it that the invocations of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are performed in groves and woods? What is the meaning of the insane whirlings, and the slashing of limbs, and the cutting off of members? How is it that mad rage is produced in them? How is insanity produced? How is it that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are driven violently, raging with dishevelled hair? Whence the shrieking and gnashing of teeth? Whence the bellowing of the heart and the bowels, and all those things which, whether they are pretended or are contrived by the ministration of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, are exhibited to the terror of the foolish and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>? Are these things done for the sake of lightening the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or rather for the sake of oppressing it? Do ye not yet perceive nor understand, that these are the counsels of the serpent lurking within you, which draws you away from the apprehension of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by irrational suggestions of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, that he may hold you as slaves and servants of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and concupiscence and every disgraceful thing?</p>

<h2>Chapter 32. True Religion Calls to Sobriety and Modesty.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But I protest to you with the clear voice of preaching, that, on the contrary, the religion of God calls you to sobriety and modesty; orders you to refrain from effeminacy and <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, and by patience and gentleness to prevent the inroads of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; to be content with your own possessions, and with the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of frugality; not even when driven by poverty to plunder the goods of others, but in all things to observe <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; to withdraw yourselves wholly from the idol <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>: for by these things you invite <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> to you, and of your own accord give them the power of entering into you; and so you admit that which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> either of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> or of unlawful <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33. Origin of Impiety.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Hence is the origin of all impiety; hence murders, adulteries, thefts; and a nursery is formed of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> and wickednesses, while you indulge in profane libations and odours, and give to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits an opportunity of ruling and obtaining some sort of authority over you. For when they invade your senses, what do they else than work the things which belong to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and cruelty, and compel you to be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to all things that are pleasing to them? <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, indeed, permits you to suffer this at their hands by a certain righteous judgment, that from the very disgrace of your doings and your feelings you may understand how unworthy it is to be subject to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence also, by the friendship of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, men are brought to disgraceful and base <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; hence, men proceed even to the destruction of life, either through the fire of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, or through the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> through excess of grief, so that, as is well  <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, some have even laid violent hands upon themselves. And this, as we have said, by a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> sentence of God they are not prevented from doing, that they may both understand to whom they have yielded themselves in subjection, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whom they have forsaken.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34. Who are Worshippers of God?</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But some one will say, These <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> sometimes befall even those who worship God. It is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For we say, that he is a worshipper of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and observes the precepts of His law. For in God's estimation he is not a Jew who is called a Jew among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> (nor is he a Gentile that is called a Gentile), but he who, believing in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, fulfils His law and does His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, though he be not <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>.  He is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worshipper of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who not only is himself free from <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but also sets others free from them; though they be so heavy that they are like mountains, he removes them by means of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with which he believes in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yea, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> removes mountains with their trees, if it be necessary.  But he who seems to worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but is neither fortified by a full <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nor by <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the commandments, but is a sinner, has given a place in himself, by reason of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, to <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, which are appointed of God for the punishment of those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that they may exact from them the deserts of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by means of punishments inflicted, and may bring them purified to the general judgment of all, provided always that their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> do not fail them in their chastisement. For the chastisement of unbelievers in the present life is a judgment, by which they begin to be separated from future blessings; but the chastisement of those who worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while it is inflicted upon them for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> into which they have fallen, exacts from them the due of what they have done, that, preventing the judgment, they may pay the debt of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the present life, and be freed, at least in half, from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishments which are there prepared.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35. Judgment to Come.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But he does not receive these things as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> who does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is to be a judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore, being bound by the pleasures of the present life, is shut out from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; and therefore we do not neglect to proclaim to you what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be necessary for your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and to show you what is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that, believing in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you may be able, by means of good works, to be heirs with us of the world to come. But if you are not yet convinced that what we say is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, meantime, in the first instance, you ought not to take it amiss and to be hostile to us because we announce to you the things which we consider to be good, and because we do not grudge to bestow also upon you that which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> brings <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to ourselves, labouring, as I have said, with all eagerness, that we may have you as fellow-heirs of the blessings which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> are to befall ourselves. But whether those things which we declare to you are certainly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, you shall not be able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> otherwise than by rendering <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the things which are commanded, that you may be taught by the issue of things, and the most certain end of blessedness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36. Conclusion of Discourse.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>And, therefore, although the serpent lurking within you occupies your senses with a thousand arts of corruption, and throws in your way a thousand obstacles, by which he may turn you away from the hearing of saving instruction, all the more ought you to resist him, and despising his suggestions, to come together the more frequently to hear the word and receive instruction from us, because nobody can learn anything who is not taught.</q></span> </p>

<p>And when he had done speaking, he ordered those to be brought to him who were oppressed by sickness or <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and laid his hands upon them with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; and so he dismissed the crowds, charging them to resort to the hearing of the word during the days that he was to remain there. Therefore, when the crowds had departed, Peter washed his body in the waters which ran through the garden, with as many of the others as chose to do so; and then ordered the couches to be spread on the ground under a very shady tree, and directed us to recline according to the order established at C&aelig;sarea. And thus, having taken food and given thanks to God after the manner of the Hebrews, as there was yet some portion of the day remaining, he ordered us to question him on any matters that we pleased. And although we were with him twenty in all, he explained to every one whatever he pleased to ask of him; the particulars of which I set down in books and sent to you some time ago. And when evening came we entered with him into the lodging, and went to sleep, each one in his own place.</p>
