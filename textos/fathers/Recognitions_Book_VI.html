<h1>Recognitions (Book VI)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. Book VI. Diligence in Study.</h2>

<p>But as soon as day began to advance the dawn upon the retiring darkness, Peter having gone into the garden to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and returning thence and coming to us, by way of excuse for awaking and coming to us a little later than usual, said this:  <span class="quote2"><q>Now that the spring-time has lengthened the day, of course the night is shorter; if, therefore, one desires to occupy some portion of the night in study, he must not keep the same hours  for waking at all seasons, but should spend the same length of time in sleeping, whether the night be longer or shorter, and be exceedingly careful that he do not cut off from the period which he is wont to have for study, and so add to his sleep and lessen his time of keeping awake. And this also is to be observed, lest haply if sleep be interrupted while the food is still undigested, the undigested mass lead the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and by the exhalation of crude spirits render the inner sense confused and disturbed. It is right, therefore, that that part also be cherished with sufficient rest, so that, those things being sufficiently accomplished which are due to it, the body may be able in other things to render due service to the mind.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Much to Be Done in a Little Time.</h2>

<p>When he had said this, as very many had already assembled in the accustomed place of the garden to hear him, Peter went forth; and having saluted the crowds in his usual manner, began to speak as follows:  <!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Since, indeed, as land neglected by the cultivator necessarily produces thorns and thistles, so your sense, by long neglect, has produced a plentiful crop of noxious opinions of things and <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of false science; there is need now of much care in cultivating the field of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and diligent husbandman of the heart, may cultivate it with continual instructions. It is therefore your part to render <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to it, and to lop off superfluous occupations and anxieties, lest a noxious growth choke the good seed of the word. For it may be that a short and earnest diligence may repair a long time's neglect; for the time of every one's life is uncertain, and therefore we must hasten to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, lest haply sudden death seize upon him who delays.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Righteous Anger.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->And all the more eagerly must we strive on this account, that while there is time, the collected <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> custom may be cut off. And this you shall not be able to do otherwise, than by being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with yourselves on account of your profitless and base doings. For this is righteous and necessary <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, by which every one is indignant with himself, and accuses himself for those things in which he has erred and done amiss; and by this indignation a certain fire is kindled in us, which, applied as it were to a barren field, consumes and burns up the roots of vile pleasure, and renders the soil of the heart more fertile for the good seed of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And I think that you have sufficiently worthy causes of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, from which that most righteous fire may be kindled, if you consider into what <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> has drawn you, and how it has caused you to fall and rush headlong into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, from what <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things it has withdrawn you, and into what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> it has driven you, and, what is of more importance than all the rest, how it has made you liable to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishments in the world to come. Is not the fire of most righteous indignation kindled within you for all these things, now that the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has shone upon you; and does not the flame of that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> which is pleasing to God rise within you, that every sprout may be burnt up and destroyed from the root, if haply any shoot of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> concupiscence has budded within you?</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Not Peace, But a Sword.</h2>

<p>Hence, also, He who has sent us, when He had come,  and had seen that all the world had fallen into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, did not immediately give peace to him who is in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, lest He should confirm him in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but set the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in opposition to the ruins of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of it, that, if haply men would repent and look upon the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they might rightly grieve that they had been deceived and drawn away into the precipices of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and might kindle the fire of salutary <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that had deceived them. On this account, therefore, He said, 'I have come to send fire on the earth; and how I wish that it were kindled!' <span class="stiki" id="note080778"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;12:49</a></span> There is therefore a certain fight, which is to be fought by us in this life; for the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> necessarily separates men from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, as we have often seen putrified and dead flesh in the body separated by the cutting knife from its connection with the living members. Such is the effect produced by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For it is necessary that, for the sake of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, the son, for example, who has received the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, be separated from his unbelieving <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; or again, that the father be separated from his son, or the daughter from her mother. And in this manner the battle of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, arises between believing and unbelieving kinsmen and relations. And therefore He who has sent us said again, 'I am not come to send peace on earth, but a sword.' <span class="stiki" id="note080779"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;10:34</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 5. How the Fight Begins.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But if any one say, How does it seem right for men to be separated from their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>? I will tell you how. Because, if they remained with them in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, they would do no good to them, and they would themselves perish with them. It is therefore right, and very right, that he who will be saved be separated from him who will not. But observe this also, that this separation   does not come from those who understand aright; for they wish to be with their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>, and to do them good, and to teach them better things. But it is the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> peculiar to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, that it will not bear to have near it the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which confutes it; and therefore that separation originates with them. For those who receive the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because it is full of goodness, desire, if it be possible, to share it with all, as given by the good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; yea, even with those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> them: for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore, in short, the Master Himself, when He was being led to the cross by those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> the Father for His murderers, and said, 'Father, forgive their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do!' <span class="stiki" id="note080780"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;23:34</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> also, in imitation of the Master, even when themselves were suffering, in like manner <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for their murderers. <span class="stiki" id="note080781"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse60">Acts&nbsp;7:60</a></span> But if we are taught to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> even for our murderers and persecutors, how ought we not to bear the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and relations, and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for their conversion?</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. God to Be Loved More Than Parents.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Then let us consider carefully, in the next place, what reason we have for loving our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it is said, we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them, because they seem to be the authors of our life. But our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> are not authors of our life, but means of it. For they do not bestow life, but afford the means of our entering into this life; while the one and sole author of life is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If, therefore we would <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Author of our life, let us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is He that is to be loved. But then it is said, We cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him; but them we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and hold in affection. Be it so: you cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <em>what</em> God is, but you can very easily <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what God is <em>not</em>. For how can any man fail to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that wood, or stone, or brass, or other such matter, is not God? But if you will not give your mind to consider the things which you might easily apprehend, it is certain that you are hindered in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not by impossibility, but by indolence; for if you had wished it, even from these useless images you might have been set on the way of understanding.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The Earth Made for Men.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->For it is certain that these images are made with iron tools; but iron is wrought by fire, which fire is extinguished by water. But water is moved by spirit; and spirit has its beginning from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For thus says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: 'In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth. But the earth was invisible, and unarranged; and darkness was over the deep: and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> was upon the waters.' <span class="stiki" id="note080782"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;1:1-2</a></span> Which Spirit, like the Creator's hand, by command of God separated light from darkness; and after that invisible heaven produced this visible one, that He might make the higher places a habitation for <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and the lower for men. For your sake, therefore, by command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the water which was upon the face of the earth withdrew, that the earth might produce fruits for you; and into the earth also He inserted veins of moisture, that fountains and rivers might flow forth from it for you. For your sake it was commanded to bring forth living creatures, and all things which could serve for your use and pleasure. Is it not for you that the winds blow, that the earth, conceiving by them, may bring forth fruits? Is it not for you that the showers fall, and the seasons change? Is it not for you that the sun rises and sets, and the moon undergoes her changes? For you the sea offers its service, that all things may be subject to you, ungrateful as you are. For all these things shall there not be a righteous punishment of vengeance, because beyond all else you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the bestower of all these things, whom you ought to acknowledge and reverence above all?</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Necessity of Baptism.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But now I lead you to understanding by the same paths. For you see that all things are produced from waters. But water was made at first by the Only-begotten; and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> is the head of the Only-begotten, by whom we come to the Father in such order as we have stated above. But when you have come to the Father you will learn that this is His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, that you be born anew by means of waters, which were first created.  For he who is regenerated by water, having filled up the measure of good works, is made heir of Him by whom he has been regenerated in incorruption. Wherefore, with prepared minds, approach as sons to a father, that your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be washed away, and it may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> before God that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> was their sole <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For if, after the learning of these things, you remain in unbelief, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of your destruction will be imputed to yourselves, and not to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. And do you suppose that you can have hope towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even if you cultivate all <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and all righteousness, but do not receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Yea rather, he will be worthy or greater punishment, who does good works not well; for merit accrues to men from good works, but only if they be done as God commands. Now God has ordered every one who worships Him to be sealed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; but if you refuse, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> your own will rather than God's, you are doubtless contrary and hostile to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Use of Baptism.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But you will perhaps say, What does the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of water contribute towards the worship of God? In the first place, because that which has pleased God is fulfilled. In the second place, because, when you are regenerated and born again of water and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the frailty of your former birth, which you have through men, is cut off, and so at length you shall be able to attain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; but otherwise it is impossible. For thus has the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> testified to us with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>: 'Verily I say to you, That unless a man is born again of water, he shall not enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.'  Therefore make haste; for there is in these waters a certain power of mercy which was borne upon them at the beginning, and acknowledges those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> under the name of the threefold sacrament, and rescues them from future punishments, presenting as a gift to God the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Betake yourselves therefore to these waters, for they alone can quench the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the future fire; and he who delays to approach to them, it is evident that the idol of unbelief remains in him, and by it he is prevented from hastening to the waters which confer <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For whether you be righteous or unrighteous, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is necessary for you in every respect: for the righteous, that perfection may be accomplished in him, and he may be born again to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for the unrighteous, that pardon may be vouchsafed him of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he has committed in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Therefore all should hasten to be born again to God without delay, because the end of every one's life is uncertain.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Necessity of Good Works.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But when you have been regenerated by water, show by good works the likeness in you of that Father who has begotten you. Now you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> Him as a father; and His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is, that you live according to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. And His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is, that you so live as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, to flee from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, to put away <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and boasting, to abhor <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and to count all such things entirely unsuitable to you. There is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a certain peculiar observance of our religion, which is not so much imposed upon men, as it is sought out by every worshipper of God by reason of its purity. By reason of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, I say, of which there are many kinds, but first, that every one be careful that he 'come not near a menstruous <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>;' for this the law of God regards as detestable. But though the law had given no admonition concerning these things, should we willingly, like beetles, roll ourselves in filth? For we ought to have something more than the animals, as reasonable men, and capable of heavenly senses, whose chief study it ought to be to guard the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> from every defilement of the heart.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Inward and Outward Cleansing.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->Moreover, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and tends to purity, also to wash the body with water. I call it good, not as if it were that prime good of the purifying of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but because this of the washing of the body is the sequel of that good. For so also our Master rebuked some of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, who seemed to be better than others, and separated from the people, calling them hypocrites, because they purified only those things which were seen of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but left defiled and sordid their hearts, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone sees. To some therefore of them&mdash; not to all&mdash; He said, 'Woe to you, <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, hypocrites! Because ye cleanse the outside of the cup and platter, but the inside is full of pollution. O blind <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, first make clean what is within, and what is without shall be clean also.' <span class="stiki" id="note080785"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;23:25-26</a></span> For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, if the mind be purified by the light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, when once it is clean and clear, then it necessarily takes care of that which is without a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that is, his flesh, that it also may be purified. But when that which is without, the cleansing of the flesh, is neglected, it is certain that there is no care taken of the purity of the mind and the cleanness of the heart. Thus therefore it comes to pass, that he who is clean inwardly is without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> cleansed outwardly also, but not always that he who is clean outwardly is also cleansed inwardly&mdash; to wit, when he does these things that he may please men.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Importance of Chastity.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But this kind of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is also to be observed, that sexual intercourse must not take place heedlessly and for the sake of mere pleasure, but for the sake of begetting children.  And since this observance is found even among some of the lower animals, it were a shame if it be not observed by men, reasonable, and worshipping God. But there is this further reason why <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> should be observed by those who hold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in those forms of it of which we have spoken, and others of like sort, that it is observed strictly even among those who are still held by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, for even among them there is in some degree the observance of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. What then? Will you not observe, now that you are reformed, what you observed when you were in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Superiority of Christian Morality.</h2>

<p><!--<span class="quote2"><q>-->But perhaps some one of you will say, Must we then observe all things which we did while we worshipped <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>? Not all. But whatever things were done well, these you ought to observe even now; because, if anything is rightly done by those who are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, it is certain that that is derived from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; whereas, if anything is not rightly done in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, that is, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, borrowed from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For good is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, though it be done by those who are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, though it be done by those who follow the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Or shall we be so foolish, that if we see a worshipper of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> to be sober, we shall refuse to be sober, lest we should seem to do the same things which he does who worships <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>? It is not so. But let this be our study, that if those who <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> do not commit <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, we should not even be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>; if they do not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, we should not even <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> another's wife; if they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their neighbours, we should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> even our enemies; if they lend to those who have the means of paying, we should give to those from whom we do not hope to receive anything. And in all things, we who hope for the inheritance of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> world ought to excel those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> only the present world; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that if their works, when compared with our works, be found like and equal in the day of judgment, there will be confusion to us, because we are found equal in our works to those who are condemned on account of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and had no hope of the world to come.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Knowledge Enhances Responsibility.</h2>

<p><span class="quote2"><q>And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> confusion is our worthy portion, if we have done no more than those who are inferior to us in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But if it be confusion to us, to be found equal to them in works, what shall become of us if the examination that is to take place find us inferior and worse than them? Hear, therefore, how our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Prophet has taught us concerning these things; for, with respect to those who neglect to hear the words of wisdom, He speaks thus: 'The queen of the south shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here, and they hear Him not.'  But with respect to those who refused to repent of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>, He spoke thus: 'The men of Nineve shall rise in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.'  You see, therefore, how He condemned those who were instructed out of the law, by adducing the example of those who came from Gentile <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and showing that the former were not even equal to those who seemed to live in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. From all these things, then, the statement that He propounded is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, that <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, which is observed to a certain extent even by those who live in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, should be held much more purely and strictly, in all its forms, as we showed above, by us who follow the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and the rather because with us <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rewards are assigned to its observance.</q></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, and Widows Ordained at Tripolis.</h2>

<p>When he had said these things, and others to the same effect, he dismissed the crowds; and having, according to his custom, supped with his friends, he went to sleep. And while in this manner he was teaching the word of God for three whole months, and converting multitudes to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, at the last he ordered me to fast; and after the fast he conferred on me the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of ever-flowing water, in the fountains which adjoin the sea.  And when, for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of regeneration divinely conferred upon me, we had joyfully kept holiday with our brethren, Peter ordered those who had been appointed to go before him, to proceed to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and there to wait three months more. And they having gone, he himself led down to the fountains, which, I have said, are near the sea, those who had fully received the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Lord, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> them; and celebrating  the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> with them, he appointed, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> over them, Maro, who had entertained him in his house, and who was now perfect in all things; and with him he ordained twelve <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> at the same time. He also instituted the order of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and arranged all the services of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and charged them all to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Maro their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in all things that he should command them. And thus all things being suitably arranged, when the three months were fulfilled, we bade farewell to those who were at Tripolis, and set out for <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</p>
