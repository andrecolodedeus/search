<h1>Refutation of All Heresies (Book IX)</h1>

<h2>Contents.</h2>

<p>The following are the contents of the ninth book of the <em>Refutation of all Heresies</em>:&mdash; </p>

<p>What the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> folly is of Noetus, and that he devoted himself to the tenets of Heraclitus the Obscure, not to those of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>And how Callistus, intermingling the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Cleomenes, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Noetus, with that of Theodotus, constructed another more novel <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and what sort the life of this (<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>) was.</p>

<p>What was the recent  arrival (at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>) of the strange spirit Elchasai, and that there served as a concealment of his peculiar <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> his apparent adhesion to the law, when in point of fact he devotes himself to the tenets of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, or even of the astrologists, and to the arts of sorcery.</p>

<p>What the customs of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are, and how many diversities of opinion there are (among them).</p>

<h2>Chapter 1. An Account of Contemporaneous Heresy.</h2> 

<p>A lengthened conflict, then, having been maintained concerning all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> by us who, at all events, have not left any unrefuted, the greatest struggle now remains behind, viz., to furnish an account and refutation of those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> that have sprung up in our own day, by which certain <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and presumptuous men have attempted to scatter abroad the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and have introduced the greatest confusion  among all the faithful throughout the entire world. For it seems expedient that we, making an onslaught upon the opinion which constitutes the prime source of (contemporaneous) <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, should prove what are the originating principles  of this (opinion), in order that its offshoots, becoming a matter of general notoriety, may be made the object of universal scorn.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Source of the Heresy of Noetus; Cleomenes His Disciple; Its Appearance at Rome During the Episcopates of Zephyrinus and Callistus; Noetianism Opposed at Rome by Hippolytus.</h2>

<p>There has appeared one, Noetus  by name, and by birth a native of Smyrna. This person introduced a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> from the tenets of Heraclitus.  Now a certain man called Epigonus becomes his minister and pupil, and this person during his sojourn at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> disseminated his godless opinion. But Cleomenes, who had become his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, an alien both in way of life and habits from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was wont to corroborate the (Noetian) doctrine. At that time, Zephyrinus imagines that he administers the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>  &mdash; an uninformed and shamefully corrupt man. And he, being persuaded by proffered gain, was accustomed to connive at those who were present for the purpose of becoming <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Cleomenes. But (Zephyrinus) himself, being in process of time enticed away, hurried headlong  into the same opinions; and he had Callistus as his adviser, and a fellow-champion of these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> tenets.  But the life of this (Callistus), and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> invented by him, I shall after a little explain. The school of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> during the succession <em>of such <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a></em>, continued to acquire strength and augmentation, from the fact that Zephyrinus and Callistus helped them to prevail.  Never at any time, however, have we been guilty of collusion with them; but we have frequently offered them opposition,  and have refuted them, and have forced them reluctantly to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And they, abashed and constrained by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, have confessed <em>their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a></em> for a short period, but after a little, wallow once again in the same mire. </p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Noetianism an Offshoot from the Heraclitic Philosophy.</h2>

<p>But since we have exhibited the succession of their genealogy, it seems expedient next that we should also explain the depraved teaching involved in their doctrines. <em>For this purpose</em> we shall first adduce the opinions advanced by Heraclitus <q>the Obscure,</q>  and we shall next make manifest what are the portions of these opinions that are of Heraclitean origin. <em>Such parts of their system</em> its present champions are not aware belong to the <q>Obscure</q> <em><a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a></em>, but they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>  them to belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But if they might happen to fall in with the following observations, perhaps they thus might be put out of countenance, and induced to desist from this godless <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of theirs. Now, even though the opinion of Heraclitus has been expounded by us previously in the <em>Philosophumena</em>, it nevertheless seems expedient now also to set down side by side in contrast the <em>two systems</em>, in order that by this closer refutation they may be evidently instructed. <em>I mean</em> the followers of this (<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>), who <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>  themselves to be <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when in reality they are not so, but of <q>the Obscure.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 4. An Account of the System of Heraclitus.</h2>

<p>Heraclitus then says that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is <em>one</em>,  divisible and indivisible; generated <em>and</em> ungenerated; mortal <em>and</em> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; reason, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, God.  <q>For those who hearken not to me, but the doctrine, it is wise that they acknowledge all things to be one,</q> says Heraclitus; and because all do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> or confess this, he utters a reproof somewhat in the following terms: <q>People do not understand how what is diverse (nevertheless) coincides with itself, just like the inverse harmony of a bow and lyre.</q>  But that Reason always exists, inasmuch as it constitutes the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and as it pervades all things, he affirms in this manner. <q>But in regard of this Reason, which always exists, men are continually devoid of understanding,  both before they have heard of it and in first gearing of it. For though all things take place according to this Reason, they seem like <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> devoid of any experience regarding it. Still they attempt both words and works of such a description as I am giving an account of, by making a division according to nature, and declaring how things are.</q> And that a Son is the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> and throughout endless ages an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> king of all things, he thus asserts: <q>A sporting child, playing at his dice, is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; the kingdom is that of a child.</q>  And that the Father of all things that have been generated is an unbegotten creature who is creator, let us hear <em>Heraclitus</em> affirming in these words: <q>Contrariety is a progenitor of all things, and king of all; and it exhibited some as gods, but others as men, and made some slaves, whereas others free.</q> And (he likewise affirms) that there is a harmony, as in a bow and lyre. That obscure harmony (is better),  though unknown and invisible to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, he asserts in these words: <q>An obscure harmony is preferable to an obvious one.</q> He commends and admires before what is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, that which is unknown and invisible <em>in regard</em> of its power. And that <em>harmony</em> visible to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and not incapable of being discovered, is better, he asserts in these words: <q>Whatever things are objects of vision, hearing, <em>and</em> intelligence, these I pre-eminently <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>,</q> he says; that is, <em>he prefers</em> things visible to those that are invisible. From such expressions of his it is easy to understand <em>the spirit of his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a></em>. <q>Men,</q> he says, <q>are deceived in reference to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of manifest things similarly with Homer, who was wiser than all the Greeks. For even children  killing vermin deceived him, when they said, 'What we have seen and seized, these we leave behind; whereas what we neither have seen nor seized, these we carry away.'</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Heraclitus' Estimate of Hesiod; Paradoxes of Heraclitus; His Eschatology; The Heresy of Noetus of Heraclitean Origin; Noetus' View of the Birth and Passion of Our Lord.</h2>

<p>In this manner Heraclitus assigns to the visible an equality of position and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> with the invisible, as if what was visible and what was invisible were confessedly some one thing. For he says, <q>An obscure harmony is preferable to an obvious one; </q>and, <q>Whatsoever things are objects of vision, hearing, <em>and</em> intelligence,</q> that is, of the (corporeal) organs&mdash;<q>these,</q> he says, <q>I pre-eminently <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>,</q> not (on this occasion, though previously), having pre-eminently honoured invisible things. Therefore neither darkness, nor light, nor <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, nor good, Heraclitus affirms, is different, but one and the same thing. At all events, he censures Hesiod  because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <em>not</em> day and night. For day, he says, and night are one, expressing himself somehow thus: <q>The teacher, however, of a vast amount of information is Hesiod, and people suppose this <em>poet</em> to be possessed of an exceedingly large store of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and yet he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> (the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of) day and night, for they are one.</q> As regards both what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and what is bad, (they are, according to Heraclitus, likewise) one. <q>Physicians, undoubtedly,</q> says Heraclitus, <q>when they make incisions and cauterize, <em>though</em> in every respect they wickedly torture the sick, complain that they do not receive fitting remuneration from their patients, notwithstanding that they perform these salutary operations upon diseases.</q> And both straight and twisted are, he says, the same. <q>The way is straight and curved of the carders of wool; </q>  and the circular movement of an instrument in the fuller's shop called <q>a screw</q> is straight and curved, for it revolves up and circularly at the same time. <q>One and the same,</q> he says, <q> <em>are, therefore, straight and curved</em>.</q> And upward and downward,  he says, are one and the same. <q>The way up <em>and the way</em> down are the same.</q> And he says that what is filthy and what is pure are one and the same, and what is drinkable and unfit for drink are one and the same. <q>Sea,</q> he says, <q>is water very pure and very foul, drinkable to fishes no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and salutary <em>for them</em>, but not fit to be used as drink by men, and (for them) pernicious.</q> And, confessedly, he asserts that what is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> is mortal,  and that what is mortal is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, in the following expressions: <q>Immortals are mortal, <em>and</em> mortals are <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, <em>that is</em>, when the one derive life from death, and the other death from life.</q> And he affirms also that there is a resurrection of this palpable flesh in which we have been born; and he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> God to be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this resurrection, expressing himself in this manner: <q>Those that are here  <em>will God enable</em> to arise and become guardians of quick and dead.</q> And he likewise affirms that a judgment of the world and all things in it takes place by fire, expressing himself thus: <q>Now, thunder pilots all things,</q> that is, directs <em>them</em>, meaning by the thunder <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>. But he also asserts that this fire is endued with intelligence, and a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the management of the Universe, and he denominates it craving and satiety. Now craving is, according to him, the arrangement <em>of the world</em>, whereas satiety its destruction. <q>For,</q> says he, <q>the fire, coming upon <em>the earth</em>, will judge and seize all things.</q></p>

<p>But in this chapter <em>Heraclitus</em> simultaneously explains the entire peculiarity of his mode of thinking, but at the same time the (characteristic quality) of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Noetus. And I have briefly demonstrated <em>Noetus</em> to be not a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but of Heraclitus. For <em>this <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a></em> asserts that the primal world is itself the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a> and creator of itself in the following passage: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is day, night; winter, summer; <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, peace; surfeit, famine.</q> All things are contraries&mdash; this appears his meaning&mdash; but an alteration takes place, just as  if <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> were mixed with <em>other sorts of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a></em>, but denominated  according to the pleasurable sensation produced by each <em>sort</em>. Now it is evident to all that the silly successors of Noetus, and the champions of his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, even though they have not been hearers of the discourses of Heraclitus, nevertheless, at any rate when they adopt the opinions of Noetus, undisguisedly acknowledge these (Heraclitean) tenets. For they advance statements after this manner&mdash; that one and the same God is the Creator and Father of all things; and that when it pleased Him, He <em>nevertheless</em> appeared, (though invisible,) to just men of old. For when He is not seen He is invisible; <em>and He is</em> incomprehensible when He does not wish to be comprehended, but comprehensible when he is comprehended. Wherefore it is that, according to the same account, He is invincible and vincible, unbegotten and begotten, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and mortal. How shall not <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> holding this description of opinions be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Heraclitus? Did not (Heraclitus) the Obscure anticipate <em>Noetus</em> in framing a system of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, according to identical modes of expression?</p>

<p>Now, that <em>Noetus</em> affirms that the Son and Father are the same, no one is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. But he makes his statement thus: <q>When indeed, then, the Father had not been born, He <em>yet</em> was <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> styled Father; and when it pleased Him to undergo generation, having been begotten, He Himself became His own Son, not another's.</q> For in this manner he thinks to establish the sovereignty <em>of God</em>, alleging that Father and Son, so called, are one and the same (substance), not one individual produced from a different one, but Himself from Himself; and that He is styled by name Father and Son, according to vicissitude of times.  But that He is one who has appeared (among us), both having submitted to generation from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and as a man having held converse among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And, on account of the birth that had taken place, He confessed Himself to those beholding Him a Son, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>; yet He made no secret to those who could comprehend Him of His being a Father. That this person suffered by being fastened to the tree, and that He commended His spirit unto Himself, having died <em>to appearance</em>, and not being (in reality) dead. And He raised Himself up the third day, after having been interred in a sepulchre, and wounded with a spear, and perforated with nails.Cleomenes asserts, in common with his hand <em>of followers</em>, that this person is God and Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, <em>and thus</em> introduces among many an obscurity (of thought) such as we find in the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of Heraclitus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Conduct of Callistus and Zephyrinus in the Matter of Noetianism; Avowed Opinion of Zephyrinus Concerning Jesus Christ; Disapproval of Hippolytus; As a Contemporaneous Event, Hippolytus Competent to Explain It.</h2>

<p>Callistus attempted to confirm this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>&mdash;a man cunning in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and subtle where deceit was concerned, (and) who was impelled by restless ambition to mount the episcopal throne.  <em>Now this man moulded to his purpose</em> Zephyrinus, an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and illiterate individual, and one unskilled in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> definitions.  And inasmuch as <em>Zephyrinus</em> was accessible to <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, <em>Callistus</em>, by luring him through presents, and by illicit demands, was enabled to seduce him into whatever course of action he pleased. And so it was that Callistus succeeded in inducing Zephyrinus to create continually disturbances among the brethren, while he himself took care subsequently, by knavish words, to attach both factions in good-will to himself. And, at one time, to those who entertained <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinions, he would in private  allege that they held similar doctrines (with himself), and thus make them his dupes; while at another time <em>he would act similarly towards</em> those (who embraced) the tenets of Sabellius. But <em>Callistus</em> perverted <em>Sabellius</em> himself, and this, too, though he had the ability of rectifying <em>this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic's</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a></em>. For (at any time) during our admonition <em>Sabellius</em> did not evince obduracy; but as long as he continued alone with Callistus, he was wrought upon to relapse into the system of Cleomenes by this very <em>Callistus</em>, who alleges that he entertains similar opinions to <em>Cleomenes</em>. <em>Sabellius</em>, however, did not then perceive the knavery <em>of Callistus</em>; but he afterwards came to be aware of it, as I shall narrate presently.</p>

<p>Now <em>Callistus</em> brought forward Zephyrinus himself, and induced him publicly to avow <em>the following sentiments</em>: <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; nor except Him <em>do I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> any</em> other that is begotten and amenable to suffering.</q> And on another occasion, when he would make the following statement: <q>The Father did not die, but the Son.</q> <em>Zephyrinus</em> would in this way continue to keep up ceaseless disturbance among the people. And we,  becoming aware of his sentiments, did not give place to him, but reproved and withstood him for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth's</a> sake. And he hurried headlong into folly, from the fact that all consented to his hypocrisy&mdash; we,  however, <em>did</em> not <em>do so</em>&mdash; and called us worshippers of two gods, disgorging, independent of compulsion,  the venom lurking within him. It would seem to us desirable to explain the life of this <em><a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a></em>, inasmuch as he was born about the same time with ourselves, in order that, by the exposure of the habits of a person of this description, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> attempted to be established by him may be easily <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and may perchance be regarded as silly, by those endued with intelligence. This <em>Callistus</em> became a <q><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a></q> at the period when Fuscianus was prefect of Rome, and the mode of his <q><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a></q> was as follows. </p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The Personal History of Callistus; His Occupation as a Banker; Fraud on Carpophorus; Callistus Absconds; Attempted Suicide; Condemned to the Treadmill; Re-Condemnation by Order of the Prefect Fuscianus; Banished to Sardinia; Release of Callistus by the Interference Of Marcion; Callistus Arrives at Rome; Pope Victor Removes Callistus to Antium; Return of Callistus on Victor's Death; Zephyrinus Friendly to Him; Callistus Accused by Sabellius; Hippolytus' Account of the Opinions of Callistus; The Callistian School at Rome, and Its Practices; This Sect in Existence in Hippolytus' Time.</h2>

<p> <em>Callistus</em> happened to be a domestic of one Carpophorus, a man of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> belonging to the household of Caesar. To this <em>Callistus</em>, as being of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, Carpophorus committed no inconsiderable amount of money, and directed him to bring in profitable returns from the banking business. And he, receiving <em>the money</em>, tried (the experiment of) a bank in what is called the <em>Piscina Publica</em>.  And in process of time were entrusted to him not a few deposits by <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and brethren, under the ostensive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <em>lodging their money with</em> Carpophorus. <em>Callistus</em>, however, made away with all (the moneys committed to him), and became involved in pecuniary difficulties. And after having practised such conduct as this, there was not wanting one to tell Carpophorus, and the latter stated that he would require an account from him. Callistus, perceiving these things, and suspecting danger from his master, escaped away by stealth, directing his flight towards the sea. And finding a vessel in Portus ready for a voyage, he went on board, intending to sail wherever she happened to be bound for. But not even in this way could he avoid detection, for there was not wanting one who conveyed to Carpophorus intelligence of what had taken place. But <em>Carpophorus</em>, in accordance with the information he had received, at once repaired to the harbour (Portus), and made an effort to hurry into the vessel <em>after Callistus</em>. The boat, however, was anchored in the middle of the harbour; and as the ferryman was slow in his movements, Callistus, who was in the ship, had time to descry his master at a distance. And <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that himself would be inevitably captured, he became reckless of life; and, considering his affairs to be in a desperate condition, he proceeded to cast himself into the sea. But the sailors leaped into boats and drew him out, unwilling to come, while those on shore were raising a loud cry. And thus <em>Callistus</em> was handed over to his master, and brought to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and his master lodged him in the <em>Pistrinum</em>. </p>

<p>But as time wore on, as happens to take place <em>in such cases</em>, brethren repaired to Carpophorus, and entreated him that he would release the fugitive serf from punishment, on the plea of their alleging that <em>Callistus</em> acknowledged himself to have money lying <em>to his credit</em> with certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. But Carpophorus, as a devout man, said he was indifferent regarding his own <em>property</em>, but that he felt a concern for the deposits; for many shed tears as they remarked to him, that they had committed what they had entrusted to Callistus, under the ostensive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <em>lodging the money with</em> himself.  And Carpophorus yielded to their persuasions, and gave directions for the liberation of <em>Callistus</em>. The latter, however, having nothing to pay, and not being able again to abscond, from the fact of his being watched, planned an artifice by which he hoped to meet death. Now, pretending that he was repairing as it were to his creditors, he hurried on their <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who were congregated, and took his stand, and created a disturbance among them. They, however, being disturbed by him, offered him insult, and inflicted blows upon him, and dragged him before Fuscianus, who was prefect of the city. And (on being asked the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of such treatment), they replied in the following terms: <q>Romans have conceded to us  the privilege of publicly reading those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of ours that have been handed down from our fathers. This person, however, by coming into (our place of worship), prevented (us so doing), by creating a disturbance among us, alleging that he is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</q> And Fuscianus happens at the time to be on the judgment-seat; and on intimating his indignation against Callistus, on account of the statements made by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, there was not wanting one to go and acquaint Carpophorus concerning these transactions. And he, hastening to the judgment-seat of the prefect, exclaimed, <q>I implore of you, my lord Fuscianus, do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this <em>fellow</em>; for he is not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but seeks occasion of death, having made away with a quantity of my money, as I shall prove.</q> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, however, supposing that this was a stratagem, as if Carpophorus were seeking under this pretext to liberate <em>Callistus</em>, with the greater enmity clamoured <em>against him</em> in presence of the prefect. <em>Fuscianus</em>, however, was swayed by these <em><a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></em>, and having scourged <em>Callistus</em>, he gave him <em>to be sent</em> to a mine in Sardinia. </p>

<p>But after a time, there being in that place other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, Marcia, a concubine of Commodus, who was a God-loving female, and desirous of performing some good work, invited into her presence  the blessed Victor, who was at that time a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,  and inquired of him what <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were in Sardinia. And he delivered to her the names of all, but did not give the <em>name</em> of Callistus, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the acts he had ventured upon. Marcia,  obtaining her request from Commodus, hands the letter of emancipation to Hyacinthus, a certain eunuch,  rather advanced in life. And he, on receiving <em>it</em>, sailed away into Sardinia, and having delivered <em>the letter</em> to the person who at that time was governor of the territory, he succeeded in having the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> released, with the exception of Callistus. But <em>Callistus</em> himself, dropping on his knees, and weeping, entreated that he likewise might obtain a release. Hyacinthus, therefore, overcome by <em>the captive's</em> importunity, requests the governor <em>to grant a release</em>, alleging that permission had been given to himself from Marcia  (to liberate Callistus), and that he would make arrangements that there should be no risk <em>in this</em> to him. Now (the governor) was persuaded, and liberated Callistus also. And when <em>the latter</em> arrived at <em>Rome</em>, Victor was very much grieved at what had taken place; but since he was a compassionate man, he took no action in the matter. Guarding, however, against the reproach (uttered) by many&mdash;for the attempts made by <em>this Callistus</em> were not distant occurrences&mdash;and because Carpophorus also still continued adverse, <em>Victor</em> sends <em>Callistus</em> to take up his abode in Antium, having settled on him a certain monthly allowance for food. And after <em>Victor's death, Zephyrinus, having had Callistus</em> as a fellow-worker in the management of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, paid him respect to his own damage; and transferring this person from Antium, appointed him over the cemetery. </p>

<p>And Callistus, who was in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of always associating with Zephyrinus, and, as I have previously stated, of paying him <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocritical</a> service, disclosed, <em>by force of contrast, Zephyrinus to be</em> a person able neither to form a judgment of things said, nor discerning the design of Callistus, who was accustomed to converse with <em>Zephyrinus</em> on topics which yielded satisfaction <em>to the latter</em>. Thus, after the death of Zephyrinus, supposing that he had obtained (the position) after which he so eagerly pursued, he <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Sabellius, as not entertaining <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> opinions. He acted thus from apprehension of me, and imagining that he could in this manner obliterate the charge <em>against him</em> among the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, as if he did not entertain strange opinions.  He was then an <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a> and knave, and in process of time hurried away many with him. And having even venom imbedded in his heart, and forming no correct opinion on any subject,  and yet withal being ashamed to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <em>this Callistus, not only</em> on account of his publicly saying in the way of reproach to us, <q>You are Ditheists,</q> but also on account of his being frequently accused by Sabellius, as one that had transgressed his first <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, devised some such <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> as the following. <em>Callistus</em> alleges that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> Himself is Son, and that Himself is Father; and that though denominated by <em>a different</em> title, yet that in reality He is one indivisible spirit. <em>And he maintains</em> that the Father is not one person and the Son another, but that they are one and the same; and that all things are full of the Divine Spirit, both those above and <em>those</em> below. <em>And he affirms</em> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which became incarnate in the virgin, is not different from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but one and the same. And <em>he adds</em>, that this is what has been declared <em>by the Saviour</em>: <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in me? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note050986"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse2">John 14:2</a></span> For that which is seen, which is man, <em>he considers</em> to be the Son; whereas the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which was contained in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, to be the Father. <q>For,</q> says (Callistus), <q>I will not profess belief in two Gods, Father and Son, but in one. For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who subsisted in <em>the Son</em> Himself, after He had taken unto Himself our flesh, raised it to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Deity, by bringing it into union with Himself, and made it one; so that Father and Son must be styled one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that this Person being one, cannot be two.</q> And in this way <em>Callistus contends</em> that the Father suffered along with the Son; for he does not wish to assert that the Father suffered, and is one Person, being careful to avoid <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the Father. (How careful he is!) senseless and knavish fellow, who improvises <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> in every direction, only that he may <em>not</em> seem to speak in violation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and is not abashed at being at one time betrayed into the tenet of Sabellius, whereas at another into the doctrine of Theodotus.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a> <em>Callistus</em>, having ventured on such opinions, established a school <em>of theology</em> in antagonism to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, adopting the foregoing system of instruction. And he first invented the device of conniving with men in regard of their indulgence in <em>sensual</em> pleasures, saying that all had their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> forgiven by himself.  For he who is in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of attending the congregation of any one else, and is called a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, should he commit any transgression; the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, they say, is not reckoned unto him, provided only he hurries off <em>and attaches himself</em> to the school of Callistus. And many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were gratified with his regulation, as being stricken in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and at the same time having been rejected by numerous <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>; while also some of them, in accordance with our condemnatory sentence, had been by us forcibly ejected from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  <em>Now such <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> as these</em> passed over to these <em>followers of Callistus</em>, and served to crowd his school. This one propounded the opinion, that, if a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was guilty of any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, if even <em>a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em> unto death,<span class="stiki" id="note050989"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse16">1 John 5:16</a></span> he ought not to be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>. About the time of this man, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, who had been twice married, and thrice married, began <em>to be allowed</em> to retain their place among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. If also, however, any one who is in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders should become married, <em>Callistus permitted</em> such a one to continue in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders as if he had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.  And in justification, he alleges that what has been spoken by the Apostle has been declared in reference to this <em>person</em>: <q>Who are you that judgest another man's servant? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note050991"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse4">Romans 14:4</a></span> But he asserted that likewise <em>the</em> <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the tares is uttered in reference to this <em>one</em>: <q>Let the tares grow along with the wheat; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note050992"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse30">Matthew 13:30</a></span> or, in other words, let those who in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <em>remain in it</em>. But also he affirmed that the ark of Noe was made for a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in which were both dogs, and wolves, and ravens, and all things clean and unclean; and so he alleges that the case should stand in like manner with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And as many <em>parts of Scripture</em> bearing on this <em>view of the subject</em> as he could collect, be so interpreted.</p>

<p>And the hearers <em>of Callistus</em> being delighted with his tenets, continue with him, <em>thus</em> mocking both themselves as well as many <em>others</em>, and crowds of these <em>dupes</em> stream together into his school. Wherefore also <em>his pupils</em> are multiplied, and they plume themselves upon <em>the</em> crowds (attending the school) for the sake of pleasures which Christ did not permit. But in contempt of Him, they place restraint on the commission of no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, alleging that they pardon those who acquiesce (in Callistus' opinions). For even also he permitted <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>, if they were unwedded,  and burned with passion at an age at all events unbecoming, or if they were not disposed to overturn their own dignity through a legal marriage, that they might have whomsoever they would choose as a bedfellow, whether a slave or free, and that <em>a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a></em>, though not legally married, might consider such <em>a companion</em> as a husband. Whence <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, reputed <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, began to resort to drugs  for producing sterility, and to gird themselves round, so to expel what was being conceived on account of their not wishing to have a child either by a slave or by any paltry fellow, for the sake of their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and excessive <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>.  Behold, into how great impiety that lawless <em>one</em> has proceeded, by inculcating <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> at the same time! And withal, after such audacious acts, they, lost to all shame, attempt to call themselves a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>!  And some, under the supposition that they will attain prosperity, concur with them. During the <em><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a></em> of this <em>one</em>, second <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was for the first time presumptuously attempted by them. These, then, (are the practices and opinions which) that most astonishing Callistus established, whose school continues, preserving its customs and tradition, not discerning with whom they ought to communicate, <em>but</em> indiscriminately offering communion to all. And from him they have derived the denomination of their <em>cognomen</em>; so that, on account of Callistus being a foremost champion of such practices, they should be called Callistians. </p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Sect of the Elchasaites; Hippolytus' Opposition to It.</h2>

<p>The doctrine of this <em>Callistus</em> having been noised abroad throughout the entire world, a cunning man, and full of desperation, one called Alcibiades, dwelling in Apamea, <em>a city</em> of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, examined carefully into this business. And considering himself a more formidable character, and more ingenious in <em>such</em> tricks, than Callistus, he repaired to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; and he brought some book, alleging that a certain just man, Elchasai,  had received this from Serae, a town of Parthia, and that he gave it to one called Sobiai. <em>And the contents of this volume</em>, he alleged, had been revealed by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> whose height was 24 <em>schoenoi</em>, which make 96 miles, and whose breadth is 4 <em>schoenoi</em>, and from shoulder to shoulder 6 <em>schoenoi</em>; and the tracks of his feet extend to the length of three and a half <em>schoenoi</em>, which are <em>equal to</em> fourteen miles, while the breadth is one <em>schoenos</em> and a half, and the height half a <em>schoenos</em>. And <em>he alleges</em> that also there is a female with him, whose measurement, he says, is according to the <em>standards</em> already mentioned. And <em>he asserts</em> that the male (<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>) is <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but that the female is called <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. By detailing these prodigies he imagines that he confounds fools, <em>while at the same time</em> he utters the following sentence: <q>that there was preached unto men a new remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the third year of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan's</a> reign.</q> And <em>Elchasai</em> determines <em>the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of</em> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and even this I shall explain. He alleges, <em>as to</em> those who have been involved in every description of lasciviousness, and filthiness, and <em>in</em> acts of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, if only any <em>of them</em> be a believer, that he determines that such a one, on being converted, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> the book, and believing <em>its contents</em>, should by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> receive remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>Elchasai, however, ventured to continue these knaveries, taking occasion from the aforesaid tenet of which Callistus stood forward as a champion. For, perceiving that many were delighted at this sort of promise, he considered that he could opportunely make the attempt <em>just alluded to</em>. And notwithstanding we offered resistance to this, and did not permit many for any length of time to become victims of the delusion.  For we carried conviction <em>to the people, when we affirmed</em> that this was <em>the</em> operation of a spurious spirit, and the invention of a heart inflated with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and that this <em>one</em> like a wolf had risen up against many wandering sheep, which Callistus, by his <em>arts of</em> deception, had scattered abroad. But since we have commenced, we shall not be silent as regards the opinions of this <em>man</em>. And, in the first place, we shall expose his life, and we shall prove that his supposed discipline is a mere pretence. And next, I shall adduce the principal heads of his assertions, in order that the reader, looking fixedly on the treatises of this (Elchasai), may be made aware what and what sort is the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which has been audaciously attempted by this man.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Elchasai Derived His System from Pythagoras; Practised Incantations.</h2>

<p>This <em>Elchasai</em> puts forward as a decoy a polity (authorized in the) Law, alleging that <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> ought to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> and live according to <em>the</em> Law, (while at the same time) he forcibly rends certain <em>fragments</em> from the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. And he asserts that Christ was born a man in the same way as common to all, and that <em>Christ</em> was not for the first time <em>on earth when</em> born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, but that both previously and that frequently again He had been born and would be born. <em>Christ</em> would thus appear and exist <em>among us from time to time</em>, undergoing alterations of birth, and having his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> transferred from body to body. <em>Now Elchasai</em> adopted that tenet of pythagoras <em>to which I have already alluded</em>. But <em>the Elchasaites</em> have reached such an altitude of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, that even they affirm themselves to be endued with a power of foretelling futurity, using as a starting-point, obviously, <em>the</em> measures and numbers of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagorean</a> art. These also devote themselves to <em>the</em> tenets of mathematicians, and astrologers, and magicians, as if they were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. And <em>they</em> resort to these, so as to confuse silly people, <em>thus led</em> to suppose that <em>the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a></em> participate in a doctrine of power. And <em>they</em> teach certain incantations and formularies for those who have been bitten by dogs, and possessed of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and seized with other diseases; and we shall not be silent respecting even such <em>practices</em> of these <em><a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a></em>. Having then sufficiently explained their principles, and the causes of their presumptuous attempts, Ishall pass on to give an account of their writings, through which my readers will become acquainted with both the trifling and godless efforts of these <em>Elchasaites</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Elchasai's Mode of Administering Baptism; Formularies.</h2>

<p>To those, then, that have been orally instructed by him, he dispenses <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in this manner, addressing to his dupes some such words as the following: <q>If, therefore, (my) children,  one shall have intercourse with any sort of animal whatsoever, or a male, or a sister, or a daughter, or has committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, or been guilty of fornication, and is desirous of obtaining remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, from the moment that he hearkens to this book let him be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> a second time in <em>the</em> name of the Great and Most High <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in <em>the</em> name of His Son, the Mighty King. And <em>by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a></em> let him be purified and cleansed, and let him <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> for himself those seven witnesses that have been described in this book&mdash; the heaven, and the water, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> spirits, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>,  and the oil, and the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, and the earth.</q> These constitute the astonishing <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of Elchasai, those ineffable and potent <em>secrets</em> which he delivers to deserving <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And with these that lawless <em>one</em> is not satisfied, but in the presence of two and three witnesses he puts the seal to his own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <em>practices</em>. Again expressing himself thus: <q>Again I say, O adulterers and adulteresses, and <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, if you are desirous of being converted, that your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be forgiven you, as soon as ever you hearken unto this book, and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> a second time along with your garments, shall peace be yours, and <em>your</em> portion with the just.</q> But since we have stated that these resort to incantations for those bitten by dogs and for other <em>mishaps</em>, we shall explain these. Now <em>Elchasai</em> uses the following formulary: <q>If a dog rabid and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a>, in which inheres a spirit of destruction, bite any man, or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, or youth, or girl, or may worry or touch <em>them</em>, in the same hour let such a one run with all their wearing apparel, and go down to a river or to a fountain wherever there is a deep spot. Let (him or her) be dipped with all their wearing apparel, and offer supplication to the Great and Most High God in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of heart, and then let him <em>thus</em> <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> the seven witnesses described in this book: 'Behold, I call to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> the heaven and the water, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> spirits, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and the oil, and the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, and the earth. I testify by these seven witnesses that no more shall I <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, nor steal, nor be guilty of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, nor be <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, nor be actuated by <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, nor be scornful, nor shall I take pleasure in any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <em><a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a></em>.' Having uttered, therefore, these words, let such a one be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the entire of his wearing apparel in <em>the</em> name of the Mighty and Most High God.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Precepts of Elchasai.</h2>

<p>But in very many other respects he talks folly, inculcating the use of these sentences also for those afflicted with consumption, and that they should be dipped in cold <em>water</em> forty times during seven days; and <em>he prescribes</em> similar treatment for those possessed of devils. Oh inimitable wisdom and incantations gorged with powers!  Who will not be astonished at such and such force of words? But since we have stated that they also bring into requisition astrological deceit, we shall prove <em>this</em> from their own formularies; for <em>Elchasai</em> speaks thus: <q>There exist <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> stars of impiety. This declaration has been now made by us, <em>O you</em> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <em>ones</em> and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: beware of the power of the days <em>of</em> the sovereignty of these <em>stars</em>, and engage not in the commencement of any undertaking during the <em>ruling</em> days of these. And <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> not man or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> during the days of the power of these <em>stars</em>, when the moon, (emerging) from among them, courses <em>the sky</em>, and travels along with them. Beware of the very day up to that on which <em>the moon</em> passes out from these <em>stars</em>, and then <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> and enter on every beginning of your works. But, moreover, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the day of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, since that day is one of those during which prevails (the power) of these <em>stars</em>. Take care, however, not to commence <em>your works</em> the third <em>day</em> from a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, since when three years <em>of the reign</em> of the emperor Trojan are again completed from the time that he subjected the Parthians to his own sway&mdash;when, <em>I say</em>, three years have been completed, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> rages between the impious <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the northern <em>constellations; and</em> on this account all kingdoms of impiety are in a state of confusion.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 12. The Heresy of the Elchasaites a Derivative One.</h2>

<p>Inasmuch as (Elchasai) considers, then, that it would be an insult to reason that these mighty and ineffable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> should be trampled under foot, or that they should be committed to many, he advises that as valuable pearls <span class="stiki" id="note051003"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew 7:6</a></span> they should be preserved, expressing himself thus: <q>Do not recite this account to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and guard carefully these precepts, because all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are not faithful, nor are all <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> straightforward.</q> <em>Books containing</em> these (tenets), however, neither the wise men of the Egyptians secreted in shrines, nor did Pythagoras, a sage of the Greeks, conceal <em>them there</em>. For if at that time Elchasai had happened to live, what necessity would there be that Pythagoras, or Thales, or Solon, or the wise <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, or even the rest of the sages of the Greeks, should become <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, when they could obtain possession of such and such wisdom from Alcibiades, as the most astonishing interpreter of that wretched Elchasai? The statements, therefore, that have been made for the purpose of attaining a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of these, would seem sufficient for those endued with sound mind. And so it is, that it has not appeared expedient to quote more of their formularies, seeing that these are very numerous and ridiculous. Since, however, we have not omitted those <em>practices</em> that have risen up in our own day, and have not been silent as regards those <em>prevalent</em> before our time, it seems proper, in order that we may pass through all <em>their systems</em>, and leave nothing untold, to state what also are the (customs) of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and what are the diversities of opinion among them, for I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that these as yet remain behind <em>for our consideration</em>. Now, when I have broken silence on these points, I shall pass on to the demonstration of the Doctrine of the Truth, in order that, after the lengthened argumentative straggle against all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, we, devoutly pressing forward towards the kingdom's crown, and believing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, may not be unsettled.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. The Jewish Sects.</h2>

<p>Originally there prevailed but one usage  among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; for one teacher was given unto them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>namely</em> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and one law by this <em>same <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a></em>. And there <em>was</em> one desert region and one Mount Sinai, for one God it was who legislated for these <em><a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></em>. But, again, after they had crossed the river Jordan, and had inherited by lot the conquered country, they in various ways rent in sunder the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, each devising <em>a different interpretation of</em> the declarations made <em>by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></em>. And in this way they raised up for themselves teachers, (and) invented doctrines of an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> nature, and they continued to advance into (sectarian) divisions. Now it is the diversity of these <em><a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></em> that I at present propose to explain. But though for even a considerable time they have been rent into very numerous <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, yet I intend to elucidate the more principal of them, while those who are of a studious turn will easily become acquainted with the rest. For there is a division among them into three sorts;  and the adherents of the first are the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, but of the second the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, while the rest are <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a>. These practise a more devotional life, being filled with mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and being temperate. And they turn away from every act of inordinate desire, being averse even to hearing <em>of</em> things of the sort. And they renounce matrimony, but they take the boys of others, and <em>thus</em> have an offspring begotten for them. And they lead <em>these adopted children</em> into an observance of their own peculiar customs, and in this way bring them up and impel them to learn the sciences. They do not, however, forbid them to marry, though themselves refraining from matrimony. Women, however, even though they may be disposed to adhere to the same course of life,  they do not admit, inasmuch as in no way whatsoever have they confidence in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. The Tenets of the Esseni.</h2>

<p>And they despise <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and do not turn away from sharing <em>their goods</em> with those that are destitute. No one among them, however, enjoys a greater amount of riches than another. For a regulation with them is, that an individual coming forward <em>to join</em> the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> must sell his possessions, and present <em>the price of them</em> to the community. And on receiving <em>the money</em>, the head <em>of the order</em> distributes it to all according to their necessities. Thus there is no one among them in distress. And they do not use oil, regarding it as a defilement to be anointed. And there are appointed overseers, who take care of all things that belong to them in common, and they all appear always in white clothing.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. The Tenets of the Esseni Continued.</h2>

<p>But there is not one <em>city</em> of them, but many of them settle in every city. And if any of the adherents of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> may be present from a strange <em>place</em>, they consider that all things are in common for him, and those whom they had not previously <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> they receive as if they belonged to their own household and kindred. And they traverse their native land, and on each occasion that they go on a journey they carry nothing except arms. And they have also in their cities a president, who expends the <em>moneys</em> collected for this <em>purpose</em> in procuring clothing and food for them. And their robe and its shape are modest. And they do not own two cloaks, or a double set of shoes; and when those that are in present use become antiquated, then they adopt others. And they neither buy nor sell anything at all; but whatever any one has he gives to him that has not, and that which one has not he receives.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. The Tenets of the Esseni Continued.</h2>

<p>And they continue in an orderly manner, and with perseverance <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> from early dawn, and they do not speak a word unless they have praised God in a hymn. And in this way they each go forth and engage in whatever employment they please; and after having worked up to the fifth hour they leave off. Then again they come together into one place, and encircle themselves with linen girdles, for the purpose of concealing their private parts. And in this manner they perform ablutions in cold water; and after being thus cleansed, they repair together into one apartment,&mdash; now no one who entertains a different opinion from themselves assembles in the house&mdash;and they proceed to partake of breakfast. And when they have taken their seats in silence, they set down loaves in order, and next some one sort of food to eat along with <em>the bread</em>, and each receives from these a sufficient portion. No one, however, tastes these before the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> utters a blessing,  and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> over <em>the food</em>. And after breakfast, when he has a second time offered up supplication, as at the beginning, so at the conclusion of their meal they praise God in <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. Next, after they have laid aside as sacred the garments in which they have been clothed while together taking their repast within <em>the house</em>&mdash; (now <em>these garments</em> are linen)&mdash; and having resumed the <em>clothes which they had left</em> in the vestibule, they hasten to agreeable occupations until evening. And they partake of supper, doing oil things in like manner to those already mentioned. And no one will at any time cry aloud, nor will any other tumultuous voice be heard. But they each converse quietly, and with decorum one concedes the conversation to the other, so that the stillness of those within <em>the house</em> appears a sort of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> to those outside. And they are invariably sober, eating and drinking all things by measure.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17. The Tenets of the Esseni Continued.</h2>

<p>All then pay attention to the president; and whatever injunctions he will issue, they <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> as law. For they are anxious that mercy and assistance be extended to those that are burdened with toil. And especially they abstain from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and all such <em><a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a></em>, inasmuch as they consider these to be treacherous to man. And no one among them is in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of swearing; but whatever any one says, this is regarded more binding than an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. If, however, one will <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, he is condemned as one unworthy of credence. They are likewise solicitous about the readings of the law and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and moreover also, if there is any treatise of the faithful, <em>about that likewise</em>. And they evince the utmost curiosity concerning plants and stones, rather busying themselves as regards the operative powers of these, saying that these <em>things</em> were not created in vain.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. The Tenets of the Esseni Continued.</h2>

<p>But to those who wish to become <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, they do not immediately deliver their rules, unless they have previously tried <em>them</em>. Now for the space of a year they set before (the candidates) the same food, while the latter continue to live in a different house outside the <em><a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a></em>' own place of meeting. And they give (to the probationists) a hatchet and the linen girdle, and a white robe. When, at the expiration of this period, one affords <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of self-control, he approaches nearer to the <em><a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect's</a></em> method of living, and he is washed more purely than before. Not as yet, however, does he partake of food along with <em>the <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a></em>. For, after having furnished evidence as to whether he is able to acquire self-control,&mdash; but for two years the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of a person of this description is on trial&mdash;and when he has appeared deserving, he is thus reckoned among the members <em>of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a></em>. Previous, however, to his being allowed to partake of a repast along with them, he is bound under fearful oaths. First, that he will worship the Divinity; next, that he will observe just <em>dealings</em> with men, and that he will in no way injure any one, and that he will not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> a person who injures him, or is hostile to him, but <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them. He likewise swears that he will always aid the just, <em>and</em> keep <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with all, especially those who are rulers. For, <em>they argue</em>, a position of authority does not happen to any one without God. And if <em>the Essene</em> himself be a ruler, <em>he swears</em> that he will not conduct himself at any time arrogantly in <em>the exercise of</em> power, nor be prodigal, nor resort to any adornment, or a greater <em>state of magnificence</em> than the usage <em>permits</em>. <em>He likewise swears</em>, however, to be a lover of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and to reprove him that is guilty of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, neither to steal, nor pollute his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> for the sake of iniquitous gain, nor conceal <em>anything</em> from those that are members of his <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, and to divulge nothing to others, though one should be tortured even unto death. And in addition to the foregoing <em>promises</em>, he swears to impart to no one a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the doctrines in a different manner from that in which he has received them himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19. The Tenets of the Esseni Continued.</h2>

<p>With oaths, then, of this description, they bind those who come forward. If, however, any one may be condemned for any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he is expelled from the order; but one that has been <em>thus</em> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> sometimes perishes by an awful death. For, inasmuch as he is bound by the oaths and <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> <em>of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a></em>, he is not able to partake of the food in use among other people. <em>Those that are <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a></em>, occasionally, therefore, utterly destroy the body through starvation. And so it is, that when it comes to the last <em>the <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a></em> sometimes pity many <em>of them</em> who are at the point of dissolution, inasmuch as they deem a punishment even unto death, <em>thus inflicted</em> upon these <em>culprits</em>, a sufficient <em>penalty</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. The Tenets of the Esseni Concluded.</h2>

<p>But as regards judicial decisions, <em>the <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a></em> are most accurate and impartial. And they deliver their judgments when they have assembled together, <em>numbering</em> at the very least one hundred; and the sentence delivered by them is irreversible. And they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the legislator <em>next</em> after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and if any one is guilty of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against this <em>framer of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a></em>, he is punished. And they are taught to yield <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to rulers and elders; and if ten occupy seats in the same <em>room</em>, one <em>of them</em> will not speak unless it will appear expedient to the nine. And they are careful not to spit out into the midst of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> present, and to the right hand. They are more solicitous, however, about abstaining from work on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a> than all <em>other</em> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For not only do they prepare their victuals for themselves one day previously, so as not (on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>) to kindle a fire, but not even would they move a utensil from one place to another (on that day), nor ease nature; nay, some would not even rise from a couch. On other days, however, when they wish to relieve nature, they dig a hole a foot long with the mattock,&mdash; for of this description is the hatchet, which the president in the first instance gives those who come forward to gain admission as <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>&mdash;and cover (this cavity) on all sides with their garment, alleging that they do not necessarily  insult the sunbeams. They then replace the upturned soil into the pit; and this is their practice,  choosing the more lonely spots. But after they have performed this operation, immediately they undergo ablution, as if the excrement pollutes them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21. Different Sects of the Esseni.</h2>

<p> <em>The <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a></em> have, however, in the lapse of time, undergone divisions, and they do not preserve their system of training after a similar manner, inasmuch as they have been split up into four parties. For some of them discipline themselves above the requisite <em>rules of the order</em>, so that even they would not handle a current coin of the country, saying that they ought not either to carry, or behold, or fashion an image:  wherefore no one of those goes into a city, lest (by so doing) he should enter through a gate at which <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> are <em>erected</em>, regarding it a violation of law to pass beneath images. But the adherents of another party, if they happen to hear any one maintaining a discussion concerning God and His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>&mdash; supposing such to be an uncircumcised person, they will closely watch him and when they meet a person of this description in any place alone, they will threaten to slay him if he refuses to undergo the rite of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. Now, if the latter does not wish to comply with this request, <em>an Essene</em> spares not, but even slaughters. And it is from this occurrence that they have received their appellation, being denominated (by some) Zelotae, but by others Sicarii. And the adherents of another party call no one Lord except the Deity, even though one should put them to the torture, or even kill them. But there are <em>others</em> of a later period, who have to such an extent declined from the discipline (of the order), that, as far as those are concerned who continue in the primitive customs, they would not even touch these. And if they happen to come in contact with them, they immediately resort to ablution, as if they had touched one belonging to an alien tribe. But here also there are very many of them of so great longevity, as even to live longer than a hundred years. They assert, therefore, that a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this arises from their extreme devotion to religion, and their condemnation of all excess in regard of what is served up (as food), and from their being temperate and incapable of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. And so it is that they despise death, rejoicing when they can finish their course with a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. If, however, any one would even put to the torture <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of this description, in order to induce any among them either to speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the law, or eat what is offered in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to an idol, he will not effect his purpose; for <em>one of this party</em> submits to death and endures torment rather than violate his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22. Belief of the Esseni in the Resurrection; Their System a Suggestive One.</h2>

<p>Now the doctrine of the resurrection has also derived support among <em>these</em>; for they acknowledge both that the flesh will rise again, and that it will be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, in the same manner as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is already imperishable. <em>And they maintain</em> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when separated in the present life, (departs) into one place, which is well ventilated and lightsome, <em>where</em>, they say, <em>it</em> rests until judgment. And this locality the Greeks were acquainted with by hearsay, and called it <q>Isles of the Blessed.</q> And there are other tenets of these which many of the Greeks have appropriated, and thus have from time to time formed their own opinions.  For the disciplinary system in regard of the Divinity, according to these (Jewish <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>), is of greater antiquity than <em>that of</em> all nations. And so it is that the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is at hand, that all those (Greeks) who ventured to make assertions concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or concerning the creation of existing things, derived their principles from no other source than from Jewish legislation. And among these <em>may be particularized</em> Pythagoras especially, and the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, who derived (their systems) <em>while resident</em> among the Egyptians, by having become <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of these <em><a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></em>.  Now they affirm that there will be both a judgment and a conflagration of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> punished. And among them is cultivated the practice of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and the prediction of future events.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23. Another Sect of the Esseni: the Pharisees.</h2>

<p>There is then another order of the <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a> who use the same customs and prescribed method of living <em>with the foregoing <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a></em>, but make an alteration from these in one respect, viz., marriage. Now they maintain that those who have abrogated matrimony commit some terrible <em>offense, which</em> is for the destruction of life, and that they ought not to cut off the succession of children; <em>for</em>, that if all entertained this opinion, the entire race of men would easily be exterminated. However, they make a trial of their <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> for a period of three years; and when they have been three times purified, with a view of proving their ability of bringing forth children, so then they wed. They do not, however, cohabit with pregnant <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, evincing that they marry not from sensual motives, but from the advantage of children. And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> likewise undergo ablution in a similar manner (with their husbands), and are themselves also arrayed in a linen garment, after the mode in which the men <em>are</em> with their girdles. These <em>things</em>, then, <em>are the statements which I have to make</em> respecting the Esseni.</p>

<p>But there are also others who themselves practise the Jewish customs; and these, both in respect of caste and in respect of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, are called <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>. Now the greatest part of these is <em>to be found</em> in every locality, inasmuch as, though all are styled <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, yet, on account of the peculiarity of the opinions advanced by them, they have been denominated by titles proper <em>to each</em>. These, then, firmly hold the ancient tradition, and continue to pursue in a disputative spirit a close investigation into the things <em>regarded</em> according to <em>the</em> Law as clean and not clean. And they interpret the <em>regulations</em> of the Law, and put forward teachers, <em>whom they qualify</em> for <em>giving instruction in</em> such <em>things</em>. These <em><a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a></em> affirm the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, and that some things are in our power, whereas others are under the control of destiny. In this way <em>they maintain</em> that some <em>actions</em> depend upon ourselves, whereas others upon <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>. But (they assert) that God is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things, and that nothing is managed or happens without His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. These likewise acknowledge that there is a resurrection of flesh, and that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and that there will be a judgment and conflagration, and that the righteous will be imperishable, but that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will endure everlasting punishment in unqenchable fire.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24. The Sadducees.</h2>

<p>These, then, are the opinions even of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, however, are for abolishing <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, and they acknowledge that God does nothing that is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, nor exercises <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> over (earthly concerns); but <em>they contend</em> that the choice between good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> lies within the power of men. And they deny that there is a resurrection not only of flesh, but also they suppose that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not continue <em>after death. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> they consider nothing</em> but mere vitality, and that it is on account of this that man has been created. However, (they maintain) that the notion of the resurrection has been fully realized by the single circumstance, that we close our days after having left children upon earth. But (they still insist) that after death one expects to suffer nothing, either bad or good; for that there will be a dissolution both of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, and that man passes into non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, similarly also with the <em>material of</em> the animal creation. But as regards whatever <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> a man may have committed in life, provided he may have been reconciled <em>to the injured party</em>, he has been a gainer (by transgression), inasmuch as he has escaped the punishment (that otherwise would have been inflicted) by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And whatever acquisitions a man may have made. and (in whatever respect), by becoming <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>, he may have acquired distinction, he has so far been a gainer. But (they abide by their assertion), that God has no solicitude about the concerns of an individual <em>here</em>. And while the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> are full of mutual affection, the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, on the other hand, are actuated by self-<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. This <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> had its stronghold especially in <em>the region</em> around <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. And these also adhere to the customs of the law, saying that one ought so to live, that he may conduct himself virtuously, and leave children behind him on earth. They do not, however, devote attention to <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but neither <em>do they</em> to any other sages, except to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> only, <em>in regard of which</em>, however, they frame no interpretations. These, then, are the opinions which also the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> choose <em>to teach</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25. The Jewish Religion.</h2>

<p>Since, therefore, we have explained even the diversities among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, it seems expedient likewise not to pass over in silence the system of their religion. The doctrine, therefore, among all <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> on the subject of religion is fourfold-theological, natural, moral, <em>and</em> ceremonial. And they affirm that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, and that He is Creator and Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>: that He has formed all these <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> works which had no previous <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and this, too, not out of any coeval substance that lay ready at hand, but His Will&mdash; the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>&mdash; was <em>to create</em>, and He did create. And (they maintain) that there are <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and that these have been brought into being for ministering unto the creation; but also that there is a sovereign Spirit that always continues beside <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and praise. And that all things in the creation are endued with sensation, and that there is nothing inanimate. And they earnestly aim at serious habits and a temperate life, as one may ascertain from their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Now these <em>matters</em> have long ago been strictly defined by those who in ancient times have received the divinely-appointed law;  so that the reader will find himself astonished at the amount of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and of diligence, <em>lavished</em> on customs legally enacted in reference to man. The ceremonial service, however, which has been adapted to divine <em>worship</em> in a manner befitting the dignity <em>of religion</em>, has been practised among them with the highest degree of elaboration. The superiority of their ritualism it is easy for those who wish it to ascertain, provided they read the book which furnishes information on these points. <em>They will thus perceive</em> how that with <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> the <em>Jewish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a></em> offer unto God the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of the gifts bestowed by Him for the rise and enjoyment of men; <em>how</em> they fulfil their ministrations with regularity and steadfastness, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to His commandments. There are, however, some (liturgical usages adopted) by these, which the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> refuse to recognise, for they are not disposed to acquiesce in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or spirits.</p>

<p>Still all <em>parties</em> alike expect Messiah, inasmuch as the Law certainly, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, preached beforehand that He was about to be present <em>on earth</em>. Inasmuch, however, as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were not cognizant of the period of His advent, there remains the supposition that the declarations (of Scripture) concerning His coming have not been fulfilled. And so it is, that up to this day they continue in anticipation of the future coming of <em>the</em> Christ,&mdash; from the fact of their not discerning Him when He was present <em>in the world</em>. And (yet there can be little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but) that, on beholding the signs of the times of His having been already among us, <em>the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></em> are troubled; and that they are ashamed to confess that He has come, since they have with their own hands put Him to death, because they were stung with indignation in being convicted by Himself of not having <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. And they affirm that He who was thus sent forth by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not this Christ (whom they are looking for); but they confess that another <em>Messiah</em> will come, who as yet has no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and that he will usher in some of the signs which the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have shown beforehand, whereas, regarding the rest (of these indications), they suppose that they have fallen into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For they say that his generation will be from the stock of David, but not from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and <em>the</em> <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according as it is a rule for all to be procreated from seed. And they allege that this <em>Messiah</em> will be King over them&mdash;a warlike and powerful individual, who, after having gathered together the entire people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <em>and</em> having done battle with all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, will restore for them Jerusalem the royal city. And into this city He will collect together the entire <em>Hebrew</em> race, and bring it back once more into the ancient customs, that it may fulfil the regal and sacerdotal functions, and dwell in confidence for periods of time of sufficient duration. <em>After this repose, it is their opinion</em> that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> would next be waged against them after being thus congregated; that in this conflict Christ would fall by the edge of the sword; <em>and</em> that, after no long time, would next succeed the termination and conflagration of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; and that in this way their opinions concerning the resurrection would receive completion, and a recompense be rendered to each man according to his works.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26. Conclusion to the Work Explained.</h2>

<p>It now seems to us that the tenets of both all the Greeks and barbarians have been sufficiently explained by us, and that nothing has remained unrefuted either of the points about which <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> has been busied, or of the allegations advanced by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. And from these very explanations the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> is obvious, for having either purloined their doctrines, or derived contributions to them from some of those tenets elaborately worked out by the Greeks, and for having advanced (these opinions) as if they originated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Since, therefore, we have hurriedly passed through all <em>the systems</em> of these, and with much labour have, in the nine books, proclaimed all their opinions, and have left behind us for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> a small viaticum in life, and to those who are our contemporaries have afforded a desire of learning (with) great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and delight, we have considered it reasonable, as a crowning stroke to the entire <em>work</em>, to introduce the discourse (already mentioned) concerning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and to furnish our delineation of this in one book, namely the tenth. <em>Our object is</em>, that the reader, not only when made acquainted with the overthrow of those who have presumed to establish <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, may regard with scorn their idle <em>fancies</em>, but also, when brought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the power of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, may be placed in the way of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, by reposing that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in God which He so worthily deserves.</p>
