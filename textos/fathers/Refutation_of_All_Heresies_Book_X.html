<h1>Refutation of All Heresies (Book X)</h1>

<h2>Contents.</h2>

<p>The following are the contents of the tenth book of the <em>Refutation of all Heresies</em>:&mdash; </p>

<p>An Epitome of all Philosophers.</p>

<p>An Epitome of all Heresies.</p>

<p>And, in conclusion to all, what the Doctrine of the Truth is.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1. Recapitulation.</h2>

<p>After we have, not with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, burst through the labyrinth  of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, but have unravelled (their intricacies) through a refutation merely, or, in other words, by the force of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we approach the demonstration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <em>itself</em>. For then the artificial sophisms of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> will be exposed in all their inconsistency, when we shall succeed in establishing whence it is that the definition of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <em>has been derived. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></em> has not taken its principles from the wisdom of the Greeks, nor borrowed its doctrines, as secret <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, from the tenets of the Egyptians, which, albeit silly, are regarded among them with religious veneration as worthy of reliance. Nor has it been formed out of the fallacies which enunciate the incoherent (conclusions arrived at through the) curiosity of the Chaldeans. Nor does the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> owe its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to astonishment, through the operations of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, for the irrational frenzy of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a>. But <em>its definition</em> is constituted after the manner in which every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> definition is, viz., as simple and unadorned. A definition such as this, provided it is made manifest, will <em>of itself</em> refute <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. And although we have very frequently propounded demonstrations, and with sufficient fullness elucidated for those willing (to learn) the rule of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; yet even now, after having discussed all the opinions put forward by the Greeks and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, we have decided it not to be, at all events, unreasonable to introduce, as a sort of finishing stroke to the (nine) books <em>preceding</em>, this demonstration throughout the tenth book.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Summary of the Opinions of Philosophers.</h2>

<p>Having, therefore, embraced (a consideration of) the tenets of all the wise men among the Greeks in four books, and the doctrines propounded by the heresiarchs in five, we shall now exhibit the doctrine concerning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in one, having first presented in a summary the suppositions entertained <em>severally</em> by all. For the dogmatists of the Greeks, dividing <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> into three parts, in this manner devised from time to time their speculative systems;  some denominating their <em>system</em> Natural, and others Moral, but others Dialectical <em>Philosophy</em>. And <em>the ancient thinkers who called their science</em> Natural Philosophy, were those <em>mentioned in book i</em>. And the account which they furnished was after this mode: Some of them <em>derived</em> all things from one, whereas others from more things <em>than one</em>. And of those <em>who derived all things</em> from one, some <em>derived them</em> from what was devoid of quality, whereas others from what was endued with quality. And among those <em>who derived all things</em> from quality, some <em>derived them</em> from fire, and some from air, and some from water, and some from earth. And among those <em>who derived the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a></em> from more things <em>than one</em>, some <em>derived it</em> from numerable, but others from <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> quantities. And among those <em>who derived all things</em> from numerable quantities, some <em>derived them</em> from two, and others from four, and others from five, and others from six. And among those <em>who derived the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a></em> from <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> quantities, some <em>derived entities</em> from things similar to those generated, whereas others from things dissimilar. And among these some <em>derived entities</em> from things incapable of, whereas others from things capable of, passion. From a body devoid of quality and endued with unity, the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, then, accounted for the generation of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. For, according to them, matter devoid of quality, and in all its parts susceptible of change, constitutes an originating principle of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. For, when an alteration of this ensues, there is generated fire, air, water, earth. The followers, however, of Hippasus, and Anaximander, and Thales the Milesian, are disposed <em>to think</em> that all things have been generated from one (an entity), endued with quality. Hippasus of Metapontum and Heraclitus the Ephesian declared the origin <em>of things to be</em> from fire, whereas Anaximander from air, but Thales from water, and Xenophanes from earth. <q>For from earth,</q> says he, <q>are all things, and all things terminate in the earth.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Summary of the Opinions of Philosophers Continued.</h2>

<p>But among those <em>who derive all entities</em> from more things than one, and from numerable quantities, the poet Homer asserts that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> consists of two <em>substances</em>, namely earth and water; at one time expressing himself thus:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>The source of gods was Sea and Mother Earth.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>And on another occasion <em>thus</em>:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>But indeed you all might become water and earth.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>And Xenophanes of Colophon seems to coincide with him, for he says:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>We all are sprung from water and from earth.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>Euripides, however, (derives the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>) from earth and air, as one may ascertain from the following assertion of his:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>Mother of all, air and earth, I sing.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>But Empedocles <em>derives the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a></em> from four principles, expressing himself thus:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p>Four roots of all things hear you first
<br>Brilliant Jove, and life-giving Juno and Aidoneus,
<br>And Nestis, that with tears bedews the Mortal Font. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>Ocellus, however, the Lucanian, and Aristotle, <em>derive the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a></em> from five <em>principles</em>; for, along with the four elements, they have assumed the <em><a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a</em> fifth, and (that this is) a body with a circular motion; and they say that from this, things celestial have their being. But the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Empedocles supposed the generation of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> to have proceeded from six <em>principles</em>. For in the passage where he says, <q>Four roots of all things hear you first,</q> he produces generation out of four <em>principles</em>. When, however, he subjoins&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Ruinous Strife apart from these, equal in every point,
<br>And with them Friendship equal in length and breadth,  &mdash;
</p></blockquote>

<p>he also delivers six principles of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, four of them material&mdash; earth, water, fire, <em>and</em> air; but two of them formative&mdash; Friendship and Discord. The followers, however, of Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, and of Democritus, and of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, and multitudes of others, have given it as their opinion that the generation of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> <em>proceeds</em> from <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <em>numbers of atoms</em>; and we have previously made partial mention of these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. But Anaxagoras <em>derives the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a></em> from things similar to those that are being produced; whereas the followers of Democritus and <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> derived the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> from things both dissimilar (to the entities produced), and devoid of passion, that is, from atoms. But the followers of Heraclides of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, and of Asclepiades, <em>derived the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a></em> from things dissimilar (to the entities produced), and capable of passion, as if from incongruous corpuscles. But the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> affirm that these <em>entities</em> are from three principles&mdash; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Matter, and Exemplar. He divides matter, however, into four principles&mdash; fire, water, earth, <em>and</em> air. And (he says) that God is the Creator of this (matter), and that Mind is its exemplar. </p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Summary of the Opinions of Philosophers Continued.</h2>

<p>Persuaded, then, that the principle of physiology is confessedly discovered to be encumbered with difficulties for all these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, we ourselves also shall fearlessly declare concerning the examples of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as to how they are, and <em>as</em> we have felt confident <em>that they are</em>. But we shall previously furnish an explanation, in the way of epitome, of the tenets of the heresiarchs, in order that, by our having set before our readers the tenets of all made well known by this (plan of treatment), we may exhibit the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in a plain and familiar (form).</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. The Naasseni.</h2>

<p>But since it so appears expedient, let us begin first from the public worshippers of the serpent. The Naasseni call the first principle of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> a Man, and that the same also is a <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>; and they divide this <em>man</em> into three portions. For they say one part of him is rational, and another psychical, but a third earthly. And they style him Adamas, and suppose that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> <em>appertaining</em> to him is <em>the</em> originating <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the capacity of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> God. And <em>the Naassene asserts</em> that all these rational, and psychical, and earthly qualities have retired into Jesus, and that through Him these three substances simultaneously have spoken unto the three genera of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. These allege that there are three kinds <em>of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a></em>&mdash; angelic, psychical, <em>and</em> earthly; and that there are three churches&mdash; angelic, psychical, <em>and</em> earthly; and that the names for these <em>are</em>&mdash; chosen, called, <em>and</em> captive. These are the heads of doctrine advanced by them, as far as one may briefly comprehend them. They affirm that James, the <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>, delivered these tenets to Mariamne, <em>by such a statement</em> belying both.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. The Peratae.</h2>

<p>The Peratae, however, viz., Ademes the Carystian, and Euphrates the Peratic, say that there is some one world&mdash;this is the denomination they use&mdash;and affirming that it is divided into three parts. But of the threefold division, according to them, there is one principle, just like an immense fountain, capable of being by reason divided into <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> segments. And the first segment, and the one of more proximity, according to them, is the triad, and is called a perfect good, <em>and</em> a paternal magnitude. But the second portion of the triad is a certain multitude of, as it were, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> powers. The third <em>part</em>, however, <em>is</em> formal. And the first is unbegotten;  whence they expressly affirm that there are three Gods, three Logoi, three minds, (and) three men. For when the division has been accomplished, to each part of the world they assign both Gods, and Logoi, and men, and the rest. But from above, from uncreatedness and the first segment of the world, when afterwards the world had attained to its consummation, <em>the Peratic affirms</em> that there came down, in the times of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, a certain man with a threefold nature, and a threefold body, and a threefold power, named Christ, and that He possesses from the three parts of the world in Himself all the concretions and capacities of the world. And they are disposed <em>to think</em> that this is what has been declared, <q>in whom dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note051025"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse9">Colossians 2:9</a></span> And <em>they assert</em> that from the two worlds situated above&mdash; <em>namely</em>, both the unbegotten <em>one</em> and self-begotten <em>one</em>&mdash; there were borne down into this world in which we are, germs of all sorts of powers. And (they say) that Christ came down from above from uncreatedness, in order that, by His descent, all things that have been divided into three parts may be saved. For, says <em>the Peratic</em>, the things that have been borne down from above will ascend through Him; and the things that have plotted against those that have been borne down are heedlessly rejected,  and sent away to be punished. And <em>the Peratic</em> states that there are two parts which are saved&mdash; <em>that is</em>, those that are situated above&mdash; by having been separated from corruption, and that the third is destroyed, which he calls a formal world. These also are the tenets of the Peratae.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The Sethians.</h2>

<p>But to the Sethians it seems that there exist three principles, which have been precisely defined. And each of the principles is fitted by nature for being able to be generated, as in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> every art whatsoever <em>is developed</em> which is <em>capable of being</em> learned. <em>The result is the same</em> as when a child, by being long conversant with a musical instrument, becomes a musician; or with geometry a geometrician, or with any <em>other</em> art, with a similar result. And the essences of the principles, <em>the Sethians</em> say, are light and darkness. And in the midst of these is pure spirit; and the spirit, they say, is that which is placed intermediate between darkness, which is below, and light, which is above. It is not spirit, as a current of wind or a certain gentle breeze which may be felt, but just as if some fragrance of ointment or <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> made out of a refined mixture&mdash;a power diffusing itself by some impulse of fragrance which is inconceivable and superior to what one can express. Since, therefore, the light is above and the darkness below, and the spirit is intermediate between these, the light, also, as a ray of sun, shines from above on the underlying darkness. And the fragrance of the spirit is wafted onwards, occupying an intermediate position, and proceeds forth, just as is diffused the odour of incense-offerings (laid) upon the fire. Now the power of the things divided threefold being of this description, the power simultaneously of the spirit and of the light is below, in the darkness that is situated beneath. The darkness, however, they say, is a horrible water, into which the light along with the spirit is absorbed, and thus translated into a nature of this description. The darkness being then endued with intelligence, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that when the light has been removed from it the darkness continues desolate, devoid of radiance <em>and</em> splendour, power <em>and</em> efficiency, as well as impotent, (therefore,) by every effort of reflection and of reason, this makes an exertion to comprise in itself brilliancy, and a scintillation of light, along with the fragrance of the spirit. And of this they introduce the following image, expressing themselves thus: Just as the pupil of the eye appears dark beneath the underlying humours, but is illuminated by the spirit, so the darkness earnestly strives after the spirit, and has with itself all the powers which wish to retire and return. Now these are indefinitely <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, from which, when commingled, all things are figured and generated like seals. For just as a seal, when brought into contact with wax, produces a figure, (and yet the seal) itself remains of itself what it was, so also the powers, by coming into communion (one with the other), form all the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> kinds of animals. <em>The Sethians assert</em> that, therefore, from the primary concourse of the three principles was generated an image of <em>the</em> great seal, <em>namely</em> heaven and earth, having a form like a womb, possessing a navel in the midst. And so that the rest of the figures of all things were, like heaven and earth, fashioned similar to a womb.</p>

<p>And <em>the Sethians</em> say that from the water was produced a first-begotten principle, <em>namely</em> a vehement and boisterous wind, and that it is a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all generation, which creates a sort of heat and motion in the world from the motion of the waters. And <em>they maintain</em> that this <em>wind</em> is fashioned like the hissing of a serpent into a perfect image. And on this the world gazes and hurries into generation, being inflamed as a womb; and from thence they are disposed <em>to think</em> that the generation of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> has arisen. And they say that this wind constitutes a spirit, and that a perfect God has arisen from the fragrance of the waters, and that of the spirit, and <em>from</em> the brilliant light. And <em>they affirm</em> that mind exists after the mode of generation from a female&mdash; (meaning by mind) the supernal spark&mdash; and that, having been mingled beneath with the compounds of body, it earnestly desires to flee away, that escaping it may depart and not find dissolution on account of the deficiency in the waters. Wherefore it is in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of crying aloud from the mixture of the waters, according to the Psalmist, as they say, <q>For the entire anxiety of the light above is, that it may deliver the spark which is below from the Father beneath,</q>  <em>that is, from</em> wind. And <em>the Father</em> creates heat and disturbance, and produces for Himself a Son, <em>namely</em> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which, <em>as</em> they allege, is not the peculiar <em>offspring</em> of Himself. And <em>these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> affirm that the Son</em>, on beholding the perfect <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> of the supernal light, underwent a transformation, and in <em>the</em> shape of a serpent entered into a womb, in order that he might be able to recover that Mind <em>which is</em> the scintillation from the light. And that this is what has been declared, <q>Who, being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but made Himself of no <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, and took upon Him the form of a servant.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note051028"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians 2:6-7</a></span> And the wretched and baneful Sethians are disposed <em>to think</em> that this constitutes the servile form <em>alluded to by the Apostle</em>. These, then, are the assertions which likewise these <em>Sethians</em> advance.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Simon Magus.</h2>

<p>But that very sapient <em>fellow</em> Simon makes his statement thus, that there is an indefinite power, <em>and</em> that this is the root of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. And this indefinite power, he says, which is fire, is in itself not anything which is simple, as the gross bulk <em>of speculators maintain</em>, when they assert that there are four incomposite elements, and have supposed fire, <em>as one of these</em>, to be uncompounded. <em>Simon, on the other hand, alleges</em> that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of fire is twofold; and one portion of this twofold (nature) he calls a something secret, and another (a something) manifest. And <em>he asserts</em> that the secret is concealed in the manifest <em>parts</em> of the fire, and that the manifest <em>parts</em> of the fire have been produced from the secret. And he says that all the parts of the fire, visible and invisible, have been supposed to be in possession of a capacity of perception. The world, therefore, he says, that is begotten, has been produced from the unbegotten fire. And it commenced, he says, to exist thus: The Unbegotten One took six primal roots of the principle of generation from the principle of that fire. For <em>he maintains</em> that these roots have been generated in pairs from the fire; and these he denominates Mind and Intelligence, Voice and Name, Ratiocination and Reflection. And <em>he asserts</em> that in the six roots, at the same time, resides the indefinite power, <em>which</em> he affirms to be Him that stood, stands, and will stand. And when this <em>one</em> has been formed into a figure, He will, <em>according to this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a></em>, exist in the six powers substantially <em>and</em> potentially. <em>And He will be</em> in magnitude and perfection one and the same with that unbegotten and indefinite power, possessing no attribute in any respect more deficient than that unbegotten, and unalterable, and indefinite power. If, however, <em>He who stood, stands, and will stand</em>, continues to exist only potentially in the six powers, and has not assumed any definite figure, He becomes, says <em>Simon</em>, utterly evanescent, and perishes. <em>And this takes place</em> in the same manner as the grammatical or geometrical capacity, which, though it has been <em>implanted</em> in man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <em>suffers extinction</em> when it does not obtain (the assistance of) a master of <em>either of these</em> arts, who would indoctrinate <em>that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into its principles</em>. Now Simon affirms that he himself is He who stood, stands, <em>and</em> will stand, and that He is a power that is above all things. So far, then, for the opinions of Simon likewise.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Valentinus.</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>,  however, and the adherents of this school, though they agree in asserting that the originating principle of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is <em>the</em> Father, still they are impelled into the adoption of a contrary opinion <em>respecting Him</em>. For some of them <em>maintain</em> that (the Father) is solitary and generative; whereas others <em>hold</em> the impossibility, (in His as in other cases,) of procreation without a female. They therefore add Sige as <em>the</em> spouse of this <em>Father</em>, and style <em>the Father</em> Himself Bythus. From this <em>Father</em> and His spouse some <em>allege</em> that there have been six projections,&mdash; viz., Nous and Aletheia, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> and Zoe, Anthropos and Ecclesia&mdash;and that this constitutes the procreative Ogdoad. And <em>the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a> maintain</em> that those <em>are the first</em> projections which have taken place within the limit, <em>and</em> have been again denominated <q> <em>those</em> within the Pleroma; </q>and the second are <q>those without the Pleroma</q>; and the third, <q>those without the Limit.</q> Now the generation of these constitutes the Hysterema <em>Acamoth</em>. And he asserts that what has been generated from an Aeon, <em>that exists</em> in <em>the</em> Hysterema <em>and</em> has been projected (beyond the Limit), is the Creator. But <em><a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a></em> is not disposed <em>to affirm what is thus generated</em> to be primal Deity, but speaks in detractive terms both of Him and the things made by Him. And (he asserts) that Christ came down from within the Pleroma for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the spirit who had erred. This spirit, (according to the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a>,) resides in our inner man; and they say that this <em>inner man</em> obtains <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> on account of this indwelling <em>spirit</em>. <em><a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a></em>, however, (to uphold the doctrine,) determines that the flesh is not saved, and styles it <q>a leathern tunic,</q> and the perishable <em>portion of</em> man. I have (already) declared these tenets in the way of an epitome, inasmuch as in their systems there exists enlarged matter for discussion, and a variety of opinions. In this manner, then, it seems proper also to the school of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> <em>to propound their opinions</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Basilides.</h2>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> also himself affirms that there is a non-existent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who, being non-existent, has made the non-existent world, that has been formed out of things that are not, by casting down a certain seed, as it were a grain of mustard-seed, having in itself stem, leaves, branches, <em>and</em> fruit. Or <em>this seed is</em> as a peacock's egg, comprising in itself the varied multitude of colours. And this, say <em>the <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilidians</a></em>, constitutes the seed of the world, from which all things have been produced. For <em>they maintain</em> that it comprises in itself all things, as it were those that <em>as yet</em> are non-existent, and which it has been predetermined to be brought into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by the non-existent Deity. There was, then, he says, in the seed itself a threefold Sonship, in all respects of the same substance with the nonexistent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which has been begotten from things that are not. And of this Sonship, divided into three parts, one portion of it was refined, and another gross, and another requiring purification. The refined portion, when first the earliest putting down of the seed was accomplished by the non-existent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, immediately burst forth, and ascended upwards, and proceeded towards the non-existent <em>Deity</em>. For every nature yearns after that <em>God</em> on account of the excess of <em>His</em> beauty, but different (creatures desire Him) from different causes. The more gross portion, however, still continues in the seed; and inasmuch as it is a certain imitative <em>nature</em>, it was not able to soar upwards, for it was more gross than the subtle part. <em>The more gross portion</em>, however, equipped itself with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as it were with wings; for the Sonship, <em>thus</em> arrayed, shows kindness to this <em>Spirit</em>, and <em>in turn</em> receives kindness. The third Sonship, however, requires purification, <em>and therefore</em> this continued in the conglomeration of all germs, and this displays and receives kindness. And (<a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> asserts) that there is something which is called <q>world,</q> and something else (which is called) supra-mundane; for <em>entities</em> are distributed by him into two primary divisions. And what is intermediate between these he calls <q>Conterminous <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,</q> and (this Spirit) has <em>in itself</em> the fragrance of the Sonship.</p>

<p>From the conglomeration of all germs of the cosmical seed burnt forth and was begotten the Great Archon, the head of the world, <em>an Aeon</em> of inexpressible beauty and size. This (Archon) having raised Himself as far as the firmament, supposed that there was not another above Himself. And <em>accordingly</em> He became more brilliant and powerful than all the underlying <em>Aeons</em>, with the exception of the Sonship that had been left beneath, but which He was not aware was more wise than Himself. This one having His attention turned to the creation of the world, first begot a son unto Himself, superior to Himself; and this <em>son</em> He caused to sit on His own right hand, and this these <em><a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilidians</a></em> allege is the Ogdoad. <em>The Great Archon</em> Himself, then, produces the entire celestial creation. And other Archon ascended from (the conglomeration of) all the germs, <em>who was</em> greater than all the underlying <em>Aeon</em>, except the Sonship that had been left behind, yet far inferior to the former one. And they style this <em>second Archon</em> a Hebdomad. He is Maker, and Creator, and Controller of all things <em>that are</em> beneath Him, and this <em>Archon</em> produced for Himself a Son more <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> and wiser <em>than Himself</em>. Now they assert that all these things exist according to the predetermination of that non-existent <em>God</em>, and that there exist also worlds and intervals that are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. And <em>the <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilidians</a> affirm</em> that upon Jesus, who was born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, came the power of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, which descended and illuminated the Son both of the Ogdoad and of the Hebdomad. <em>And this took place</em> for the purpose of enlightening and distinguishing from the different orders of beings, and purifying the Sonship that had been left behind for conferring benefits on <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and the receiving benefits in turn. And they say that themselves are sons, who are in the world for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, that by teaching they may purify <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and along with the Sonship may ascend to the Father above, <em>from</em> whom proceeded the first Sonship. And they allege that the world endures until the period when all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> may have repaired there along with the Sonship. These, however, are the opinions which <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, who detailed them as prodigies, is not ashamed to advance.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Justinus.</h2>

<p>But Justinus also himself attempted to establish similar opinions with these, and expresses himself thus: That there are three unbegotten principles of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, two males <em>and</em> one female. And of the males one principle is denominated <q>Good.</q> Now this alone is called after this mode, <em>and is</em> endued with a foreknowledge of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. And the other <em>is</em> Father of all generated entities, <em>and is</em> devoid of foreknowledge, and unknown, and invisible, and is called Elohim. The female <em>principle is</em> devoid of foreknowledge, passionate, with two minds, <em>and</em> with two booties, as we have minutely detailed in the <em>previous</em> discourses concerning this <em><a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic's</a> system. This female principle</em>, in her upper parts, as far as the groin, is, <em>the Justinians say</em>, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, whereas from the groin downwards a snake. And such is denominated Edem and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. <em>This <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a></em> alleges that these are the principles of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, from which all things have been produced. And <em>he asserts</em> that Elohim, without foreknowledge, passed into inordinate desire for the half virgin, and that having had intercourse with her, he begot twelve <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and the names of these he states <em>to be those already given</em>. And <em>of these</em> the paternal ones are connected with the father, and the maternal with the mother. And <em>Justinus maintains</em> that these are (the trees of Paradise), concerning which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> has spoken in an allegorical sense the things written in the law. And <em>Justinus affirms</em> that all things were made by Elohim and Edem. And (he says) that animals, with a the rest <em>of the creatures of this kind</em>, are from the a part resembling a beast, whereas man from the parts above the groin. And Edem (is supposed by Justinus) to have deposited in <em>man</em> himself the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which was her own power, (but Elohim the spirit.) And <em>Justinus</em> alleges that this Elohim, after having learned <em>his origin</em>, ascended to the Good <em>Being</em>, and deserted Edem. And <em>this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> asserts that Edem</em>, enraged on account of such (treatment), concocted all this plot against the spirit of Elohim which he deposited in man. And (Justinus informs us) that for this reason the Father sent Baruch, and issued directions to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, in order that the spirit of Elohim might be delivered, and that all might be seduced away from Edem. But (this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>) alleges that even Hercules was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and that he was worsted by Omphale, that is, by Babel; and <em>the Justinians</em> call the latter Venus. And (they say) that afterwards, in the days of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, Jesus was born son of Mary and Joseph, to whom he alleges Baruch had spoken. And (Justinus asserts) that Edem plotted against this (Jesus), but could not deceive him; and for this reason, that she caused him to be crucified. And the spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, (says Justinus,) ascended to the Good <em>Being</em>. And (the Justinians maintain) that the spirits of all who thus <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> those silly and futile discourses will be saved, and that the body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Edem have been left behind. But the foolish Justinus calls this (Edem) Earth.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. The Docetae.</h2>

<p>Now the Docetae advance assertions of this description: that the primal Deity is as a seed of the fig-tree; and that from this proceeded three Aeons as the stem, and the leaves and the fruit; and that these projected thirty Aeons, each (of them) ten; and that they were all united in decades, but differed only in positions, as some were before others. And (the Docetae assert) that <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> Aeons were indefinitely projected, and that all these were hermaphrodites. And (they say) that these <em>Aeons</em> formed a design of simultaneously going together into one Aeon, and that from this the intermediate Aeon <em>and</em> from <em>the</em> Virgin Mary they begot a Saviour of all. <em>And this Redeemer was</em> like in every respect to the first seed of the fig-tree, but inferior in this respect, from the fact of His having been begotten; for the seed whence the fig-tree springs is unbegotten. <em>This</em>, then, was the great light of the Aeons&mdash; it was entirely radiance&mdash; which receives no adornment, and comprises in itself <em>the</em> forms of all animals. And the Docetae maintain that this <em>light</em>, on proceeding into the underlying chaos, afforded a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> (of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>) to the things that were produced, and those actually existing, and that on coming down from above it impressed on chaos beneath the forms of everlasting species. For the third Aeon, which had tripled itself, when he perceives that all his characteristic attributes were forcibly drawn off into the nether darkness, and not being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> both of the terror of darkness and the simplicity of light, proceeded to create heaven; and after having rendered firm what intervened, He separated the darkness from the light. As all the species of the third Aeon were, he says, overcome by the darkness, the figure even of this <em>Aeon</em> became a living fire, having been generated by light. And from this (source), they allege, was generated the Great Archon, regarding whom <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> converses, saying that He is a fiery Deity and <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a>, who also continually alters the forms of all (Aeons) into bodies. And the (Docetae) allege that these are the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> for whose sake the Saviour was begotten, and that He points out the way through which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will escape that are (now) overpowered (by darkness). And (the Docetae maintain) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> arrayed Himself in that only-begotten power, and that for this reason He could not be seen by any, on account of the excessive magnitude of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And they say that all the occurrences took place with Him as it has been written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Mono&iuml;mus.</h2>

<p>But the followers of Mono&iuml;mus the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> assert that the originating principle of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is a primal man and <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>; and that, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> states, the things that have been produced were produced not by the primal man, but by the Son of that primal man, <em>yet</em> not by the entire <em>Son</em>, but by part of Him. And (Mono&iuml;mus asserts) that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is iota, which stands for ten, the principal number in which is (inherent) the subsistence of all number (in general, and) through which every number (in particular) consists, as well as the generation of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, fire, air, water, <em>and</em> earth. But inasmuch as this is one iota and one tittle, <em>and</em> what is perfect (emanates) from what is perfect, <em>or, in other words</em>, a tittle flows down from above, containing all things in itself; (therefore,) whatsoever things also the man possesses, the Father of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> <em>possesses likewise</em>. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, therefore, says that the world was made in six days, that is, by six powers, out of which the world was made by the one tittle. For cubes, and octahedrons, and pyramids, and all figures similar to these, having equal superficies, out of which consist fire, air, water, <em>and</em> earth, have been produced from numbers comprehended in that simple tittle of the iota, which is <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>. When, therefore, says (Mono&iuml;mus), <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> mentions the rod's being brandished for the purpose <em>of bringing</em> the plagues upon <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, he alludes allegorically to the (alterations of the) world of iota; nor did he frame more than ten plagues. If, however, says he, you wish to become acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, search within yourself who is it that says, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, my flesh, <em>and</em> my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,</q> and who is it that appropriates each one thing unto himself, as another (would do) for himself. Understand that this is a perfect <em>one</em> arising from (one that is) perfect, and that he considers as his own all so-called nonentities and all entities. These, then, are the opinions of Mono&iuml;mus also.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Tatian.</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, however, similarly with <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> and the others, says that there are certain invisible Aeons, and that by some one of these the world below has been created, and the things existing <em>in it</em>. And he habituates himself to a very cynical  mode of life, and almost in nothing differs from <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, as appertaining both to his <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a>, and the regulations enacted concerning marriage.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Marcion and Cerdo.</h2>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, and Cerdon,  his preceptor, themselves also lay down that there are three principles of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>&mdash; good, just, <em>and</em> matter. Some <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, however, of these add <em>a fourth</em>, saying, good, just, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <em>and</em> matter. But they all affirm that the good (Being) has made nothing at all, though some denominate the just one <em>likewise</em> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whereas others that his only title is that of just. And they allege that (the just Being) made all things out of subjacent matter, for that he made them not well, but irrationally. For it is requisite that the things made should be similar to the maker; wherefore also they thus employ the evangelical <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, saying, <q>A good tree cannot bring forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note051032"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse18">Matthew 7:18</a></span> and the rest of the passage. <em>Now <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a></em> alleges that the conceptions badly devised by the (just one) himself constituted the allusion in this passage. And (he says) that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Son of the good Being, and was sent for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by him whom he styles the inner than. And he asserts that he appeared as a man <em>though</em> not being a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and as incarnate <em>though</em> not being incarnate. <em>And he maintains</em> that his manifestation was only phantastic, and that he underwent neither generation nor passion except in appearance. And he will not allow that flesh rises again; but in affirming marriage to be destruction, he leads his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> towards a very cynical life. And by these <em>means</em> he imagines that he annoys the Creator, if he should abstain from the things that are made or appointed by Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. Apelles.</h2>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of this <em><a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a></em>, was displeased at the statements advanced by his preceptor, as we have previously declared, and by another theory supposed that there are four gods. And the first of these he alleges to be the <q>Good Being,</q> whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and Christ to be His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. And the second <em><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he affirms</em> to be the Creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and Him he does not wish to be a God. And the third <em><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he states</em> to be the fiery one that was manifested; and the fourth to be an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one. And <em><a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a></em> calls these <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and by adding (to their number) Christ likewise, he will assert Him to be a fifth <em>God</em>. But <em>this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a></em> is in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of devoting his attention to a book which he calls <q>Revelations</q> of a certain Philumene, whom he considers a prophetess. And he affirms that Christ did not receive his flesh from the Virgin, but from the adjacent substance of the world. In this manner he composed his treatises against the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and attempts to abolish them as if they had spoken falsehoods, and had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> God. And <em><a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a></em>, similarly with <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, affirms that the different sorts of flesh are destroyed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17. Cerinthus.</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>, however, himself having been trained in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, determined that the world was not made by the first <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but by a certain angelic power. <em>And this power was</em> far separated and distant from that sovereignty which is above the entire circle of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the God (that is) above all things. And he says that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, but that He sprang from <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> <em>as their</em> son, similar to the rest of men; and that He excelled in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and understanding above all the rest <em>of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a></em>. And <em><a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> maintains</em> that, after Jesus' <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, Christ came down in the form of a dove upon Him from the sovereignty that is above the whole circle of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and that then He proceeded to preach the unknown Father, and to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. And <em>he asserts</em> that, at the conclusion of the passion, Christ flew away from Jesus,  but that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> suffered, and that Christ remained incapable of suffering, being a spirit of <em>the</em> Lord.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. The Ebionaeans.</h2>

<p>But the Ebionaeans assert that the world is made by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <em>they speak of</em> Christ in a similar manner with <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>. They live, however, in all respects according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, alleging that they are thus justified.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19. Theodotus.</h2> 

<p>But Theodotus of Byzantium introduced a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the following description, alleging that all things were created by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whereas that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he states, in a manner similar to that advocated by the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> already mentioned, made His appearance according to some mode of this description. And <em>Theodotus affirms</em> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is a man of a kindred nature with all <em>men</em>, but that He surpasses them in this respect, that, according to the counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He had been born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> had overshadowed <em>His mother. This <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, however, maintained that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a></em> had not assumed flesh in <em>the womb of</em> the Virgin, but that afterwards Christ descended upon Jesus at His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in form of a dove. And from this circumstance, <em>the followers of Theodotus</em> affirm that at first miraculous powers did not acquire operating energy in <em>Saviour</em> Himself. <em>Theodotus</em>, however, determines to deny the divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now, opinions of this description were advaned by Theodotus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. Melchisedecians.</h2>

<p>And others also make all their assertions similarly with those which have been already specified, introducing one only alteration, viz., in respect of regarding Melchisedec as a certain power. But they allege that <em>Melchisedec</em> himself is superior to all powers; and according to his image, they are desirous of <em>maintaining</em> that Christ likewise is <em>generated</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21. The Phrygians or Montanists.</h2>

<p>The Phrygians, however, derive the principles of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> from a certain <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>, and Priscilla, and Maximilla, and regard these wretched <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as prophetesses, and <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. In respect, however, of what appertains to the origin and creation of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, <em>the Phrygians</em> are supposed to express themselves correctly; while in the tenets which they enunciate respecting Christ, they have not irrelevantly formed their opinions. But they are seduced into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in common with <em>the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a></em> previously alluded to, and devote their attention to the discourses of these above the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, thus laying down regulations concerning novel and strange <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 22. The Phrygians or Montanists Continued.</h2>

<p>But others of them, being attached to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Noetians, entertain similar opinions to those relating to the silly <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> <em>of the Phrygians</em>, and to <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>. As regards, however, the truths appertaining to the Father of the entire of existing things, they are guilty of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, because they assert that He is Son and Father, visible and invisible, begotten and unbegotten, mortal and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. These have taken occasion from a certain Noetus <em>to put forward their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a></em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23. Noetus and Callistus.</h2>

<p>But in like manner, also, Noetus, being by birth a native of Smyrna, and a fellow addicted to reckless babbling, as well as crafty withal, introduced (among us) this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which originated from one Epigonus. It reached <em>Rome</em>, and was adopted by Cleomenes, and so has continued to this day among his successors. <em>Noetus</em> asserts that there is one Father and God of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and that He made all things, and was imperceptible to those that exist when He might so desire. <em>Noetus maintained that the Father</em> then appeared when He wished; and He is invisible when He is not seen, but visible when He is seen. And <em>this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> also alleges that the Father</em> is unbegotten when He is not generated, but begotten when He is born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; as also that He is not subject to suffering, and is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> when He does not suffer or die. When, however, His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>  came upon Him, <em>Noetus allows that the Father</em> suffers and dies. And <em>the Noetians</em> suppose that this Father Himself is called Son, (and <em><a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> versa</em>,) in reference to the events which at their own proper periods happen to them severally.</p>

<p>Callistus corroborated the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of these <em>Noetians</em>, but we have <em>already</em> carefully explained the details of his life. And <em>Callistus</em> himself produced likewise a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and derived its starting-points from these <em>Noetians</em>&mdash;namely, so far as he acknowledges that there is one Father and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, viz., the Creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and that this (God) is spoken of, and called by the name of Son, yet that in substance He is one Spirit. For Spirit, as the Deity, is, he says, not any <em>being</em> different from the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> from the Deity; therefore this one person, (according to Callistus,) is divided nominally, but substantially not so. He supposes this one <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and affirms that there was <em>in the case of the Word</em> an <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>. And he is disposed (to maintain), that He who was seen in the flesh and was crucified  is Son, but that the Father it is who dwells in Him. <em>Callistus thus</em> at one time branches off into the opinion of Noetus, but at another into that of Theodotus, and holds no sure doctrine. These, then, are the opinions of Callistus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24. Hermogenes.</h2>

<p>But one Hermogenes himself also being desirous of saying something, asserted that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made all things out of matter coeval <em>with Himself</em>, and subject <em>to His design</em>. For <em>Hermogenes</em>  held it to be an impossibility that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should make the things that were made, except out of existent things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25. The Elchasaites.</h2>

<p>But certain others, introducing as it were some novel <em>tenet</em>, appropriated <em>parts of their system</em> from all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and procured a strange volume, which bore on the title page the name of one Elchasai. These, in like manner, acknowledge that the principles of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> were originated by the Deity. They do not, however, confess that there is but one Christ, but that there is one that is superior <em>to the rest</em>, and that He is transfused into many bodies frequently, and was now in Jesus. And, in like manner, <em>these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> maintain</em> that at one time <em>Christ</em> was begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and at another time became the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and at another time <em>was born</em> of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and at another time not so. And <em>they affirm</em> that likewise this Jesus afterwards was continually being transfused into bodies, and was manifested in many (different bodies) at <em>different</em> times. And they resort to incantations and baptisms in their confession of elements. And they occupy themselves with bustling activity in regard of astrological and mathematical science, and of the arts of sorcery. But <em>also</em> they allege themselves to have powers of prescience.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26. Jewish Chronology.</h2>

<p> ... From Haran, a city of Mesopotamia, (<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, by the command)  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, transfers his residence into the country which is now called Palestine and <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, but then the region of Canaan. Now, concerning this territory, we have in part, but still not negligently, rendered an account in other discourses. From the circumstance, then, (of this migration) is traceable the beginning of an increase (of population) in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, which obtained its name from Judah, fourth son of Jacob, whose <em>name</em> was also called <em><a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></em>, from the fact that a race of kings would be descended from him.  <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> removes from Mesopotamia (when 75 years, and) when 100 years old he begot Isaac. But Isaac, when 60 years of age, begot Jacob. And Jacob, when 86 years old, begot Levi; and Levi, at 40 years of age, begot;  and Caath was four years of age when he went down with Jacob into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Therefore the entire period during which <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> sojourned, and the entire <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> descended from him by Isaac, in the country then called Canaanitis, was 215 years. But the father of this <em><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a></em> is Thare,  and of this <em>Thare the father is</em> Nachor, and of this <em>Nachor the father is</em> Serag, <em>and of this Serag the father is Reu, and of this Reu the father is Peleg, and of this Peleg</em> <span class="stiki" id="note051043"><a href="../bible/gen011.htm#verse16">Genesis 11:16</a></span> <em>the father is Heber</em>. And so it comes to pass that <em>the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></em> are denominated by the name of Hebrews. <em>In the time of Phaleg</em>,  <em>however, arose the dispersion of nations</em>. Now these nations were 72,  <em>corresponding with the number of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> children</em>. And the names of these nations we have likewise set down in other books, not even omitting this <em>point</em> in its own proper place. <em>And the reason of our particularity</em> is our desire to manifest to those who are of a studious disposition the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which we cherish towards the Divinity, and the indubitable <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> respecting the Truth, which in the course of our labours  we have acquired possession of. But of this Heber the father is Salah; and of this <em>Salah the father is</em> Ca&iuml;nan; and of this <em>Ca&iuml;nan the father is</em> Arphaxad, whose <em>father</em> is <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a>; and of this <em><a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a> the father is</em> <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>. And in <em><a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah's</a></em> time there occurred a flood throughout the entire world, which neither Egyptians, nor Chaldeans, nor Greeks recollect; for the inundations which took place in the age of Ogyges and Deucalion prevailed only in the localities where these dwelt.  There are, then, in the case of these (patriarchs&mdash; that is, from <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> to Heber inclusive)&mdash; 5 generations, <em>and</em> 495 years.  This <em><a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a></em>, inasmuch as he was a most religious and God-loving man, alone, with wife and children, and the three wives of these, escaped the flood that ensued. And he owed his preservation to an ark; and both the dimensions and relics of this <em>ark</em> are, as we have explained, shown to this day in the mountains called Ararat, which are situated in the direction of the country of the Adiabeni.  It is then possible for those who are disposed to investigate the subject industriously, to perceive how clearly has been demonstrated <em>the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of</em> a nation of worshippers of <em>the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a></em> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, more ancient than all <em>the</em> Chaldeans, Egyptians, <em>and</em> Greeks. What necessity, however, is there at present to specify those who, anterior to <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, were both devout men, and permitted to hold converse with <em>the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a></em> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as, so far as the subject taken in hand is concerned, this testimony in regard of the antiquity <em>of the people of God</em> is sufficient?</p>

<h2>Chapter 27. Jewish Chronology Continued.</h2>

<p>But since it does not seem irrational to prove that these nations that had their attention engrossed with <em>the speculations</em> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> are of more modern date than those that had <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> worshipped <em>the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a></em> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  it is reasonable that we should state both whence the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of these <em>latter originated</em>; and that when they took up their abode in these countries, they did not receive a name from the actual localities, but claimed for themselves <em>names</em> from those who were primarily born, and had inhabited these. <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> had three sons&mdash; <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a>, Ham, <em>and</em> Japheth. From these the entire <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of man was multiplied, and every quarter <em>of the earth</em> owes its inhabitants <em>in the first instance to these</em>. For the word of God to them prevailed, when <em>the Lord</em> said, <q>Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.</q> So great efficacy had <em>that</em> one word <em>that</em> from the three <em>sons of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a></em> are begotten in <em>the</em> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> 72 children&mdash;(viz.,) from <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a>, 25; from Japheth, 15; <em>and</em> from Ham, 32. Unto Ham, however, these 32 children are born in accordance with previous declarations. <em>And among Ham's children are</em>: Canaan,  from whom came the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaanites</a>; Mizraim, from whom the Egyptians; Cush, from whom the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a>; <em>and</em> Phut, from whom the Libyans. These, according to the language <em>prevalent</em> among them, are up to the present day styled by the appellation of their ancestors; nay, even in the Greek tongue they are called by the names by which they have been now denominated. But even supposing that neither these localities had been previously inhabited, nor that it could be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that a race of men from the beginning <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> there, nevertheless these sons of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, a worshipper of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are <em>quite sufficient to prove the point at issue. For it is evident that <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a></em> himself must have been a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of devout people, for which reason he escaped the tremendous, though transient, threat of water.</p>

<p>How, then, should not the worshippers of <em>the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a></em> God be of greater antiquity than all Chaldeans, Egyptians, <em>and</em> Greeks, for we must bear in mind that the father of these <em><a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a></em> was born from this Japheth,  and received the name Javan, and became the progenitor of Greeks and Ionians? Now, if the nations that devoted themselves to questions concerning <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> are shown to belong to a period altogether more recent than the race of the worshippers of God as well as <em>the time of</em> the deluge, how would not the nations of the barbarians, and as many <em>tribes</em> as in the world are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and unknown, appear to belong to a more modern epoch than these? Therefore you Greeks, Egyptians, Chaldeans, and the entire race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, become adepts in this doctrine, and learn from us, who are the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God is, and what His well-arranged creation. And we have cultivated this <em>system</em>, not expressing ourselves in mere pompous language, but executing our treatises in <em>terms that prove our</em> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and our practice of good sense, our object being the demonstration of His <em>Truth</em>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 28. The Doctrine of the Truth.</h2>

<p>The first and only (one God),  both Creator and Lord of all, had nothing coeval <em>with Himself</em>; not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> chaos, nor measureless water, nor solid earth, nor dense air, not warm fire, nor refined spirit, nor the azure canopy  of the stupendous firmament. But He was One, alone in Himself. By an exercise of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things that are, which antecedently had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, except that He willed to make them. For He is fully acquainted with whatever is about to take place, for foreknowledge also is present to Him. The different principles, however, of what will come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, He first fabricated, viz., fire and spirit, water and earth, from which diverse <em>elements</em> He proceeded to form His own creation. And some objects He formed of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but others He compounded from two, and others from three, and others from four. And those <em>formed</em> of one <em>substance</em> were <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, for <em>in their case</em> dissolution does not follow, for what is one will never be dissolved. Those, on the other hand, which are formed out of two, or three, or four <em>substances</em>, are dissoluble; wherefore also are they named mortal. For this has been denominated death; namely, the dissolution of <em>substances</em> connected. I now therefore think that I have sufficiently answered those endued with a sound <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, who, if they are desirous of additional instruction, and are disposed accurately to investigate the substances of these things, and the causes of the entire creation, will become acquainted with these points should they peruse a work of ours comprised (under the title), <em>Concerning the Substance of the Universe</em>.  I consider, however, that at present it is enough to elucidate those causes of which the Greeks, not being aware, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, in pompous phraseology, the parts of creation, while they remained <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the Creator. And from these the heresiarchs have taken occasion, and have transformed the statements previously made by those <em>Greeks</em> into similar doctrines, and thus have framed ridiculous <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29. The Doctrine of the Truth Continued.</h2>

<p>Therefore this solitary and supreme Deity, by an exercise of reflection, brought forth the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> first; not the word in the sense <em>of being articulated by</em> voice, but as a ratiocination of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, conceived and residing <em>in the divine mind</em>. Him alone He produced from existing things; for <em>the Father</em> Himself constituted <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and the being born from Him was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things that are produced.  The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> was in the Father Himself, bearing the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of His progenitor, and not being unacquainted with the mind of the Father. For simultaneously  with His procession from His Progenitor, inasmuch as He is this <em>Progenitor's</em> <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, He has, as a voice in Himself, the ideas conceived in the Father. And so it was, that when the Father ordered the world to come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> one by one completed <em>each object of creation, thus</em> pleasing God. And some things which multiply by generation  He formed male and female; but whatsoever beings were <em>designed</em> for service and ministration <em>He made</em> either male, or not requiring <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>, or neither male nor female. For even the primary substances of these, which were formed out of nonentities, viz., fire and spirit, water and earth, are neither male nor female; nor could male or female proceed from any one of these, were it not that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the source of all authority, wished that <em>the</em> <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> might render assistance  <em>in accomplishing a production of this kind</em>. I confess that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are of fire, and I maintain that female spirits are not present with them. And I am of opinion that sun and moon and stars, in like manner, <em>are produced</em> from fire and spirit, and are neither male nor female. And the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Creator is, that swimming and winged animals are from water, male and female. For so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose will it was, ordered that there should exist a moist substance, endued with productive power. And in like manner <em>God commanded</em>, that from earth should arise reptiles and beasts, as well males and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> of all sorts of animals; for so the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the things produced admitted. For as many things as He willed, God made from time to time. These things He created through <em>the</em> <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, it not being possible for things to be generated otherwise than as they were produced. But when, according as He willed, He also formed (objects), He called them by names, and thus notified <em>His creative effort</em>.  And <em>making</em> these, He formed the ruler of all, and fashioned him out of all composite substances.  <em>The Creator</em> did not wish to make him a god, and failed in His aim; nor an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>&mdash;be not deceived,&mdash; but a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For if He had willed to make you a god, He could have done so. You have the example of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>. His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, however, was, that you should be a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <em>and</em> He has made you a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But if you are desirous of also becoming a god, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him that has created you, and resist not now, in order that, being found faithful in that which is small, you may be enabled to have entrusted to you also that which is great. </p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> alone of this <em>God</em> is from <em>God</em> himself; wherefore also <em>the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a></em> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being <em>the</em> substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  Now the world was made from nothing; wherefore <em>it</em> is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <em>as also because</em> this <em>world</em> admits of dissolution whenever the Creator so wishes it. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who created <em>it</em>, did not, nor does not, make <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. He makes what is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and excellent; for He who makes <em>it</em> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Now man, that was brought into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, was a creature endued with a capacity of self-determination,  yet not possessing a sovereign <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>,  nor holding sway over all things by reflection, and authority, and power, but a slave <em>to his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a></em>, and comprising all <em>sorts of</em> contrarieties in himself. But man, from the fact of his possessing a capacity of self-determination, brings forth what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,  that is, accidentally; which <em><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></em> is not consummated unless you actually commit some piece of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. For it is in regard of our desiring anything that is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, or our meditating upon it, that what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <em>so</em> denominated. Evil had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from the beginning, but came into being subsequently.  Since man has <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, a law has been defined <em>for his guidance</em> by the Deity, not without answering a good purpose. For if man did not possess the power to will and not to will, why should a law be established? For a law will not be laid down for an animal devoid of reason, but a bridle and a whip;  whereas to man has been given a precept and penalty to perform, or for not carrying into execution what has been enjoined. For man thus constituted has a law been enacted by just men in primitive ages. Nearer our own day was there established a law, full of gravity and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, to whom allusion has been already made, a devout man, and one beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> of God controls all these; the first begotten Child of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the voice of the Dawn antecedent to the Morning Star.  Afterwards just men were born, friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <em>and</em> these have been styled <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>,  on account of their foreshowing future events. And the word <em>of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a></em>  was committed unto them, not for one age <em>only</em>; but also the utterances of events predicted throughout all generations, were vouchsafed in perfect clearness. And this, too, not at the time merely when <em>seers</em> furnished a reply to those present;  but also events that would happen throughout all ages, have been manifested beforehand; because, in speaking of incidents gone by, <em>the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a></em> brought them back to the recollection of humanity; whereas, in showing forth present occurrences, they endeavoured to persuade men not to be remiss; while, by foretelling future events, they have rendered each one of us terrified on beholding events that had been predicted long before, <em>and</em> on expecting likewise those events <em>predicted as</em> still future. Such is our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, O all you men,&mdash; <em>ours, I say</em>, who are not persuaded by empty expressions, nor caught away by sudden impulses of <em>the</em> heart, nor beguiled by the plausibility of eloquent discourses, yet who do not refuse to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> words that have been uttered by divine power. And these injunctions has God given to the Word. But the Word, by declaring them, promulgated the divine commandments, thereby turning man from disobedience, not bringing him into servitude by force of necessity, but summoning him to liberty through a choice involving spontaneity.</p>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> the Father in the latter <em>days</em> sent forth, no longer to speak by a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and not wishing that <em>the Word</em>, being obscurely proclaimed, should be made the subject of mere conjecture, but that He should be manifested, so that we could see Him with our own eyes. This <em><a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a></em>, I say, the Father sent forth, in order that <em>the</em> world, on beholding Him, might reverence Him who was delivering precepts not by <em>the</em> person of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, nor terrifying the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but who was Himself&mdash; He that had spoken&mdash; <em>corporally</em> present <em>among us</em>. This <em><a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a></em> we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have received a body from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, <em>and</em> to have remodelled the old man  by a new creation. <em>And we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a></em> to have passed through every period in <em>this</em> life, in order that He Himself might serve as a law for every age,  and that, by being present (among) us, He might exhibit His own manhood as an aim for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And that by Himself <em>in person</em> He might prove that God made nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that man possesses the capacity of self-determination, inasmuch as he is able to will and not to will, <em>and</em> is endued with power to do both.  This <em>Man</em> we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have been made out of the compound <em>of our humanity</em>. For if He were not of the same <em>nature with ourselves</em>, in vain does He ordain that we should imitate the Teacher. For if that Man happened to be of a different substance <em>from us</em>, why does He lay injunctions similar to those He has received on myself, who am born weak; and how is this <em>the act of one that is</em> good and just? In order, however, that He might not be supposed to be different <em>from us</em>, He even underwent toil, and was willing to endure hunger, and did not refuse to feel thirst, and sunk into the quietude of slumber. He did not protest against His Passion, but became <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> unto death, and manifested His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. Now in all these <em>acts</em> He offered up, as the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>, His own manhood, in order that you, when you are in tribulation, may not be disheartened, but, confessing yourself to be a man (of like nature with the Redeemer), may dwell in expectation of also receiving what <em>the Father</em> has granted unto this <em>Son</em>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 30. The Author's Concluding Address.</h2>

<p>Such is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine in regard of the divine nature, O you men, Greeks and Barbarians, Chaldeans and <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, Egyptians and Libyans, Indians and <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a>, Celts, and you Latins, who lead armies, and all you that inhabit <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and Asia, and Libya.  And to you I have become an adviser, inasmuch as I am a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <em>the</em> benevolent <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, and <em>hence</em> humane, in order that you may hasten and by us may be taught who the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God is, and <em>what</em> is His well-ordered creation. Do not devote your attention to the fallacies of artificial discourses, nor the vain promises of plagiarizing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>,  but to the venerable simplicity of unassuming <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And by means of this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> you shall escape the approaching threat of <em>the</em> fire of judgment, and the rayless scenery of gloomy Tartarus,  where never shines a beam from the irradiating voice of the Word!</p>

<p> <em>You shall escape</em> the boiling flood of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell's</a>  <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> lake of fire and the eye ever fixed in menacing glare of <em>fallen</em> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> chained in Tartarus as punishment for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; <em>and you shall escape</em> the worm that ceaselessly coils for food around the body whose scum  has bred <em>it</em>. Now such (torments) as these shall you avoid by being instructed in a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. And you shall possess an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> body, even one placed beyond the possibility of corruption, just like the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And you shall receive the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, you who, while you sojourned in <em>this</em> life, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the Celestial King. And you shall be a companion of the Deity, and a co-heir with Christ, no longer enslaved by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> or <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and <em>never again</em> wasted by disease. For you have become God:  for whatever sufferings you underwent while being a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, these He gave to you, because you were of mortal mould, but whatever it is consistent with God <em>to impart</em>, these God has promised to bestow upon you, because you have been deified, and begotten unto <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.  This constitutes <em>the import of the proverb</em>, <q>Know yourself; </q>i.e., discover God <em>within yourself, for</em> He has formed you <em>after His own image</em>. For with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of self is conjoined the being an object of God's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, for you are called by <em>the Deity</em> Himself. Be not therefore inflamed, O you men, with enmity one towards another, nor hesitate to retrace  with all speed your steps. For Christ is the God above all, and He has arranged to wash away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings,  rendering regenerate the old man. And God called man His likeness from the beginning, and has evinced in a figure His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards you. And provided you obey His solemn injunctions, and becomest a faithful follower of Him who is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, you shall resemble Him, inasmuch as you shall have <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> conferred upon you by Him. For the Deity, (by condescension,) does not diminish anything of the divinity of His divine  perfection; having made you even God unto His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>! </p>
