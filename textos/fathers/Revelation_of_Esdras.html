<h1>Revelation of Esdras</h1>

<p><strong>Word and Revelation of Esdras, the Holy Prophet and Beloved of God.</strong></p>

<p>It came to pass in the thirtieth year, on the twenty-second of the month, I was in my house. And I cried out and said to the Most High: Lord, give the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,  in order that I may see Your <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. And when it was night, there came an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, Michael the archangel, and says to me: O Prophet Esdras, refrain from bread for seventy <em>weeks</em>.  And I fasted as he told me. And there came Raphael the commander of the host, and gave me a storax rod. And I fasted twice sixty  weeks. And I saw the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. And I said to them: I wish to plead before God about the race of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man not to be born rather than to come into the world. I was therefore taken up into heaven, and I saw in the first heaven a great army of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and they took me to the judgments. And I heard a voice saying to me: Have mercy on us, O you chosen of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Esdras. Then began I to say: Woe to sinners when they see one who is just more than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and they themselves are in the Gehenna of fire! And Esdras said: Have mercy on the works of Your hands, You who is compassionate, and of great mercy. Judge me rather than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the sinners; for it is better that one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should be punished, and that the whole world should not come to destruction. And God said: I will give rest in paradise to the righteous, and I have become  merciful. And Esdras said: Lord, why do You confer benefits on the righteous? For just as one who has been hired out, and has served out his time, goes and again works as a slave when he come to his masters, so also the righteous has received his reward in the heavens. But have mercy on the sinners, for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that You are merciful. And God said: I do not see how I can have mercy upon them. And Esdras said: They cannot endure Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>. And God said: This is <em>the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a></em> of such. And God said: I wish to have you like <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and John, as you have given me uncorrupted the treasure that cannot be stolen, the treasure of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, the bulwark  of men. And Esdras said: It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man not to be born. It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> not to be in life. The irrational <em>creatures</em> are better than man, because they have no punishment; but You have taken us, and given us up to judgment. Woe to the sinners in the world to come! Because their judgment is endless, and the flame unquenchable. And while I was thus speaking to him, there came Michael and Gabriel, and all the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; and they said: Rejoice, O faithful man of God! And Esdras said:  Arise, and come hither with me, O Lord, to judgment. And the Lord said: Behold, I give you my covenant between me and you, that you may receive it. And Esdras said: Let us plead in Your hearing.  And God said: Ask <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> your father how a son pleads with his father,  and come plead with us. And Esdras said: As the Lord lives, I will not cease pleading with You in behalf of the race of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Where are Your ancient compassions, O Lord? Where is Your long-suffering? And God said: As I have made night and day, I have made the righteous and the sinner; and he should have lived like the righteous. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Who made <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> the first-formed? And God said: My undefiled hands. And I put him in paradise to guard the food of the tree of life; and thereafter he became disobedient, and did this in transgression. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Was he not protected by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>? And was not his life guarded by the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> to endless ages? And how was he deceived who was guarded by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>? For You commanded all to be present, and to attend to what was said by You.  But if You had not given him Eve, the serpent would not have deceived her;  but whom You will You save, and whom You will  You destroy.     And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Let us come, my Lord, to a second judgment. And God said: I cast fire upon <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Lord,  You deal  with us according to our deserts. And God said: Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> transcend my clemency. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Call to mind the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, my Father, who hast measured out Jerusalem, and set her up again. Have mercy, O Lord, upon sinners; have mercy upon Your own creatures;  have pity upon Your works. Then God remembered those whom He had made, and said to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: How can I have mercy upon them? Vinegar and gall did they give me to drink, <span class="stiki" id="note082501"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;27:34</a></span> and not even then did they repent. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Reveal Your <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, and let us go together to judgment; and show me the day of judgment, what like it is. And God said: You have been deceived, Esdras; for such is the day of judgment as that in which there is no rain upon the earth; for it is a merciful tribunal as compared with that day. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: I will not cease to plead with You, unless I see the day of the consummation. And God said:  Number the stars and the sand of the sea; and if you shall be able to number this, you are also able to plead with me. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Lord, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I wear <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh; and how can I count the stars of the heaven, and the sand of the sea? And God said: My chosen <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, no man will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that great day and the appearing  that comes to judge the world. For your sake, my <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, I have told you the day; but the hour have I not told you. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Lord, tell me also the years. And God said: If I see the righteousness of the world, that it has abounded, I will have patience with them; but if not, I will stretch forth my hand, and lay hold of the world by the four quarters, and bring them all together into the <a href="../cathen/08503a.htm">valley of Jehoshaphat</a>,  and I will wipe out the race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, so that the world shall be no more. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: And how can Your right hand be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>? And God said: I shall be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by my <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Lord, if You have resolved to do this, why did You make man? Thou said to our father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note082505"><a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;22:17</a></span> Multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand that is by the sea-shore;  and where is Your promise? And God said: First will I make an earthquake for the fall of four-footed beasts and of men; and when you see that brother gives up brother to death, and that children shall rise up against their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and that a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> forsakes her own husband, and when nation shall rise up against nation in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, then will you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the end is near. <span class="stiki" id="note082507"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm">Matthew&nbsp;xxiv</a></span> </p>

<p>For then neither brother pities brother, nor man wife, nor children <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, nor friends friends, nor a slave his master; for he who is the adversary of men shall come up from Tartarus, and shall show men many things. What shall I make of you, Esdras? And will you yet plead with me? And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Lord, I shall not cease to plead with You. And God said: Number the flowers of the earth. If you shall be able to number them, you are able also to plead with me. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Lord, I cannot number <em>them</em>. I wear <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh; but I shall not cease to plead with You. I wish, Lord, to see also the under parts of Tartarus. And God said: Come down and see. And He gave me Michael, and Gabriel, and other thirty-four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and I went down eighty-five steps, and they brought me down five hundred steps, and I saw a fiery throne, and an old man sitting upon it; and his judgment was merciless. And I said to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: Who is this? And what is his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? And they said to me: This is <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, who for a time was a king, and ordered to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> the children from two years old and under. <span class="stiki" id="note082508"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;2:16</a></span> And I said: Woe to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>! And again they took me down thirty steps, and I there saw boilings up of fire, and in them <em>there was</em> a multitude of sinners; and I heard their voice, but saw not their forms. And they took me down lower many steps, which I could not measure. And I there saw old men, and fiery pivots turning in their ears. And I said: Who are these? And what is their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? And they said to me: These are they who would not listen.  And they took me down again other five hundred steps, and I there saw the worm that sleeps not, and fire burning up the sinners. And they took me down to the lowest part of destruction, and I saw there the twelve plagues of the abyss. And they took me away to the south, and I saw there a man hanging by the eyelids; and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> kept scourging him. And I asked: Who is this? And what is his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? And Michael the commander said to me: This is one who lay with his mother; for having put into practice a small wish, he has been ordered to be hanged. And they took me away to the north, and I saw there a man bound with iron chains. And I asked: Who is this? And he said to me: This is he who said, I am the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, that made stones bread, and water wine. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: My lord, let me <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is his form, and I shall tell the race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that they may not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in him. And he said to me: The form of his countenance is like that of a wild beast; his right eye like the star that rises in the morning, and the other without motion; his mouth one cubit; his teeth span long; his fingers like scythes; the track of his feet of two spans; and in his face an inscription, <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. He has been exalted to heaven; he shall go down to Hades. <span class="stiki" id="note082510"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;11:23</a></span> At one time he shall become a child; at another, an old man. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Lord, and how do You permit him, and he deceives the race of men? And God said: Listen, my <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. He becomes both child and old man, and no one believes him that he is my beloved Son. And after this a trumpet, and the tombs shall be opened, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible. <span class="stiki" id="note082511"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse52">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:52</a></span> Then the adversary, hearing the dreadful threatening, shall be hidden in outer darkness. Then the heaven, and the earth, and the sea shall be destroyed. Then shall I burn the heaven eighty cubits, and the earth eight hundred cubits. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: And how has the heaven <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>? And God said: Since. ..there is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Lord, and the earth, how has it <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>? And God said: Since the adversary, having heard the dreadful threatening, shall be hidden, even on account of this will I melt the earth, and with it the opponent of the race of men. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Have mercy, Lord, upon the race of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. And I saw a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> hanging, and four wild beasts sucking her breasts. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said to me: She grudged to give her milk, but even threw her infants into the rivers. And I saw a dreadful darkness, and a night that had no stars nor moon; nor is there there young or old, nor brother with brother, nor mother with child, nor wife with husband. And I wept, and said: O Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have mercy upon the sinners. And as I said this, there came a cloud and snatched me up, and carried me away again into the heavens. And I saw there many judgments; and I wept bitterly, and said: It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man not to have come out of his mother's womb. And those who were in torment cried out, saying: Since you have come hither, O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> one of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we have found a little remission. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Blessed are they that weep for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And God said: Hear, O beloved Esdras. As a husbandman casts the seed of the grain into the ground, so also the man casts his seed into the parts of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. The first <em>month</em> it is all together; the second it increases in size; the third it gets hair; the fourth it gets nails; the fifth it is turned into milk;  and the sixth it is made ready, and receives life;  the seventh it is completely furnished; the ninth the barriers of the gate of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> are opened; and it is born safe and sound into the earth. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Lord, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for man not to have been born. Woe to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> then, when You shall come to judgment! And I said to the Lord: Lord, why have You created man, and delivered him up to judgment? And God said, with a lofty proclamation: I will not by any means have mercy on those who transgress my covenant. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Lord, where is Your goodness? And God said: I have prepared all things for man's sake, and man does not keep my commandments. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Lord, reveal to me the judgments and paradise. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> took me away towards the east, and I saw the tree of life. And I saw there <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, and Elias, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and Peter, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and Luke, and Matthias, and all the righteous, and the patriarchs. And I saw there the keeping of the air within bounds, and the blowing of the winds, and the storehouses of the ice, and the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> judgments. And I saw there a man hanging by the skull. And they said to me: This man removed landmarks. And I saw there great judgments.  And I said to the Lord: O Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and what man, then, who has been born has not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>? And they took me lower down into Tartarus, and I saw all the sinners lamenting and weeping and mourning bitterly. And I also wept, seeing the race of men thus tormented. Then God says to me: Do you <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a>, Esdras, the names of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> at the end of the world? Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, Gabuthelon, Aker, Arphugitonos, Beburos, Zebuleon.</p>

<p>Then there came a voice to me: Come hither and die, Esdras, my beloved; give that which has been entrusted to you.  And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: And whence can you bring forth my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said: We can put it forth through the mouth. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Mouth to mouth have I spoken with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note082517"><a href="../bible/deu034.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy&nbsp;34:10</a></span> and it comes not forth thence. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said: Let us bring it out through your nostrils. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: My nostrils have smelled the sweet savour of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said: We can bring it out through your eyes. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: My eyes have seen the back parts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note082518"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse23">Exodus&nbsp;33:23</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said: We can bring it out through the crown of your head. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: I walked about with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also on the mountain, and it comes not forth thence. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said: We can put it forth through the points of your nails. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: My feet also have walked about on the altar. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> went away without having done anything, saying: Lord, we cannot get his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Then He says to His only begotten Son: Go down, my beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, with a great host of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and take the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of my beloved Esdras. For the Lord, having taken a great host of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, says to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: Give me the trust which I entrusted to you; the crown has been prepared for you. <span class="stiki" id="note082519"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:8</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Lord, if Thou take my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from me, who will be left to plead with You for the race of men? And God said: As you are mortal, and of the earth, do not plead with me. And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: I will not cease to plead. And God said: Give up just now the trust; the crown has been prepared for you. Come and die, that you may obtain it. Then the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> began to say with tears: O Lord, what good have I done pleading with You, and I am going to fall down into the earth? Woe's me, woe's me, that I am going to be eaten up by worms! Weep, all you <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and you righteous, for me, who have pleaded much, and who am delivered up to death. Weep for me, all you <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and you righteous, because I have gone to the pit of Hades. And God said to him: Hear, Esdras, my beloved. I, who am <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, endured a cross; I tasted vinegar and gall; I was laid in a tomb, and I raised up my chosen ones; I called <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> up out of Hades, that <em>I might save</em> the race of men. Do not therefore be afraid of death: for that which is from me&mdash; that is to say, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash; goes to heaven; and that which is from the earth&mdash; that is to say, the body&mdash; goes to the earth, from which it was taken. <span class="stiki" id="note082521"><a href="../bible/ecc012.htm#verse7">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;12:7</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said: Woe's me! woe's me! What shall I set about? What shall I do? I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. And then the blessed Esdras began to say: O <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Maker of the whole creation, who hast measured the heaven with a span, and who holdest the earth as a handful,  who ridest upon the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, who took the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Elias to the heavens in a chariot of fire,  who givest food to all flesh, whom all things dread and tremble at from the face of Your power&mdash;listen to me, who have pleaded much, and give to all who transcribe this book, and have it, and remember my name, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> my memory, give them a blessing from heaven; and bless him  in all things, as You blessed Joseph at last, and remember not his former <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in the day of his judgment. And as many as have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> this book shall be burnt up like <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>. And there came to him a voice, saying: Esdras, my beloved, all things whatever you have asked will I give to each one. And immediately he gave up his precious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with much <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, in the month of October, on the twenty-eighth. And they prepared him for burial with <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> and psalms; and his precious and sacred body dispenses strength of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body perpetually to those who have recourse to him from a longing desire. To whom is due <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, strength, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and adoration,&mdash; to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, now and ever, and to ages of ages. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
