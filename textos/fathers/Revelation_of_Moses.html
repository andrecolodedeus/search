<h1>Revelation of Moses</h1>

<p>Account and life of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>, the first-created, revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to His servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when he received from the hand of the Lord the tables of the law of the covenant, instructed by the archangel Michael.</p>

<p>This is the account of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>. After they went forth out of paradise, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> took Eve his wife, and went up into the east. And he remained there eighteen years and two months; and Eve conceived and brought forth two sons, Diaphotus called Cain, and Amilabes  called Abel.</p>

<p>And after this, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> were with one another; and when they lay down, Eve said to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> her lord: My lord, I have seen in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> this night the blood of my son Amilabes, who is called Abel, thrown into the mouth of Cain his brother, and he drank it without pity. And he entreated him to grant him a little of it, but he did not listen to him, but drank it all up; and it did not remain in his belly, but came forth out of his mouth. And <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> said to Eve: Let us arise, and go and see what has happened to them, lest perchance the enemy should be in any way warring against them.</p>

<p>And having both gone, they found Abel killed by the hand of Cain his brother. And God says to the archangel Michael: Say to Adam, Do not relate the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which you know to your son Cain, for he is a son of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>. But grieve yourself not; for I will give you instead of him another son, who shall show you all things, as many as you shall do to him; but tell him nothing. This God said to His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; and <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> kept the word in his heart, and with him Eve also, having grief about Abel their son.</p>

<p>And after this, Adam <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his wife Eve, and she conceived and brought forth Seth. And <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> says to Eve: Behold, we have brought forth a son instead of Abel whom Cain slew; let us give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>And Adam had  thirty sons and thirty daughters.  And he fell into disease, and cried with a loud voice, and said: Let all my sons come to me, that I may see them before I die. And they were all brought together, for the earth was inhabited in three parts; and they all came to the door of the house into which he had entered to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And his son Seth said: Father Adam, what is your disease? And he says: My children, great trouble has hold of me. And they say: What is the trouble and disease? And Seth answered and said to him: Is it that you remember the <em>fruits</em> of paradise of which you ate, and grievest yourself because of the desire of them? If it is so, tell me, and I will go and bring you fruit from paradise. For I will put dung upon my head, and weep and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and the Lord will hearken to me, and send his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; and I shall bring <em>it</em> to you,  that your trouble may cease from you. <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> says to him: No, my son Seth; but I have disease and trouble. Seth says to him: And how have they come upon you? <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> said to him: When God made us, me and your mother, for whose sake also I die, He gave us every plant in paradise; but about one he commanded us not to eat of it, because on account of it we should die. And the hour was at hand for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who guarded your mother to go up and worship the Lord; and the enemy gave to her, and she ate of the tree, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that I was not near her, nor the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; then she gave me also to eat. And when we had both eaten, God was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with us. And the Lord, coming into paradise, set His throne, and called with a dreadful voice, saying, Adam, where are you? And why are you hidden from my face? Shall the house be hidden from him that built it? And He says, Since you have forsaken my covenant, I have brought upon your body seventy strokes.  The trouble of the first stroke is the injury of the eyes; the trouble of the second stroke, of the hearing; and so in succession, all the strokes shall overtake you.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> thus speaking to his sons, groaned out loud, and said: What shall I do? I am in great grief. And Eve also wept, saying: My lord Adam, arise, give me the half of your disease, and let me bear it, because through me this has happened to you; through me you are in distresses and troubles. And <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> said to Eve: Arise, and go with our son Seth near paradise, and put earth upon your heads, and weep, beseeching the Lord that He may have compassion upon me, and send His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to paradise, and give me of the tree in which flows the oil out of it, and that you may bring it to me; and I shall anoint myself, and have rest, and show you the manner in which we were deceived at first.</p>

<p>And Seth and Eve went into the regions of paradise. And as they were going along, Eve saw her son, and a wild beast fighting with him. And Eye wept, saying: Woe's me, woe's me; for if I come to the day of the resurrection, all who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> will curse me, saying, Eve did not keep the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And Eve cried out to the wild beast, saying: O you <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> wild beast, will you not be afraid to fight with the image of God? How has your mouth been opened? How have your teeth been strengthened? How have you not been mindful of your subjection, that you were formerly subject to the image of God? Then the wild beast cried out, saying: O Eve, not against us your upbraiding nor your weeping, but against yourself, since the beginning of the wild beasts was from you. How was your mouth opened to eat of the tree about which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had commanded you not to eat of it? For this reason also our nature has been changed. Now, therefore, you shall not be able to bear up, if I begin to reproach you. And Seth says to the wild beast: Shut your mouth and be silent, and stand off from the image of God till the day of judgment. Then the wild beast says to Seth: Behold, I stand off, Seth, from the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Then the wild beast fled, and left him wounded, and went to his covert.</p>

<p>And Seth went with his mother Eve near paradise: and they wept there, beseeching God to send His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, to give  them the oil of compassion. And God sent to them the archangel Michael, and he said to them these words: Seth, man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do not weary yourself <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in this supplication about the tree in which flows the oil to anoint your father Adam; for it will not happen to you now, but at the last times. Then shall arise all flesh from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> even to that great day, as many as shall be a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people; then shall be given to them all the delight of paradise, and God shall be in the midst of them; and there shall not any more be sinners before Him, because the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> heart shall be taken from them, and there shall be given to them a heart made to understand what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and to worship God only. Go again to your father, since the measure of his life has been fulfilled, equal to  three days. And when his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> goes out, you will behold its dreadful passage.</p>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, having said this, went away from them. And Seth and Eve came to the tent where <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was lying. And <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> says to Eve: Why did you work mischief against us, and bring upon us great <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, which is death, holding sway over all our race? And he says to her: Call all our children, and our children's children, and relate to them the manner of our transgression.</p>

<p>Then Eve says to them: Listen, all my children, and my children's children, and I shall relate to you how our enemy deceived us. It came to pass, while we were keeping paradise, that we kept each the portion allotted to him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And I was keeping in my lot the south and west. And the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> went into the lot of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> where were the male wild beasts; since God parted to us the wild beasts, and had given all the males to your father, and all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> He gave to me, and each of us watched his own. And the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> spoke to the serpent, saying, Arise, come to me, and I shall tell you a thing in which you may be of service. Then the serpent came to him, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> says to him, I hear that you are more sagacious than all the wild beasts, and I have come to make your acquaintance;  and I have found you greater than all the wild beasts, and they associate with you; notwithstanding, you do reverence to one far inferior. Why do you eat of the tares  of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and his wife, and not of the fruit of paradise? Arise and come hither, and we shall make him be cast out of paradise through his wife, as we also were cast out through him. The serpent says to him, I am afraid lest the Lord be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with me. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> says to him, Be not afraid; only become my instrument, and I will speak through your mouth a word by which you shall be able to deceive him. Then straightway he hung by the walls of paradise about the hour when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God went up to worship. Then <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> came in the form of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and praised God as did the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and looking out from the wall, I saw him like an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. And says he to me, Are you Eve? And I said to him, I am. And says he to me, What are you doing in paradise? And I said to him, God has set us to keep it, and to eat of it. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> answered me through the mouth of the serpent, You do well, but you do not eat of every plant. And I say to him, Yes, of every plant we eat, but one only which is in the midst of paradise, about which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has commanded us not to eat of it, since you will die the death. Then says the serpent to me, As God lives, I am grieved for you, because you are like cattle. For I do not wish you to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this; but rise, come hither, listen to me, and eat, and perceive the value of the tree, as He told us. But I said to him, I am afraid lest God be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with me. And he says to me, Be not afraid; for as soon as you eat, your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this, that you shall be like Him, has had a grudge against you, and said, You shall not eat of it. But observe the plant, and you shall see great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> about it. And I observed the plant, and saw great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> about it. And I said to him, It is beautiful to the eyes to perceive; and I was afraid to take of the fruit. And he says to me, Come, I will give to you: follow me. And I opened to him, and he came inside into paradise, and went through it before me. And having walked a little, he turned, and says to me, I have changed my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and will not give you to eat. And this he said, wishing at last to entice and destroy me. And he says to me, Swear to me that you will give also to your husband. And I said to him, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not by what <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> I shall <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> to you; but what I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I say to you, By the throne of the Lord, and the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, and the tree of life, I will give also to my husband to eat. And when he had taken the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> from me, then he went and ascended upon it. And he put upon the fruit which he gave me to eat the poison of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, that is, of his desire; for desire is the head  of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And I bent down the branch to the ground, and took of the fruit, and ate. And in that very hour my eyes were opened. and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that I was stripped  of the righteousness with which I had been clothed; and I wept, saying, What is this you have done to me, because I have been deprived of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with which I was clothed? And I wept too about the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. And he came down out of the tree, and went out of sight. And I sought leaves in my portion,  that I might cover my shame; and I did not find them from the plants of paradise, since, at the time that I ate, the leaves of all the plants in my portion fell, except of the fig alone. And having taken leaves off it, I made myself a girdle, and it is from those plants of which I ate. And I cried out with a loud voice, saying, Adam, Adam, where are you? Arise, come to me, and I shall show you a great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. And when your father came, I said to him words of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, which brought us down from great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For as soon as he came I opened my mouth, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> spoke; and I began to advise him, saying, Come hither, my lord Adam, listen to me, and eat of the fruit of the tree of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said to us not to eat of it, and you shall be as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And your father answered and said, I am afraid lest God be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with me. And I said to him, Be not afraid, for as soon as you shall eat you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And then I quickly persuaded him, and he ate; and his eyes were opened, and he was aware, he also, of his nakedness. And he says to me, O <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, why have you wrought mischief in us? You have alienated me from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And that same hour we heard the archangel Michael sounding his trumpet, calling the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, saying, Thus says the Lord, Come with me to paradise, and hear the word in which I judge Adam. And when we heard the archangel sounding, we said, Behold, God is coming into paradise to judge us. And we were afraid, and hid ourselves. And God came up into paradise, riding upon a chariot of <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> praising Him. When God came into paradise, the plants both of Adam's lot and of my lot bloomed, and all lifted themselves up; and the throne of God was made ready where the tree of life was. And God called Adam, saying, Adam, where are you hidden, thinking that I shall not find you? Shall the house be hidden from him that built it? Then your father answered and said, Not, Lord, did we hide ourselves as thinking that we should not be found by You; but I am afraid, because I am naked, and stand in awe of Your power, O Lord. God says to him, Who has shown you that you are naked, unless it be that you have forsaken my commandment which I gave you to keep it? Then <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> remembered the word which I spoke to him when I wished to deceive him, I will put you out of danger from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And he turned and said to me, Why have you done this? And I also remembered the word of the serpent, and said, The serpent deceived me. God says to Adam, Since you have disobeyed my commandment, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> your wife, cursed is the ground in your labours. For whenever you labour it, and it will not give its strength, thorns and thistles shall it raise for you; and in the sweat of your face shall you eat your bread. And you shall be in distresses of many kinds. You shall weary yourself, and rest not; you shall be afflicted by bitterness, and shall not taste of sweetness; you shall be afflicted by heat, and oppressed by cold; and you shall toil much, and not grow rich; and you shall make haste,  and not attain your end; and the wild beasts, of which you were lord, shall rise up against you in rebellion, because you have not kept my commandment. And having turned to me, the Lord says to me, Since you have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the serpent, and disobeyed my commandment, you shall be in distresses  and unbearable pains; you shall bring forth children with great tremblings; and in one hour shall you come <em>to bring them forth</em>,  and lose your life in consequence of your great straits and pangs. And you shall confess, and say, Lord, Lord, save me; and I shall not return to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the flesh. And on this account in your own words I shall judge you, on account of the enmity which the enemy has put in you; and you shall turn again to your husband, and he shall be your lord.  And after speaking thus to me, He spoke to the serpent in great <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, saying to him, Since you have done this, and have become an ungracious instrument until you should deceive those that were remiss in heart, cursed are you of all the beasts. You shall be deprived of the food which you eat, and dust shall you eat all the days of your life; upon your breast and belly shall you go, and you shall be deprived both of your hands and feet; there shall not be granted you ear, nor wing, nor one limb of all which those have whom you have enticed by your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and have caused them to be cast out of paradise. And I shall put enmity between you and between his seed. He shall lie in wait for  your head, and you for his heel, until the day of judgment. And having thus said, He commands His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that we be cast out of paradise. And as we were being driven along, and were lamenting, your father <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> entreated the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, saying, Allow me a little, that I may entreat <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that He may have compassion upon me, and pity me, for I only have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. And they stopped driving him. And <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> cried out with weeping, saying, Pardon me, Lord, what I have done. Then says the Lord to His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, Why have you stopped driving <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> out of paradise? It is not that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is mine, or that I have judged ill? Then the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, falling to the ground, worshipped the Lord, saying, Just are You, Lord, and judgest what is right. And turning to Adam, the Lord said, I will not permit you henceforth to be in paradise. And <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> answered and said, Lord, give me of the tree of life, that I may eat before I am cast out. Then the Lord said to Adam, You shall not now take of it, for it has been assigned to the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> and the flaming sword, which turns to guard it on account of you, that you may not taste of it and be free from death for ever, but that you may have the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which the enemy has set in you. But when you are gone out of paradise, if you shall keep yourself from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as being destined to die, I will again raise you up when the resurrection comes, and then there shall be given you of the tree of life, and you shall be free from death for ever. And having thus said, the Lord commanded us to be cast out of paradise. And your father wept before the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> over against paradise. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> say to him, What do you wish that we should do for you, Adam? And your father answered and said to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, Behold, you cast me out. I beseech you, allow me to take sweet odours out of paradise, in order that, after I go out, I may offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that God may listen to me. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, advancing, said to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Jael, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> King, order to be given to Adam <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>  of sweet odour out of paradise. And God ordered <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to go, that he might take perfumes of sweet odour out of paradise for his food. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> let him go, and he gathered both kinds&mdash; saffron and spikenard, and calamus  and cinnamon, and other seeds for his food; and having taken them, he went forth out of paradise. And we came to the earth. </p>

<p>Now, then, my children, I have shown you the manner in which we were deceived. But do ye watch over yourselves, so as not to forsake what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</p>

<p>And when she had thus spoken in the midst of her sons, and <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was lying in his disease, and he had one other day before going out of the body, Eve says to Adam: Why is it that you die, and I live? Or how long time have I to spend after you die, tell me. Then says <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to Eve: Do not trouble yourself about matters; for you will not be long after me, but we shall both die alike, and you will be laid into my place.  And when I am dead you will leave  me, and let no one touch me, until the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord shall say something about me; for God will not forget me, but will seek His own vessel which He fashioned. Arise, rather, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to God until I restore my spirit into the hands of Him who has given it; because we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how we shall meet Him who made us, whether He shall be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with us, or turn and have mercy upon us. Then arose Eve, and went outside; and falling to the ground, she said: I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, O Father of all; I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> to You, I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against Your chosen <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against Your unshaken throne; I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, O Lord, I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> much, I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> before You, and every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>  through me has come upon the creation. And while Eve was still <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, being on her knees, behold, there came to her the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of humanity, and raised her up, saying: Arise, Eve, from your repentance; for, behold, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> your husband has gone forth from his body; arise and see his spirit carried up to Him that made  it, to meet Him.</p>

<p>And Eve arose, and covered her face with her hand; and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> says to her: Raise yourself from the things of earth. And Eve gazed up into heaven, and she saw a chariot of light going along under four shining eagles&mdash; and it was not possible for any one born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>  to tell the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of them, or to see the face of them&mdash; and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> going before the chariot. And when they came to the place where your father <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was lying, the chariot stood still, and the seraphim between your father and the chariot. And I saw golden censers, and three vials; and, behold, all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> with <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and the censers, and the vials, came to the altar, and blew them up, and the smoke of the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> covered the firmaments. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> fell down and worshipped <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, crying out and saying: Holy Jael, forgive; for he is Your image, and the work of Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hands.</p>

<p>And again, I Eve saw two great and awful <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> standing before God. And I wept for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and cried out to my son Seth, saying: Arise, Seth, from the body of your father Adam, and come to me, that you may see what the eye of no one has ever seen; and they are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for your father Adam. </p>

<p>Then Seth arose and went to his mother, and said to her: What has befallen you? And why do you weep? She says to him: Look up with your eyes, and see the seven firmaments opened, and see with your eyes how the body of your father lies upon its face, and all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> with him, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for him, and saying: Pardon him, O Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; for he is Your image. What then, my child Seth, will this be? And when will he be delivered into the hands of our invisible Father and God? And who are the two dark-faced ones who stand by at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of your father? And Seth says to his mother: These are the sun and the moon, and they are falling down and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for my father Adam. Eve says to him: And where is their light, and why have they become black-looking? And Seth says to her: They cannot shine in the presence of the Light of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>,  and for this reason the light from them has been hidden.</p>

<p>And while Seth was speaking to his mother, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> lying upon their faces sounded their trumpets, and cried out with an awful voice, saying, Blessed be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord upon what He has made, for He has had compassion upon Adam, the work of His hands. When the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> had sounded this forth, there came one of the six-winged seraphim, and hurried <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to the Acherusian lake, and washed him in presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And he spent three hours  lying, and thus the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, sitting upon His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> throne, stretched forth His hands, and raised Adam, and delivered him to the archangel Michael, saying to him: Raise him into paradise, even to the third heaven, and let him be there until that great and dreadful day which I am to bring upon the world. And the archangel Michael, having taken Adam, led him away, and anointed him, as God said to him at the pardoning of Adam.</p>

<p>After all these things, therefore, the archangel asked about the funeral <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of the remains; and God commanded that all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> should come together into His presence, each according to his rank. And all the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were assembled, some with censers, some with trumpets. And the Lord of Hosts went up,  and the winds drew Him, and <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> riding upon the winds, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of heaven went before Him; and they came to where the body of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was, and took it. And they came to paradise, and all the trees of paradise were moved so that all begotten from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> hung their heads in sleep at the sweet smell, except Seth, because he had been begotten according to the appointment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>The body of Adam, then, was lying on the ground in paradise, and Seth was grieved exceedingly about him. And the Lord God says: Adam, why have you done this? If you had kept my commandment, those that brought you down to this place would not have rejoiced. Nevertheless I say unto you, that I will turn their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> into grief, but I will turn your grief into <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; and having turned, I will set you in your kingdom, on the throne of him that deceived you; and he shall be cast into this place, that you may sit upon him. Then shall be condemned, he and those who hear him; and they shall be much grieved, and shall weep, seeing you sitting upon his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> throne.</p>

<p>And then He said to the archangel Michael: Go into paradise, into the third heaven, and bring me three cloths of fine linen and silk. And God said to Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael:  Cover Adam's body with the cloths, and bring olive oil of sweet odour, and pour upon him. And having thus done, they prepared his body for burial. And the Lord said: Let also the body of Abel be brought. And having brought other cloths, they prepared it also for burial, since it had not been prepared for burial since the day on which his brother Cain slew him. For the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> Cain, having taken great pains to hide it, had not been able; for the earth did not receive it, saying: I will not receive a body into companionship  until that dust which was taken up and fashioned upon me come to me. And then the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> took it up, and laid it on the rock until his father died. And both were buried, according to the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the regions of paradise, in the place in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> found the dust.  And God sent seven <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> into paradise, and they brought many sweet-smelling herbs, and laid them in the earth; and thus they took the two bodies, and buried them in the place which they had dug and built.</p>

<p>And God called Adam, and said: Adam, Adam. And the body answered out of the ground, and said: Here am I, Lord. And the Lord says to him: I said to you, Dust  you are, and unto dust you shall return. Again I promise you the resurrection. I will raise you up in the last day in the resurrection, with every man who is of your seed.</p>

<p>And after these words God made a three-cornered seal, and sealed the tomb, that no one should do anything to him in the six days, until his rib should return to him. And the beneficent God and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> having laid him in his place, after the six days Eve also died. And while she lived she wept about her falling asleep, because she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not where her body was to be laid. For when the Lord was present in paradise when they buried Adam, both she and her children fell asleep, except Seth, as I said. And Eve, in the hour of her death, besought that she might be buried where <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> her husband was, saying thus: My Lord, Lord and God of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, do not separate me, Your servant, from the body of Adam, for of his members You made me; but grant to me, even me, the unworthy and the sinner, to be buried by his body. And as I was along with him in paradise, and not separated from him after the transgression, so also let no one separate us. After having <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, therefore, she looked up into heaven, and stood up, and said, beating her breast: God of all, receive my spirit. And straightway she gave up her spirit to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>And when she was dead, the archangel Michael stood beside her; and there came three <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and took her body, and buried it where the body of Abel was. And the archangel Michael said to Seth: Thus bury every man that dies, until the day of the resurrection. And after having given this law, he said to him: Do not mourn beyond six days. And on the seventh day, rest, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in it, because in it God and we the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the righteous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that has departed from earth. Having thus spoken, the archangel Michael went up into heaven, glorifying, and saying the <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>:  Holy, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Lord, to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because to Him is due <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and adoration, with His unbeginning and life-giving Spirit, now and ever, and to ages of ages. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
