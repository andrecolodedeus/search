<h1>Scorpiace</h1>

<p> <em>Antidote for the Scorpion's Sting. </em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>The earth brings forth, as if by suppuration, great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from the diminutive scorpion. The poisons are as many as are the kinds of it, the disasters as many as are also the species of it, the pains as many as are also the colours of it. Nicander writes <em>on the subject of scorpions</em>, and depicts them. And yet to smite with the tail&mdash; which tail will be whatever is prolonged from the hindmost part of the body, and scourges&mdash; is the one movement which they all use when making an assault. Wherefore that succession of knots in the scorpion, which in the inside is a thin poisoned veinlet, rising up with a bow-like bound, draws tight a barbed sting at the end, after the manner of an engine for shooting missiles. From which circumstance they also call after the scorpion, the warlike implement which, by its being drawn back, gives an impetus to the arrows. The point in their case is also a duct of extreme minuteness, to inflict the wound; and where it penetrates, it pours out poison. The usual time of danger is the summer season: fierceness hoists the sail when the wind is from the south and the south-west. Among cures, <em>certain</em> substances supplied by nature have very great efficacy; magic also puts on some bandage; the art of healing counteracts with lancet and cup. For some, making haste, take also beforehand a protecting draught; but sexual intercourse drains it off, and they are dry again. We have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for a defence, if we are not smitten with distrust itself also, in immediately making the sign  and adjuring,  and besmearing the heel with the beast. Finally, we often aid in this way even the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, seeing we have been endowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with that power which the apostle first used when he despised the viper's bite. <span class="stiki" id="note038218"><a href="../bible/act028.htm#verse3">Acts&nbsp;28:3</a></span> What, then, does this pen of yours offer, if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is safe by what it has of its own? That it may be safe by what it has of its own also at other times, when it is subjected to scorpions of its own. These, too, have a troublesome littleness, and are of different sorts, and are armed in one manner, and are stirred up at a definite time, and that not another than one of burning heat. This among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> is a <em>season of</em> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. When, therefore, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is greatly agitated, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> burning, as represented by the bush, <span class="stiki" id="note038219"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse2">Exodus&nbsp;3:2</a></span> then the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> break out, then the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a> creep forth, then all the opponents of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> bubble up, being themselves also hot to strike, penetrate, kill. For, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that many are artless and also inexperienced, and weak moreover, that a very great number in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who veer about with the wind and conform to its moods, they perceive that they are never to be approached more than when <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> has opened the entrances to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, especially when some <em>display of</em> ferocity has already arrayed with a crown the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Therefore, drawing along the tail hitherto, they first of all apply it to the feelings, or whip with it as if on empty space. Innocent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> undergo such suffering. So that you may suppose <em>the speaker</em> to be a brother or a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> of the better sort. A <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> troublesome to nobody so dealt with! Then they pierce. Men are perishing without a reason. For that they are perishing, and without a reason, is the first insertion. Then they now strike mortally. But the unsophisticated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>  <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what is written, and what meaning it bears, where and when and before whom we must confess, <em>or ought</em>, save that this, to die for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is, since He preserves me, not even artlessness, but folly, nay <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. If He kills me, how will it be His duty to preserve me? Once for all Christ died for us, once for all He was slain that we might not be slain. If He demands the like from me in return, does He also look for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from my death by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>? Or does God importune for the blood of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, especially if He refuses that of bulls and he-goats?  Assuredly He had rather have the repentance than the death of the sinner. <span class="stiki" id="note038222"><a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse11">Ezekiel&nbsp;33:11</a></span> And how is He eager for the death of those who are not sinners? Whom will not these, and perhaps other subtle devices containing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> poisons, pierce either for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> if not for destruction, or for irritation if not for death? As for you, therefore, do you, if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is on the alert, smite on the spot the scorpion with a curse, so far as you can, with your sandal, and leave it dying in its own stupefaction? But if it gluts the wound, it drives the poison inwards, and makes it hasten into the bowels; immediately all the former senses become dull, the blood of the mind freezes, the flesh of the spirit pines away, loathing for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name is accompanied by a sense of sourness. Already the understanding also seeks for itself a place where it may throw up; and thus, once for all, the weakness with which it has been smitten breathes out wounded <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> either in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>. And now the present state of matters is <em>such, that we are in</em> the midst of an intense heat, the very dog-star of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>&mdash;a state originating doubtless with the dog-headed one himself.  Of some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the fire, of others the sword, of others the beasts, have made trial; others are hungering in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> of which they have had a taste in the meantime by being subjected to clubs and claws  besides. We ourselves, having been appointed for pursuit, are like hares being hemmed in from a distance; and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> go about according to their wont. Therefore the state of the times has prompted me to prepare by my pen, in opposition to the little beasts which trouble our <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, our antidote against poison, that I may thereby effect cures. You who read will at the same time drink. Nor is the draught bitter. If the utterances of the Lord are sweeter than honey and the honeycombs,  the juices are from that source. If the promise of God flows with milk and honey, <span class="stiki" id="note038226"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse17">Exodus&nbsp;3:17</a></span> the ingredients which go to make that draught have the smack of this. <q>But woe to them who turn sweet into bitter, and light into darkness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038227"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;5:20</a></span> For, in like manner, they also who oppose <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>, representing <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to be destruction, transmute sweet into bitter, as well as light into darkness; and thus, by preferring this very wretched life to that most blessed one, they put bitter for sweet, as well as darkness for light.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>But not yet about the good to be got from <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> must we learn, without our having first <em>heard</em> about the duty of suffering it; nor must we <em>learn</em> the usefulness of it, before we have <em>heard</em> about the necessity for it. The (question of the) divine warrant goes first&mdash; whether God has willed and also commanded ought of the kind, so that they who assert that it is not good are not plied with arguments for thinking it profitable save when they have been subdued.  It is proper that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> be driven  to duty, not enticed. Obstinacy must be conquered, not coaxed. And, certainly, that will be pronounced beforehand quite good enough, which will be shown to have been instituted and also enjoined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Let the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> wait a little, while I set forth their root the Law, while I ascertain the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from those writings from which I recall to mind Himself also: <q> <em>I</em> am,</q> says He, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who have brought you out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. You shall have no other gods besides me. You shall not make unto you a likeness of those things which are in heaven, and which are in the earth beneath, and which are in the sea under the earth. You shall not worship them, nor serve them. For I am the Lord your God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038230"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse2">Exodus&nbsp;20:2</a></span> Likewise in the same <em>book of</em> Exodus: <q>You yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. You shall not make unto you gods of silver, neither shall you make unto you gods of gold.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038231"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse22">Exodus&nbsp;20:22-23</a></span> To the following effect also, in Deuteronomy: <q>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; The Lord your God is one: and you shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart and all your might, and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038232"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:4</a></span> And again: <q>Neither do you forget the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who brought you forth from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, out of the house of bondage. You shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and serve Him only, and cleave to Him, and <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by His name. You shall not go after strange gods, and the gods of the nations which are round about you, because the Lord your God is also a jealous God among you, and lest His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> should be kindled against you, and destroy you from off the face of the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038233"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:12</a></span> But setting before them blessings and curses, He also says: <q>Blessings shall be yours, if you <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the commandments of the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whatsoever I command you this day, and do not wander from the way which I have commanded you, to go and serve other gods whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038234"><a href="../bible/deu011.htm#verse27">Deuteronomy&nbsp;11:27</a></span> And as to rooting them out in every way: <q>You shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, which you shall possess by inheritance, served their gods, upon mountains and hills, and under shady trees. You shall overthrow all their altars, you shall overturn and break in pieces their pillars, and cut down their groves, and burn with fire the graven images of the gods themselves, and destroy the names of them out of that place.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038235"><a href="../bible/deu012.htm#verse2">Deuteronomy&nbsp;12:2-3</a></span> He further urges, when they (the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>) had entered the land of promise, and driven out its nations: <q>Take heed to your self, that you do not follow them after they be driven out from before you, that you do not inquire after their gods, saying, As the nations serve their gods, so let me do likewise.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038236"><a href="../bible/deu012.htm#verse30">Deuteronomy&nbsp;12:30</a></span> But also says He: <q>If there arise among you a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> himself, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder, and it come to pass, and he say, Let us go and serve other gods, whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, do not hearken to the words of that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> or dreamer, for the Lord your God proves you, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether you <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God with all your heart and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. After the Lord your God you shall go, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him, and keep His commandments, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> His voice, and serve Him, and cleave unto Him. But that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> or dreamer shall die; for he has spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038237"><a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy&nbsp;13:1</a></span> But also in another section,  <q>If, however, your brother, the son of your father or of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend who is as your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, solicit you, saying secretly, Let us go and serve other gods, which you know not, nor did your fathers, of the gods of the nations which are round about you, very near unto you or far off from you, do not consent to go with him, and do not hearken to him. Your eye shall not spare him, neither shall you pity, neither shall you preserve him; you shall certainly inform upon him. Your hand shall be first upon him to kill him, and afterwards the hand of your people; and you shall stone him, and he shall die, seeing he has sought to turn you away from the Lord your God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038239"><a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy&nbsp;13:6</a></span> He adds likewise concerning cities, that if it appeared that one of these had, through the advice of unrighteous men, passed over to other gods, all its inhabitants should be slain, and everything belonging to it become accursed, and all the spoil of it be gathered together into all its places of egress, and be, even with all the people, burned with fire in all its streets in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>; and, says He, <q>it shall not be for dwelling in for ever: it shall not be built again any more, and there shall cleave to your hands nought of its accursed plunder, that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038240"><a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse16">Deuteronomy&nbsp;13:16</a></span> He has, from His abhorrence of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, framed a series of curses too: <q>Cursed be the man who makes a graven or a molten image, an abomination, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and puts it in a secret place.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038241"><a href="../bible/deu027.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy&nbsp;27:15</a></span> But in Leviticus He says: <q>Go not after <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the Lord your God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038242"><a href="../bible/rev019.htm#verse4">Revelation&nbsp;19:4</a></span> And in other passages: <q>The children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> are my household servants; these are they whom I led forth from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>:  I am the Lord your God. You shall not make you <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> fashioned by the hand, neither rear you up a graven image. Nor shall you set up a remarkable stone in your land (to worship it): I am the Lord your God.</q>  These words indeed were first spoken by the Lord by the lips of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, being applicable certainly to whomsoever the Lord God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> may lead forth in like manner from the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> of a most superstitious world, and from the abode of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> slavery. But from the mouth of every <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in succession, sound forth also utterances of the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, augmenting the same law of His by a renewal of the same commands, and in the first place announcing no other duty in so special a manner as the being on guard against all making and worshipping of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; as when by the mouth of David He says: <q>The gods of the nations are silver and gold: they have eyes, and see not; they have ears, and hear not; they have a nose, and smell not; a mouth, and they speak not; hands, and they handle not; feet and they walk not. Like to them shall be they who make them, and trust in them.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>Nor should I think it needful to discuss whether God pursues a worthy course in forbidding His own name and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to be given over to a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, or does so in not consenting that such as He has plucked from the maze of false religion should return again to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, or does so in not suffering to depart from Him them whom He has chosen for Himself. Thus that, too, will not require to be treated by us, whether He has wished to be kept the rule which He has chosen to appoint, and whether He <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> avenges the abandonment of the rule which He has wished to be kept; since He would have appointed it to no purpose if He had not wished it kept, and would have to no purpose wished it kept if He had been unwilling to uphold it. My next step, indeed, is to put to the test these appointments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in opposition to false <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a>, the completely vanquished as well as also the punished, since on these will depend the entire argument for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was apart with God on the mountain, when the people, not brooking his absence, which was so needful, seek to make gods for themselves, which, for his own part, he will prefer to destroy. <span class="stiki" id="note038246"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm">Exodus&nbsp;xxxii</a></span> <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> is importuned, and commands that the earrings of their <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> be brought together, that they may be thrown into the fire. For the people were about to lose, as a judgment upon themselves, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> ornaments for the ears, the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The wise fire makes for them the molten likeness of a calf, reproaching them with having the heart where they have their treasure also&mdash;in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to wit, which clothed with sacredness, among the other animals, a certain ox likewise. Therefore the slaughter of three thousand by their nearest <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>, because they had displeased their so very near relative <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, solemnly marked both the commencement and the deserts of the trespass. <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> having, as we are told in Numbers, <span class="stiki" id="note038247"><a href="../bible/num025.htm#verse1">Numbers&nbsp;25:1</a></span> turned aside at Sethim, the people go to the daughters of Moab to gratify their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>: they are allured to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, so that they committed whoredom with the spirit also: finally, they eat of their defiled <em><a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a></em>; then they both worship the gods of the nation, and are admitted to the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of Beelphegor. For this lapse, too, into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, sister to <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, it took the slaughter of twenty-three thousand by the swords of their countrymen to appease the divine <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. After the death of Joshua the son of Nave they forsake the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of their fathers, and serve <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, Baalim and Ashtaroth; <span class="stiki" id="note038248"><a href="../bible/jdg002.htm#verse8">Judges&nbsp;2:8-13</a></span> and the Lord in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> delivered them up to the hands of spoilers, and they continued to be spoiled by them, and to be sold to their adversaries, and could not at all stand before their enemies. Whithersoever they went forth, His hand was upon them for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and they were greatly distressed. And after this God sets judges (<em>critas</em>), the same as our censors, over them. But not even these did they continue steadfastly to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>. So soon as one of the judges died, they proceeded to transgress more than their fathers had done by going after the gods of others, and serving and worshipping them. Therefore the Lord was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. <q>Since, indeed,</q> He says, <q>this nation have transgressed my covenant which I established with their fathers, and have not hearkened to my voice, I also will give no heed to remove from before them a man of the nations which Joshua left at his death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038249"><a href="../bible/jdg002.htm#verse20">Judges&nbsp;2:20-21</a></span> And thus, throughout almost all the annals of the judges and of the kings who succeeded them, while the strength of the surrounding nations was preserved, He meted <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> out to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and captivity and a foreign yoke, as often as they turned aside from Him, especially to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>If, therefore, it is evident that from the beginning this kind of worship has both been forbidden&mdash; <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> the commands so numerous and weighty&mdash; and that it has never been engaged in without punishment following, as examples so numerous and impressive show, and that no offense is counted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so presumptuous as a trespass of this sort, we ought further to perceive the purport of both the divine threatenings and their fulfilments, which was even then commended not only by the not calling in question, but also by the enduring of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>, for which certainly He had given occasion by forbidding <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. For otherwise <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> would not take place. And certainly He had supplied, as a warrant for these, His own authority, willing those events to come to pass for the occurrence of which He had given occasion. At present (it is important), for we are getting severely stung concerning the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the scorpion repeats the prick, denying the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of this will, finding fault with it, so that he either insinuates that there is another god, such that this is not his will, or none the less overthrows ours, seeing such is his will, or altogether denies <em>this</em> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if he cannot deny Himself. But, for our part, contending elsewhere about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and about all the rest of the body of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teaching, we now draw before us definite lines  for one form of encounter, maintaining that this will, such as to have given occasion for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>, is that of not another god than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, on the ground of the commandments relating to an always forbidden, as well as of the judgments upon a punished, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. For if the keeping of a command involves the suffering of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, this will be, so to speak, a command about keeping the command, requiring me to suffer that through which I shall be able to keep the command, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> namely, whatever of it threatens me when on my guard against <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. And certainly (in the case supposed) the Author of the command extorts compliance with it. He could not, therefore, have been unwilling that those events should come to pass by means of which the compliance will be manifest. The injunction is given me not to make mention of any other god, not even by speaking&mdash;as little by the tongue as by the hand&mdash;to fashion a god, and not to worship or in any way show reverence to another than Him only who thus commands me, whom I am both bid <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that I may not be forsaken by Him, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with my whole being, that I may die for Him. Serving as a soldier under this <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, I am challenged by the enemy. If I surrender to them, I am as they are. In maintaining this <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, I fight furiously in battle, am wounded, hewn in pieces, slain. Who wished this fatal issue to his soldier, but he who sealed him by such an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>You have therefore the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of my God. We have cured this prick. Let us give good heed to another thrust touching the character of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. It would be tedious to show that my God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>&mdash;a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with which the Marcionites have now been made acquainted by us. Meanwhile it is enough that He is called God for its being necessary that He should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be good. For if any one make the supposition that God is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he will not be able to take his stand on both the constituents thereof: he will be bound either to affirm that he whom he has thought to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that he whom he has proclaimed to be God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Good, therefore, will be the will also of him who, unless he is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, will not be God. The goodness of the thing itself also which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has willed&mdash; of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, I mean&mdash; will show this, because only one who is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> has willed what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. I stoutly maintain that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as required by the God by whom likewise <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is forbidden and punished. For <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> strives against and opposes <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. But to strive against and oppose <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cannot be ought but good. Not as if I denied that there is a rivalry in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things with one another, as well as in good also; but this ground for it requires a different state of matters. For <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> contends with <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, not from some <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> which they share, but from its own kindness; for it delivers from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Who will not proclaim that to be good which delivers from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>? What else is the opposition between <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, than that between life and death? Life will be counted to be <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> as much as <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> to be death. He who will call life an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, has death to speak of as a good. This frowardness also appertains to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>&mdash;to discard what is wholesome, to accept what is baleful, to avoid all dangerous cures, or, in short, to be eager to die rather than to be healed. For they are many who flee from the aid of physic also, many in folly, many from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and false modesty. And the healing art has manifestly an apparent cruelty, by reason of the lancet, and of the burning iron, and of the great heat of the mustard; yet to be cut and burned, and pulled and bitten, is not on that account an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for it occasions helpful pains; nor will it be refused merely because it afflicts, but because it afflicts inevitably will it be applied. The good accruing is the apology for the frightfulness of the work. In short, that man who is howling and groaning and bellowing in the hands of a physician will presently load the same hands with a fee, and proclaim that they are the best operators, and no longer affirm that they are cruel. Thus <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> also rage furiously, but for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. God also will be at liberty to heal for everlasting life by means of fires and swords, and all that is painful. But you will admire the physician at least even in that respect, that for the most part he employs like properties in the cures to counteract the properties of the diseases, when he aids, as it were, the wrong way, succouring by means of those things to which the affliction is owing. For he both checks heat by heat, by laying on a greater load; and subdues inflammation by leaving thirst unappeased, by tormenting rather; and contracts the superabundance of bile by every bitter little draught, and stops hemorrhage by opening a veinlet in addition. But you will think that God must be found fault with, and that for being jealous, if He has chosen to contend with a disease and to do good by imitating the malady, to destroy death by death, to dissipate killing by killing, to dispel tortures by tortures, to disperse  punishments by punishments, to bestow life by withdrawing it, to aid the flesh by injuring it, to preserve the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by snatching it away. The wrongheadedness, as you deem it to be, is reasonableness; what you count cruelty is kindness. Thus, seeing God by brief (sufferings) effects cures for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, extol your God for your prosperity; you have fallen into His hands, but have happily fallen. He also fell into your sicknesses. Man always first provides employment for the physician; in short, he has brought upon himself the danger of death. He had received from his own Lord, as from a physician, the salutary enough rule to live according to the law, that he should eat of all indeed (that the garden produced) and should refrain from only one little tree which in the meantime the Physician Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> as a perilous one. He gave ear to him whom he preferred, and broke through self-restraint. He ate what was forbidden, and, surfeited by the trespass, suffered indigestion tending to death; he certainly richly deserving to lose his life altogether who wished to do so. But the inflamed tumour due to the trespass having been endured until in due time the medicine might be mixed, the Lord gradually prepared the means of healing&mdash; all the rules of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they also bearing a resemblance to (the causes of) the ailment, seeing they annul the word of death by the word of life, and diminish the trespass-listening by a listening of allegiance. Thus, even when that Physician commands one to die, He drives out the lethargy of death. Why does man show reluctance to suffer now from a cure, what he was not reluctant then to suffer from a disorder? Does he dislike being killed for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, who did not dislike being killed for destruction?&mdash; Will he feel squeamish with reference to the counter poison, who gaped for the poison?</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>But if, for the contest's sake, God had appointed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> for us, that thereby we might make trial with our opponent, in order that He may now keep bruising him by whom man chose to be bruised, here too generosity rather than harshness in God holds sway. For He wished to make man, now plucked from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> throat by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, trample upon him likewise by <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, that he might not merely have escaped from, but also completely vanquished, his enemy. He who had called to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> has been pleased to summon to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> also, that they who were rejoicing in consequence of their deliverance may be in transports when they are crowned likewise. With what good-will the world celebrates those games, the combative festivals and superstitious contests of the Greeks, involving forms both of worship and of pleasure, has now become clear in Africa also. As yet cities, by sending their congratulations severally, annoy <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, which was presented with the Pythian game after the racecourse had attained to an old age. Thus, by the world  it has been <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be a most proper mode of testing proficiency in studies, to put in competition the forms of skill, to elicit the existing condition of bodies and of voices, the reward being the informer, the public exhibition the judge, and pleasure the decision. Where there are mere contests, there are some wounds: fists make reel, heels kick like butting rams, boxing-gloves mangle, whips leave gashes. Yet there will be no one reproaching the superintendent of the contest for exposing men to outrage. Suits for injuries lie outside the racecourse. But to the extent that those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> deal in discoloration, and gore, and swellings, he will design for them crowns, doubtless, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and a present, political privileges, contributions by the citizens, images, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, and&mdash; of such sort as the world can give&mdash; an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of fame, a resurrection by being kept in remembrance. The pugilist himself does not complain of feeling pain, for he wishes it; the crown closes the wounds, the palm hides the blood: he is excited more by victory than by injury. Will you count this man hurt whom you see <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>? But not even the vanquished himself will reproach the superintendent of the contest for his misfortune. Shall it be unbecoming in God to bring forth kinds of skill and rules of His own into public view, into this open ground of the world, to be seen by men, and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and all powers?&mdash; to test flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> as to steadfastness and endurance?&mdash; to give to this one the palm, to this one distinction, to that one the privilege of citizenship, to that one pay?&mdash; to reject some also, and after punishing to remove them with disgrace? You dictate to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, forsooth, the times, or the ways, or the places in which to institute a trial concerning His own troop (of competitors) as if it were not proper for the Judge to pronounce the preliminary decision also. Well now, if He had put forth <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to suffer <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> not for the contest's sake, but for its own benefit, ought it not to have had some store of hope, for the increase of which it might restrain desire of its own, and check its wish in order that it might strive to mount up, seeing they also who discharge earthly functions are eager for promotion? Or how will there be many mansions in our Father's house, if not to accord with a diversity of deserts? How will one star also differ from another star in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, unless in virtue of disparity in their rays? <span class="stiki" id="note038253"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse41">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:41</a></span> But further, if, on that account, some increase of brightness also was appropriate to loftiness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that gain ought to have been of some such sort as would cost great effort, poignant suffering, torture, death. But consider the requital, when flesh and life are paid away&mdash; than which in man there is nought more precious, the one from the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other from His breath&mdash; that the very things are paid away in obtaining the benefit of which the benefit consists; that the very things are expended which may be acquired; that the same things are the price which are also the commodities. God had foreseen also other weaknesses incident to the condition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>&mdash;the stratagems of the enemy, the deceptive aspects of the creatures, the snares of the world; that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, even after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, would be endangered; that the most, after attaining unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, would be lost again, through soiling the wedding-dress, through failing to provide oil for their torchlets&mdash; would be such as would have to be sought for over mountains and woodlands, and carried back upon the shoulders. He therefore appointed as second supplies of comfort, and the last means of succour, the fight of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>&mdash; thereafter free from danger&mdash; of blood. And concerning the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the man who has partaken of these, David says: <q>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q>  For, strictly speaking, there cannot any longer be reckoned ought against the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, by whom in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (of blood) life itself is laid down. Thus, <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> covers the multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038255"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:8</a></span> and loving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to wit, with all its strength (by which in the endurance of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> it maintains the fight), with all its life <span class="stiki" id="note038256"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;22:37</a></span> (which it lays down for God), it makes of man a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. Shall you call these cures, counsels, methods of judging, spectacles, (illustrations of) even the barbarity of God? Does God <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> man's blood? And yet I might venture to affirm that He does, if man also <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covets</a> the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, if man <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covets</a> a sure <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, if man also <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covets</a> a second new birth. The exchange is displeasing to no one, which can plead, in justification of itself, that either benefit or injury is shared by the parties making it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>If the scorpion, swinging his tail in the air, still reproach us with having a murderer for our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I shall shudder at the altogether foul breath of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> which comes stinking from his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> mouth; but I will embrace even such a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with assurance derived from reason, by which reason even He Himself has, in the person of His own Wisdom, by the lips of Solomon, proclaimed Himself to be more than a murderer: Wisdom (<em>Sophia</em>), says He has slain her own children.  <em>Sophia</em> is Wisdom. She has certainly slain them wisely if only into life, and reasonably if only into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> by a parent, oh the clever form! Oh the dexterity of crime! Oh the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of cruelty, which has slain for this reason, that he whom it may have slain may not die! And therefore what follows? Wisdom is praised in <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, in the places of egress; for the death of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> also is praised in song. Wisdom behaves with firmness in the streets, for with good results does she <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> her own sons.  Nay, on the top of the walls she speaks with assurance, when indeed, according to Esaias, this one calls out, <q>I am God's;</q> and this one shouts, <q>In the name of Jacob;</q> and another writes, <q>In the name of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038259"><a href="../bible/isa044.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;44:5</a></span> O good mother! I myself also wish to be put among the number of her sons, that I may be slain by her; I wish to be slain, that I may become a son. But does she merely <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> her sons, or also torture them? For I hear God also, in another passage, say, <q>I will burn them as gold is burned, and will try them as silver is tried.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038260"><a href="../bible/zec013.htm#verse9">Zechariah&nbsp;13:9</a></span> Certainly by the means of torture which fires and punishments supply, by the testing <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The apostle also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what kind of God he has ascribed to us, when he writes: <q>If God spared not His own Son, but gave Him up for us, how did He not with Him also give us all things?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038261"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;8:32</a></span> You see how divine Wisdom has murdered even her own proper, <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> and only Son, who is certainly about to live, nay, to bring back the others also into life. I can say with the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; It is Christ who gave Himself up for our offenses. <span class="stiki" id="note038262"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;4:25</a></span> Already has Wisdom butchered herself also. The character of words depends not on the sound only, but on the meaning also, and they must be heard not merely by ears, but also by minds. He who does not understand, believes God to be cruel; although for him also who does not understand, an announcement has been made to restrain his harshness in understanding otherwise <em>than aright</em>. <q>For who,</q> says <em>the apostle</em>, <q>has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counsellor, to teach Him? Or who has pointed out to Him the way of understanding?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038263"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse34">Romans&nbsp;11:34</a></span> But, indeed, the world has held it lawful for Diana of the Scythians, or Mercury of the Gauls, or Saturn of the Africans, to be appeased by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; and in Latium to this day Jupiter has <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> blood given him to taste in the midst of the city; and no one makes it a matter of discussion, or imagines that it does not occur for some reason, or that it occurs by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without having value. If our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, too, to have a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of His own, had required <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> for Himself, who would have reproached Him for the deadly religion, and the mournful ceremonies, and the altar-pyre, and the undertaker-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and not rather have counted <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> the man whom God should have devoured?</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>We keep therefore the one position, and, in respect of this question only, summon to an encounter, whether <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> have been commanded by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they have been commanded by reason, if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they have been commanded by Him, because God will not command ought without reason. Since the death of His own <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is precious is His sight, as David sings,  it is not, I think, that one which falls to the lot of men generally, and is a debt due by all (rather is that one even disgraceful on account of the trespass, and the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of condemnation <em>to which it is to be traced</em>), but that <em>other</em> which is met in this very work&mdash; in bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> for religion, and maintaining the fight of confession in behalf of righteousness and the sacrament. As says Esaias, <q>See how the righteous man perishes, and no one lays it to heart; and righteous men are taken away, and no one considers it: for from before the face of unrighteousness the righteous man perishes, and he shall have <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> at his burial.</q>  Here, too, you have both an announcement of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>, and <em>of</em> the recompense they bring. From the beginning, indeed, righteousness suffers <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Forthwith, as soon as God has begun to be worshipped, religion has got ill-will for her portion. He who had pleased God is slain, and that by his brother. Beginning with kindred blood, in order that it might the more easily go in quest of that of strangers, ungodliness made the object of its pursuit, finally, that not only of righteous <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but even of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> also. David is <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>; Elias put to flight; Jeremias <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>; Esaias cut asunder; Zacharias butchered between the altar and the temple, imparting to the hard stones lasting marks of his blood. <span class="stiki" id="note038266"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;14:3</a></span> That person himself, at the close of the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and called not a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, but a messenger, is, suffering an ignominious death, beheaded to reward a dancing-girl. And certainly they who were wont to be led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> used to be guided by Himself to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>; so that they had even already to endure what they had also proclaimed as requiring to be borne. Wherefore the brotherhood of the three also, when the dedication of the royal image was the occasion of the citizens being pressed to offer worship, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> well what <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which alone in them had not been taken captive, required&mdash;namely, that they must resist <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> to the death. <span class="stiki" id="note038267"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse12">Daniel&nbsp;3:12</a></span> For they remembered also the words of Jeremias writing to those over whom that captivity was impending: <q>And now you shall see borne upon (men's) shoulders the gods of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a>, of gold and silver and wood, causing <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Beware, therefore, that you also do not be altogether like the foreigners, and be seized with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> while you behold crowds worshipping those gods before and behind, but say in your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, Our duty is to worship You, O Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038268"><a href="../bible/bar006.htm#verse3">Baruch&nbsp;6:3</a></span> Therefore, having got confidence from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they said, when with strength of mind they set at defiance the king's threats against the disobedient: <q>There is no necessity for our making answer to this command of yours. For our God whom we worship is able to deliver us from the furnace of fire and from your hands; and then it will be made plain to you that we shall neither serve your idol, nor worship your golden image which you have set up.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038269"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse16">Daniel&nbsp;3:16</a></span> O <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> even without suffering perfect! Enough did they suffer! enough were they burned, whom on this account God shielded, that it might not seem that they had given a false representation of His power. For immediately, certainly, would the lions, with their pent-up and wonted savageness, have devoured Daniel also, a worshipper of none but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore accused and demanded by the Chaldeans, if it had been right that the worthy anticipation of Darius concerning God should have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> delusive. For the rest, every preacher of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and every worshipper also, such as, having been summoned to the service of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, had refused compliance, ought to have suffered, agreeably to the tenor of that argument too, by which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> ought to have been recommended both to those who were then living and to those following in succession,&mdash; (namely), that the suffering of its defenders themselves bespeak trust for it, because nobody would have been willing to be slain but one possessing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Such commands as well as instances, remounting to earliest times, show that <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> are under obligation to suffer <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>It remains for us, lest ancient times may perhaps have had the sacrament  (exclusively) their own, to review the modern <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> system, as though, being also from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it might be different <em>from what preceded</em>, and besides, therefore, opposed thereto in its code of rules likewise, so that its Wisdom <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> her own sons! Evidently, in the case of Christ both the divine nature and the will and the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> are different <em>from any previously <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a></em>! He will have commanded either no <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> at all, or those which must be understood in a sense different from the ordinary, being such a person as to urge no one to a risk of this kind as to promise no reward to them who suffer for Him, because He does not wish them to suffer; and therefore does He say, when setting forth His chief commands, <q>Blessed are they who are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q>  The following statement, indeed, applies <em>first</em> to all without restriction, then specially to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves: <q>Blessed shall you be when men shall revile you, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you, and shall say all manner of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against you, for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, since very great is your reward in heaven; for so used their fathers to do even to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> So that He likewise foretold their having to be themselves also slain, after the example of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Though, even if He had appointed all this <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in case He were <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> for those only who were then <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, assuredly through them along with the entire sacrament, with the shoot of the name, with the layer of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the rule about enduring <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> also would have had respect to us too, as to <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> by inheritance, and, (as it were,) bushes from the apostolic seed. For even thus again does He address words of guidance to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: <q>Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves;</q> and, <q>Beware of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>; and you shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,</q> etc. <span class="stiki" id="note038272"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;10:16</a></span> Now when He adds, <q>But the brother will deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child; and the children shall rise up against their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>,</q> He has clearly announced with reference to the others, (that they would be subjected to) this form of unrighteous conduct, which we do not find <em>exemplified</em> in the case of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For none of them had experience of a father or a brother as a betrayer, which very many of us have. Then He returns to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: <q>And you shall be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for my name's sake.</q> How much more shall we, for whom there exists the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of being delivered up by <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> too! Thus, by allotting this very betrayal, now to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, now to all, He pours out the same destruction upon all the possessors of the name, on whom the name, along with the condition that it be an object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, will rest. But he who will endure on to the end&mdash; this man will be saved. By enduring what but <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>&mdash;betrayal&mdash;death? For to endure to the end is nought else than to suffer the end. And therefore there immediately follow, <q>The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> is not above his master, nor the servant above his own lord;</q> because, seeing the Master and Lord Himself was steadfast in suffering <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, betrayal and death, much more will it be the duty of His servants and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to bear the same, that they may not seem as if superior to Him, or to have got an immunity from the assaults of unrighteousness, since this itself should be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> enough for them, to be conformed to the sufferings of their Lord and Master; and, preparing them for the endurance of these, He reminds them that they must not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as kill the body only, but are not able to destroy the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but that they must dedicate <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to Him rather who has such power that He can kill both body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and destroy them in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Who, pray, are these slayers of the body only, but the governors and kings aforesaid&mdash; men, I suppose? Who is the ruler of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only? Who is this but the threatener of fires <em>hereafter</em>, He without whose will not even one of two sparrows falls to the ground; that is, not even one of the two substances of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, flesh or spirit, because the number of our hairs also has been recorded before Him? Fear not, therefore. When He adds, <q>You are of more value than many sparrows,</q> He makes promise that we shall not in vain&mdash; that is, not without profit&mdash; fall to the ground if we choose to be killed by men rather than by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>Whosoever therefore will confess in me before men, in him will I confess also before my Father who is in heaven;  and whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I deny also before my Father who is in heaven.</q> Clear, as I think, are the terms used in announcing, and the way to explain, the confession as well as the denial, although the mode of putting them is different. He who confesses himself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that he is Christ's; he who is Christ's must be in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. If he is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he certainly confesses in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when he confesses himself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. For he cannot be this without being in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Besides, by confessing in Christ he confesses Christ too: since, by virtue of being a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, he is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while <em>Christ</em> Himself also is in him. For if you have made mention of day, you have also held out to view the element of light which gives us day, although you may not have made mention of light. Thus, albeit He has not expressly said, <q>He who will confess me,</q> (yet) the conduct involved in daily confession is not different from what is meant in our Lord's declaration. For he who confesses himself to be what he is, that is, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, confesses that likewise by which he is it, that is, Christ. Therefore he who has denied that he is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, has denied in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by denying that he is in Christ while he denies that he is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; and, on the other hand, by denying that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is in him, while He denies that he is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he will deny Christ too. Thus both he who will deny in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, will deny Christ, and he who will confess in Christ will confess Christ. It would have been enough, therefore, though our Lord had made an announcement about confessing merely. For, from His mode of presenting confession, it might be decided beforehand with reference to its opposite too&mdash; denial, that is&mdash; that denial is repaid by the Lord with denial, just as confession is with confession. And therefore, since in the mould in which the confession has been cast the state of (the case with reference to) denial also may be perceived, it is evident that to another manner of denial belongs what the Lord has announced concerning it, in terms different from those in which He speaks of confession, when He says, <q>Who will deny me,</q> not <q>Who will deny in me.</q> For He had foreseen that this form of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> also would, for the most part, immediately follow when any one had been forced to renounce the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name&mdash;that he who had denied that he was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> would be compelled to deny Christ Himself too by <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> Him. As not long ago, alas, we shuddered at the struggle waged in this way by some with their entire <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which had had favourable omens. Therefore it will be to no purpose to say, <q>Though I shall deny that I am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, I shall not be denied by Christ, for I have not denied Himself.</q> For even so much will be inferred from that denial, by which, seeing he denies Christ in him by denying that he is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, he has denied <em>Christ</em> Himself also. But there is more, because He threatens likewise shame with shame (in return): <q>Whosoever shall be ashamed of me before men, of him will I also be ashamed before my Father who is in heaven.</q> For He was aware that denial is produced even most of all by shame, that the state of the mind appears in the forehead, and that the wound of shame precedes that in the body.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>But as to those who think that not here, that is, not within this environment of earth, nor during this period of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, nor before men possessing this nature shared by us all, has confession been appointed to be made, what a supposition is theirs, being at variance with the whole order of things of which we have experience in these lands, and in this life, and under <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> authorities! Doubtless, when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> have departed from their bodies, and begun to be put upon trial in the several stories of the heavens, with reference to the engagement (under which they have come to Jesus), and to be questioned about those hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, they must then confess before the real powers and the real men,&mdash; the Teleti,  to wit, and the Abascanti,  and the Acineti  of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>! For, say <em>they</em>, even the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a> himself did not uniformly approve of the men of our world, whom he counted as a drop of a bucket, <span class="stiki" id="note038277"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;40:15</a></span> and the dust of the threshing-floor, and spittle and locusts, <em>and</em> put on a level even with brute beasts. Clearly, it is so written. Yet not therefore must we understand that there is, besides us, another kind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which&mdash; for it is evidently <em>thus</em> (in the case proposed)&mdash; has been able to assume without invalidating a comparison <em>between the two kinds</em>, both the characteristics of the race and a unique property. For even if the life was tainted, so that condemned to contempt it might be likened to objects held in contempt, the nature was not immediately taken away, so that there might be supposed to be another under its name. Rather is the nature preserved, though the life blushes; nor does Christ <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> other men than those with reference to whom He says, <q>Whom do men say that I am?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038278"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;16:13</a></span> And, <q>As you would that men should do to you, do likewise so to them.</q>  Consider whether He may not have preserved a race such that He is looking for a testimony to Himself from them, as well as consisting of those on whom He enjoins the interchange of righteous dealing. But if I should urgently demand that those heavenly men be described to me, Aratus will sketch more easily Perseus and Cepheus, and Erigone, and Ariadne, among the constellations. But who prevented the Lord from clearly prescribing that confession by men likewise has to be made where He plainly announced that His own would be; so that the statement might have run thus: Whosoever shall confess in me before men in heaven, I also will confess in him before my Father who is in heaven? He ought to have saved me from this mistake about confession on earth, which He would not have wished me to take part in, if He had commanded one in heaven; for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no other men but the inhabitants of the earth, man himself even not having up to that time been observed in heaven. Besides, what is the credibility of the things (alleged), that, being after death raised to heavenly places, I should be put to the test there, whither I would not be translated without being already tested, that I should there be tried in reference to a command where I could not come, but to find admittance? <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> lies open to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> before the way to it does; because there is no way to heaven, but to him to whom heaven lies open; and he who reaches it will enter. What powers, keeping guard at the gate, do I hear you affirm to exist in accordance with Roman <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, with a certain Carnus, Forculus, and Limentinus? What powers do you set in order at the railings? If you have ever read in David, <q>Lift up your gates, you princes, and let the everlasting gates be lifted up; and the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall enter in;</q>  if you have also heard from Amos, <q>Who builds up to the heavens his way of ascent, and is such as to pour forth his abundance (of waters) over the earth;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038281"><a href="../bible/amo009.htm#verse6">Amos&nbsp;9:6</a></span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that both that way of ascent was thereafter levelled with the ground, by the footsteps of the Lord, and an entrance thereafter opened up by the might of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and that no delay or inquest will meet <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> on the threshold, since they have there to be not discriminated from one another, but owned, and not put to the question, but received in. For though you think heaven still shut, remember that the Lord left here to Peter and through him to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the keys of it, which every one who has been here put to the question, and also made confession, will carry with him. But the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> stoutly affirms that we must confess there, to persuade us that we must deny here. I shall send before me fine documents, to be sure,  I shall carry with me excellent keys, the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of them who kill the body only, but do nought against the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: I shall be graced by the neglect of this command: I shall stand with credit in heavenly places, who could not stand in earthly: I shall hold out against the greater powers, who yielded to the lesser: I shall deserve to be at length let in, though now shut out. It readily occurs to one to remark further, <q>If it is in heaven that men must confess, it is here too that they must deny.</q> For where the one is, there both are. For contraries always go together. There will need to be carried on in heaven <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> even, which is the occasion of confession or denial. Why, then, do you refrain, O most presumptuous <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, from transporting to the world above the whole series of means proper to the intimidation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and especially to put there the very <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for the name, where Christ rules at the right hand of the Father? Will you plant there both <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>&mdash; fountains of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>&mdash; before which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> endured the scourge, and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> assemblages with their own circus, forsooth, where they readily join in the cry, Death to the third race?  But you are bound to produce  in the same place both our brothers, fathers, children, mothers-in-law, daughters-in-law and those of our household, through whose agency the betrayal has been appointed; likewise kings, governors, and armed authorities, before whom the matter at issue must be contested. Assuredly there will be in heaven a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> also, destitute of the sun's rays or full of light unthankfully, and fetters of the zones perhaps, and, for a rack-horse, the axis itself which whirls <em>the heavens round</em>. Then, if a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is to be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, hail-storms will be near; if burned, thunderbolts are at hand; if butchered, the armed Orion will exercise his function; if put an end to by beasts, the north will send forth the bears, the Zodiac the bulls and the lions. He who will endure these assaults to the end, the same shall be saved. Will there be then, in heaven, both an end, and suffering, a killing, and the first confession? And where will be the flesh requisite for all this? Where the body which alone has to be killed by men? Unerring reason has commanded us to set forth these things in even a playful manner; nor will any one thrust out the bar consisting in this objection (we have offered), so as not to be compelled to transfer the whole array of means proper to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, all the powerful instrumentality which has been provided for dealing with this matter, to the place where he has put the court before which confession should be made. Since confession is elicited by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> ended in confession, there cannot but be at the same time, in attendance upon these, the instrumentality which determines both the entrance and the exit, that is, the beginning and the end. But both <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for the name will be here, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> breaks out here, betrayal brings men forth here, examination uses force here, torture rages here, and confession or denial completes this whole course of procedure on the earth. Therefore, if the other things are here, confession also is not elsewhere; if confession is elsewhere, the other things also are not here. Certainly the other things are not elsewhere; therefore neither is confession in heaven. Or, if they will have it that the manner in which the heavenly examination and confession take place is different, it will certainly be also incumbent on them to devise a mode of procedure of their own of a very different kind, and opposed to that method which is indicated in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. And we may be able to say, Let them consider (whether what they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> to exist does so), if so be that this course of procedure, proper to examination and confession on earth&mdash; a course which has <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> as the source in which it originates, and which pleads dissension in the state&mdash; is preserved to its own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if so be that we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> just as is also written, and understand just as is spoken. Here I endure the entire course (in question), the Lord Himself not appointing a different quarter of the world <em>for my doing so</em>. For what does He add after finishing with confession and denial? <q>Think not that I have come to send peace on earth, but a sword,</q>&mdash; undoubtedly on the earth. <q>For I have come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038284"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;10:34</a></span> For so is it brought to pass, that the brother delivers up the brother to death, and the father the son: and the children rise up against the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to die. And he who endures to the end let that man be saved. <span class="stiki" id="note038285"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;10:21</a></span> So that this whole course of procedure characteristic of the Lord's sword, which has been sent not to heaven, but to earth, makes confession also to be there, which by enduring to the end is to issue in the suffering of death.</p>

<p>In the same manner, therefore, we maintain that the other announcements too refer to the condition of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. <q>He,</q> says Jesus, <q>who will value his own life also more than me, is not worthy of me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038286"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;14:26</a></span> &mdash; that is, he who will rather live by denying, than die by confessing, me; and <q>he who finds his life shall lose it; but he who loses it for my sake shall find it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038287"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;10:39</a></span> Therefore indeed he finds it, who, in winning life, denies; but he who thinks that he wins it by denying, will lose it in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. On the other hand, he who, through confessing, is killed, will lose it for the present, but is also about to find it unto everlasting life. In fine, governors themselves, when they urge men to deny, say, <q>Save your life;</q> and, <q>Do not lose your life.</q> How would Christ speak, but in accordance with the treatment to which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> would be subjected? But when He forbids thinking about what answer to make at a judgment-seat, <span class="stiki" id="note038288"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;10:19</a></span> He is preparing His own servants <em>for what awaited them</em>, He gives the assurance that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> will answer <em>by them</em>; and when He wishes a brother to be visited in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note038289"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse36">Matthew&nbsp;25:36</a></span> He is commanding that those about to confess be the object of solicitude; and He is soothing their sufferings when He asserts that God will avenge His own elect. <span class="stiki" id="note038290"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;18:7</a></span> In the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> also of the withering of the word <span class="stiki" id="note038291"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;13:3</a></span> after the green blade had sprung up, He is drawing a picture with reference to the burning heat of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>. If these announcements are not understood as they are made, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> they signify something else than the sound indicates; and there will be one thing in the words, another in their meanings, as is the case with allegories, with <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, with riddles. Whatever wind of reasoning, therefore, these scorpions may catch (in their sails), with whatever subtlety they may attack, there is now one line of defence:  an appeal will be made to the facts themselves, whether they occur as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> represent that they would; since another thing will then be meant in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> if that very one (which seems to be so) is not found in actual facts. For what is written, must needs come to pass. Besides, what is written will then come to pass, if something different does not. But, lo! We are both regarded as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for the sake of the name, as it is written; and are delivered up by our nearest of kin also, as it is written; and are brought before magistrates, and examined, and tortured, and make confession, and are ruthlessly killed, as it is written. So the Lord ordained. If He ordained these events otherwise, why do they not come to pass otherwise than He ordained them, that is, as He ordained them? And yet they do not come to pass otherwise than He ordained. Therefore, as they come to pass, so He ordained; and as He ordained, so they come to pass. For neither would they have been permitted to occur otherwise than He ordained, nor for His part would He have ordained otherwise than He would wish them to occur. Thus these passages of Scripture will not mean ought else than we recognise in actual facts; or if those events are not yet taking place which are announced, how are those taking place which have not been announced? For these events which are taking place have not been announced, if those which are announced are different, and not these which are taking place. Well now, seeing the very occurrences are met with in actual life which are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have been expressed with a different meaning in words, what would happen if they were found to have come to pass in a different manner <em>than had been revealed</em>? But this will be the waywardness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what has been demonstrated, to assume the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of what has not been demonstrated. And to this waywardness I will offer the following objection also, that if these events, which occur as is written, will not be the very ones which are announced, those too (which are meant) ought not to occur as is written, that they themselves also may not, after the example of these <em>others</em>, be in danger of exclusion, since there is one thing in the words and another in the facts; and there remains that even the events which have been announced are not seen when they occur, if they are announced otherwise than they have to occur. And how will those be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> (to have come to pass), which will not have been announced as they come to pass? Thus <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, by not believing what is announced as it has been shown to have taken place, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what has not been even announced.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>Who, now, should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> better the marrow of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> than the school of Christ itself?&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom the Lord both chose for Himself as scholars, certainly to be fully instructed in all points, and appointed to us for masters to instruct us in all points. To whom would He have rather made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the veiled import of His own language, than to him to whom He disclosed the likeness of His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>&mdash; to Peter, John, and James, and afterwards to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, to whom He granted participation in (the joys of) paradise too, prior to his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>?

Addressing the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, Peter, at all events, says, <q>How great indeed is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, if you suffer patiently, without being punished as evildoers!

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>But how <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, from being a persecutor, who first of all shed the blood of the church, though afterwards he exchanged the sword for the pen, and turned the dagger into a plough, being <em>first</em> a ravening wolf of Benjamin, then himself supplying food as did Jacob, &mdash; how he, (I say,) speaks in favour of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>, now to be chosen by himself also, when, rejoicing over the Thessalonians, he says, <q>So that we <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in you in the churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for your patience and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in all your <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> and tribulations, in which you endure a manifestation of the righteous judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may be accounted worthy of His kingdom, for which you also suffer!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038307"><a href="../bible/2th001.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;1:4</a></span> As also in his Epistle to the Romans: <q>And not only so, but we <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in tribulations also, being sure that tribulation works patience, and patience experience, and experience hope; and hope makes not ashamed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038308"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;5:3</a></span> And again: <q>And if children, then heirs, heirs indeed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and joint-heirs with Christ: if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> together.

Shall tribulation, or distress, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (As it is written: For Your sake we are killed all the day long; we have been counted as sheep for the slaughter.) Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors, through Him who loved us. For we are persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor power, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038310"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse35">Romans&nbsp;8:35</a></span> But further, in recounting his own sufferings to the Corinthians, he certainly decided that suffering must be borne: <q>In labours, (he says,) more abundant, in prisons very frequent, in deaths oft.

And if these severities will seem to be more grievous than <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>, yet once more he says: <q>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, in distresses for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038312"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:10</a></span> He also says, in verses occurring in a previous part of the epistle: <q>Our condition is such, that we are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; and are in need, but not in utter want; since we are harassed by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, but not forsaken; it is such that we are cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in our body the dying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038313"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:8</a></span> <q>But though,</q> says he, <q>our outward man perishes</q>&mdash; the flesh doubtless, by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>&mdash; <q>yet the inward man is renewed day by day</q>&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, doubtless, by hope in the promises. <q>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> weight of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal</q>&mdash; he is speaking of troubles; <q>but the things which are not seen are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a></q>&mdash; he is promising rewards. But writing in bonds to the Thessalonians,  he certainly affirmed that they were blessed, since to them it had been given not only to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ, but also to suffer for His sake. <q>Having,</q> says he, <q>the same conflict which you both saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038315"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse17">Philippians&nbsp;2:17</a></span> <q>For though I am offered upon the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with you all; in like manner do you also <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with me.</q> You see what he decides the bliss of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> to be, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of which he is providing a festival of mutual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. When at length he had come to be very near the attainment of his desire, greatly rejoicing in what he saw before him, he writes in these terms to Timothy: <q>For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; there is laid up for me the crown which the Lord will give me on that day</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038316"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:6</a></span> &mdash; doubtless of his suffering. Admonition enough did he for his part also give in preceding passages: <q>It is a faithful saying: For if we are dead with Christ, we shall also live with Him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us; if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, yet He is faithful: He cannot deny Himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038317"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:11</a></span> <q>Be not ashamed, therefore, of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038318"><a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:8</a></span> for he had said before: <q>For God has not given us the spirit of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but of power, and of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and of a sound mind.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038319"><a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:7</a></span> For we suffer with power from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> toward <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with a sound <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, when we suffer for our blamelessness. But further, if He anywhere enjoins endurance, for what more than for sufferings is He providing it? If anywhere He tears men away from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, what more than <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> takes the lead, in tearing them away to its injury?</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the apostle admonishes the Romans <span class="stiki" id="note038320"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;13:1</a></span> to be subject to all power, because there is no power but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and because (the ruler) does not carry the sword without reason, and is the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nay also, says he, a revenger to execute <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> upon him that does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For he had also previously spoken thus: <q>For rulers are not a terror to a good work, but to an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Will you then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and you shall have praise of it. Therefore he is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, be afraid.</q> Thus he bids you be subject to the powers, not on an opportunity occurring for his avoiding <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, but when he is making an appeal in behalf of a good life, under the view also of their being as it were assistants bestowed upon righteousness, as it were handmaids of the divine court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, which even here pronounces sentence beforehand upon the guilty. Then he goes on also to show how he wishes you to be subject to the powers, bidding you pay <q>tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038321"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;13:6</a></span> that is, the things which are C&aelig;sar's to C&aelig;sar, and the things which are God's to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note038322"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;22:21</a></span> but man is the property of God alone. Peter, <span class="stiki" id="note038323"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:13</a></span> no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, had likewise said that the king indeed must be honoured, yet so that the king be honoured <em>only</em> when he keeps to his own sphere, when he is far from assuming divine honours; because both father and mother will be loved along with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not put on an equality with Him. Besides, one will not be permitted to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> even life more than God.</p>

<h2 id="chapter15">Chapter 15</h2>

<p>Now, then, the epistles of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> also are well known. And do <em>we</em>, (you say), in all respects guileless <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and doves merely, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to go astray? I should think from eagerness to live. But let it be so, that meaning departs from their epistles. And yet, that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> endured such sufferings, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: the teaching is clear. This only I perceive in running through the Acts. I am not at all on the search. The prisons there, and the bonds, and the scourges, and the big stones, and the swords, and the onsets by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and the assemblies of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and the indictments by tribunes, and the hearing of causes by kings, and the judgment-seats of proconsuls and the name of C&aelig;sar, do not need an interpreter. That Peter is struck,  that Stephen is overwhelmed <em>by stones</em>, <span class="stiki" id="note038325"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse59">Acts&nbsp;7:59</a></span> that James is slain  as is a victim at the altar, that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is beheaded has been written in their own blood. And if a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> wishes his confidence to rest upon a public record, the archives of the empire will speak, as would the stones of Jerusalem. We read the lives of the C&aelig;sars: At Rome <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> was the first who stained with blood the rising <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Then is Peter girt by another, <span class="stiki" id="note038327"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;21:18</a></span> when he is made fast to the cross. Then does <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> obtain a birth suited to Roman citizenship, when in Rome he springs to life again ennobled by <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Wherever I read of these occurrences, so soon as I do so, I learn to suffer; nor does it signify to me which I follow as teachers of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, whether the declarations or the deaths of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, save that in their deaths I recall their declarations also. For they would not have suffered ought of a kind they had not previously <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> they had to suffer. When <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a>, making use of corresponding action too, had foretold that bonds awaited <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, weeping and entreating that he would not venture upon going to Jerusalem, entreated in vain. <span class="stiki" id="note038328"><a href="../bible/act021.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;21:11</a></span> As for him, having a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to illustrate what he had always taught, he says, <q>Why do you weep, and grieve my heart? But for my part, I could wish not only to suffer bonds, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of my Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> And so they yielded by saying, <q>Let the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord be done;</q> feeling sure, doubtless, that sufferings are included in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For they had tried to keep him back with the intention not of dissuading, but to show <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for him; as yearning for (the preservation of) the apostle, not as counselling against <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. And if even then a Prodicus or <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> stood by, suggesting that one must not confess on the earth before men, and must do so the less in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that God may not (seem to) thirst for blood, and Christ for a repayment of suffering, as though He besought it with the view of obtaining <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by it for Himself also, he would have immediately heard from the servant of God what the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> had from the Lord: <q>Get behind me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>; you are an offense unto me. It is written, You shall worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him only shall you serve.</q>  But even now it will be right that he hear it, seeing that, long after, he has poured forth these poisons, which not even thus are to injure readily any of the weak ones, if any one in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will drink, before being hurt, or even immediately after, this draught of ours.</p>
