<h1>Second Council of Constantinople</h1>

<h2>Session I - Extracts from the Acts</h2>

<p>[<em>The Emperor's Letter which was read to the Fathers</em>.]</p>

<p>In the Name of our Lord God <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. The Emperor Flavius Justinian, German, Gothic, etc., and always Augustus, to the most blessed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and patriarchs, Eutychius of Constantinople, Apollinarius of Alexandria, Domninus of Theopolis, Stephen, George, and Damian, the most religious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> taking the place of that man of singular blessedness, Eustochius, the Archbishop and Patriarch of Jerusalem, and the other most religious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> stopping in this royal city from the different provinces.</p>

<p>[<em>The following is the letter condensed, including <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele's</a> digest</em>. History of the Councils, <em>Vol. IV., p.</em> 298.]</p>

<p>The effort of my predecessors, the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Emperors, ever aimed at the settling of controversies which had arisen respecting the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the calling of Synods. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> Constantine assembled 318 Fathers at Nice, and was himself present at the Council, and assisted those who confessed the Son to be consubstantial with the Father. Theodosius, 150 at Constantinople, Theodosius the younger, the Synod of Ephesus, the Emperor Marcian, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Chalcedon. As, however, after Marcian's death, controversies respecting the Synod of Chalcedon had broken out in several places, the Emperor Leo wrote to all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of all places, in order that everyone might declare his opinion in writing with regard to this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Council. Soon afterwards, however, had arisen again the adherents of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> and Eutyches, and caused great divisions, so that many Churches had broken off communion with one another. When, now, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God raised us to the throne, we regarded it as our chief business to unite the Churches again, and to bring the Synod of Chalcedon, together with the three earlier, to universal acceptance. We have won many who previously opposed that Synod; others, who persevered in their opposition, we banished, and so restored the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> again. But the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> want to impose their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and, as they could not use <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> for that purpose, they made haste to introduce their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> through <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, the teacher of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, who taught still more grievous <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> than his. He maintained, <em>e.g.</em>, that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was one, and Christ another. For the same purpose they made use of those impious writings of Theodoret which were directed against the first Synod of Ephesus, against Cyril and his Twelve Chapters, and also the shameful letter which Ibas is said to have written. They maintain that this letter was accepted by the Synod of Chalcedon, and so would free from condemnation <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> and Theodore who were commended in the letter. If they were to succeed, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> could no longer be said to be <q>made man,</q> nor Mary called the Mother (<em>genetrix</em>) of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We, therefore, following the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, have first asked you in writing to give your judgment on the three impious chapters named, and you have answered, and have joyfully confessed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Because, however, after the condemnation proceeding from you, there are still some who defend the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, therefore we have summoned you to the capital, that you may here, in common assembly, place again your view in the light of day. When, for example, <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Vigilius</a>, Pope of Old Rome, came hither, he, in answer to our questions, repeatedly <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematised</a> in writing the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, and confirmed his steadfastness in this view by much, even by the condemnation of his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, Rusticus and Sebastian. We possess still his declarations in his own hand. Then he issued his <em>Judicatum</em>, in which he <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematised</a> the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, with the words, <em>Et quoniam</em>, etc. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he not only deposed Rusticus  and Sebastian because they defended the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, but also wrote to Valentinian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Scythia, and Aurelian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Arles, that nothing might be undertaken against the <em>Judicatum</em>. When you afterwards came hither at my invitation, letters were exchanged between you and <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Vigilius</a> in order to a common assembly.  But now he had altered his view, would no longer have a synod, but required that only the three patriarchs and one other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (in communion with the Pope and the three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> about him) should decide the matter. In vain we sent several commands to him to take part in the synod. He rejected also our two proposals, either to call a tribunal for decision, or to hold a smaller assembly, at which, besides him and his three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, every other patriarch should have place and voice, with from three to five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his diocese.* We further declare that we hold fast to the decrees of the four Councils, and in every way follow the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, Athanasius, Hilary, Basil, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory the Theologian</a>, Gregory of Nyssa, Ambrose, Theophilus, John (Chrysostom) of Constantinople, Cyril, Augustine, Proclus, Leo and their writings on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. As, however, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are resolved to defend <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> with their impieties, and maintain that that letter of Ibas was received by the Synod of Chalcedon, so do we exhort you to direct your attention to the impious writings of Theodore, and especially to his Jewish Creed which was brought forward at Ephesus and Chalcedon, and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> by each synod with those who had so held or did so hold; and we further exhort you to consider what the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers have written concerning him and his <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, as well as what our predecessors have promulgated, as also what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> historians have set forth concerning him.  You will thence see that he and his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> have since been condemned and that therefore his name has long since been struck from the diptychs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Mopsuestia. Consider the absurd assertion that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> ought not to be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> after their deaths; and we exhort you further to follow in this matter the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, who condemned not only living <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> but also <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> after their death those who had died in their iniquity, just as those who had been <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> condemned they restored after their death and wrote their names in the sacred diptychs; which took place in the case of John and of Flavian of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory, both of them <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Constantinople.  Moreover we exhort you to examine the writing of Theodoret and the supposed letter of Ibas, in which the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Word is denied, the expression <q><a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a></q> and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod of Ephesus rejected, Cyril called a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, and Theodore and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> defended and praised. And as they say that the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> has received this letter, you must compare the declarations of this Council relating to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with the contents of the impious letter. Finally, we entreat you to accelerate the matter. For he who when asked concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, puts off his answer for a long while, does nothing else but deny the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>. For in questioning and answering on things which are of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it is not he who is found first or second, but he who is the more ready with a right confession, that is acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. May God keep you, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and religious fathers, for many years. Given IV. Nones of May, at Constantinople, in the xxviith year of the reign of the imperial lord Justinian, the perpetual Augustus, and in the xiith year after the consulate of the most illustrious Basil.</p>

<h2>Session VII - Extracts from the Acts</h2>

<p>(<em>From the Paris manuscript found in</em> Hardouin <em>Concilia</em>, Tom. III., 171 et seqq.; Mansi, Tom. ix., 346 et seqq. <em>This speech is not found in full in any other ms. The Ballerini [<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a> notes] raise objections to the genuineness of the additions</em> [in Noris. <em>Opp.</em>, Tom. IV., 1037], but <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a> does not consider the objections of serious moment. [<em>Hist. of the Councils</em>, Vol. IV., p. 323, note 2.] <em>All the mss. agree that</em> The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> qu&aelig;ster of the sacred palace, Constantine, was sent by the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperor, and when he had entered the Council spoke as follows: <q>Certum est vestr&aelig; beatitudini, quantum, etc.</q> <em>The rest of the speech differs in the different manuscripts. I follow that of Paris.</em>)</p>

<p>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how much care the most invincible Emperor has always had that the contention raised up by certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with regard to the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> should have a termination....For this intent he has required the most religious <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Vigilius</a> to assemble with you and draw up a decree on this matter in accordance with the Orthodox <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Although therefore, <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Vigilius</a> has already frequently condemned the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> in writing, and has done this also by word of mouth in the presence of the Emperor, and of the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges and of many members of this synod, and has always been ready to smite with <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> the defenders of <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, and the letter which was attributed to Ibas, and the writings of Theodoret which he set forth against the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and against the twelve capitula of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Cyril:  yet he has refused to do this in communion with you and your synod.</p>

<p>Yesterday <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Vigilius</a> sent Servus Dei, a most reverend Subdeacon of the Roman Church, and invited Belisarius,  Cethegus, as also Justinus and Constantine the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> consuls, as well as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Theodore, Ascidas, Benignus, and Phocas, to come to him as he wished to give through them an answer to the Emperor. They came, but speedily returned and informed the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord, that we had visited <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Vigilius</a>, the most religious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and that he had said to us: <q>We have called you for this reason, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what things have been done in the past days. To this end I have written a document about the disputed <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, addressed to the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperor,  <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> be good enough to read it, and to carry it to his Serenity.</q> But when we had heard this and had seen the document written to your serenity, we said to him that we could not by any means receive any document written to the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperor without his bidding. <q>But you have <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> for running with messages, by whom you can send it.</q> He, however, said to us: <q>You now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I have made the document.</q> But we, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, answered him: <q>If your blessedness is willing to meet together with us and the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Patriarchs, and the most religious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and to treat of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> and to give, in unison with us all, a suitable form of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as the Holy Apostles and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers and the four Councils have done, we will hold you as our head, as a father and primate. But if your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has drawn up a document for the Emperor, you have errand-runners, as we have said; send it by them.</q> And when he had heard these things from us, he sent Servus Dei the Subdeacon, who now awaits the answer of your serenity. And when his Piety had heard this, he commanded through the aforesaid most religious and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> men, the before-named <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> to carry back this message to the most religious <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Vigilius</a>: <q>We invited him (<em>you</em>) to meet together with the most blessed patriarchs and other religious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and with them in common to examine and judge the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>. But since you have refused to do this, and you say that you alone have written by yourself somewhat on the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>; if you have condemned them, in accordance with those things which you did before, we have already many such statements and need no more; but if you have written now something contrary to these things which were done by you before, you have condemned yourself by your own writing, since you have departed from <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> doctrine and have defended impiety. And how can you expect us to receive such a document from you?</q></p>

<p>And when this answer was given by the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperor, he did not send through the same <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> any document in writing from himself. And all this was done without writing as also to your blessedness.</p>

<p>[<em>He then, according to all the mss., presented certain documents to be read, in the ms. printed by Labbe and Cossart, Tom. V., col.</em> 549 <em>et seqq. These are fewer than in the Paris ms., which last also contains the following just after the reading of the documents and after the Council had declared that they <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the Emperor's <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em>.]</p>

<p>Constantine, the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Qu&aelig;stor, said: While I am still present at your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council by reason of the reading of the documents which have been presented to you, I would say that the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperor has sent a minute (<em>formam</em>), to your Holy Synod, concerning the name of <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Vigilius</a>, that it be no more inserted in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> diptychs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, on account of the impiety which he defended. Neither let it be recited by you, nor retained, either in the church of the royal city, or in other churches which are entrusted to you and to the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the State committed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to his rule. And when you hear this minute, again you will perceive by it how much the most serene Emperor cares for the unity of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches and for the purity of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>.</p>

<p>[The letter was then read.]</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod said: What has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperor is congruous to the labours which he bears for the unity of the churches. Let us preserve unity to (<em>ad</em>) the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church of ancient Rome, carrying out all things according to the tenor of what has been read. De proposita vero qu&aelig;stione quod jam promisimus procedat.</p>

<h2>The Sentence of the Synod</h2>

<p>Our Great God and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, as we learn from the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, distributes talents to each man according to his ability, and at the fitting time demands an account of the work done by every man. And if he to whom but one talent has been committed is condemned because he has not worked with it but only kept it without loss, to how much greater and more horrible judgment must he be subject who not only is negligent concerning himself, but even places a stumbling-block and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of offense in the way of others? Since it is manifest to all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> that whenever any question arises concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not only the impious man himself is condemned, but also he who when he has the power to correct impiety in others, neglects to do so. </p>

<p>We therefore, to whom it has been committed to rule the church of the Lord, fearing the curse which hangs over those who negligently perform the Lord's work, hasten to preserve the good seed of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> pure from the tares of impiety which are being sown by the enemy.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we saw that the followers of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> were attempting to introduce their impiety into the church of God through the impious Theodore, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Mopsuestia, and through his impious writings; and moreover through those things which Theodoret impiously wrote, and through the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> epistle which is said to have been written by Ibas to Maris the Persian, moved by all these sights we rose up for the correction of what was going on, and assembled in this royal city called there by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the bidding of the most religious Emperor.</p>

<p>And because it happened that the most religious <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Vigilius</a> stopping in this royal city, was present at all the discussions with regard to the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, and had often condemned them orally and in writing, nevertheless afterwards he gave his consent in writing to be present at the Council and examine together with us the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, that a suitable definition of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> might be set forth by us all. Moreover the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperor, according to what had seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> between us, exhorted both him and us to meet together, because it is comely that the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> should after common discussion impose a common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. On this account we besought his reverence to fulfil his written promises; for it was not right that the scandal with regard to these <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> should go any further, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> be disturbed thereby. And to this end we brought to his remembrance the great examples left us by the Apostles, and the traditions of the Fathers. For although the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> abounded in each one of the Apostles, so that no one of them needed the counsel of another in the execution of his work, yet they were not willing to define on the question then raised touching the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, until being gathered together they had confirmed their own several sayings by the testimony of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>.</p>

<p>And thus they arrived unanimously at this sentence, which they wrote to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: <q>It has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and to us, to lay upon you no other burden than these necessary things, that you abstain from things offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication.</q></p>

<p>But also the Holy Fathers, who from time to time have met in the four <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> councils, following the example of the ancients, have by a common discussion, disposed of by a fixed decree the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and questions which had sprung up, as it was certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, that by common discussion when the matter in dispute was presented by each side, the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> expels the darkness of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>.</p>

<p>Nor is there any other way in which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> can be made manifest when there are discussions concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since each one needs the help of his neighbour, as we read in the Proverbs of Solomon: <q>A brother helping his brother shall be exalted like a walled city; and he shall be strong as a well-founded kingdom;</q> and again in Ecclesiastes he says: <q>Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</q></p>

<p>So also the Lord himself says: <q>Verily I say unto you that if two of you shall agree upon earth as touching anything they shall seek for, they shall have it from my Father which is in heaven. For wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</q></p>

<p>But when often he had been invited by us all, and when the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> judges had been sent to him by the most religious Emperor, he promised to give sentence himself on the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> (<em>sententiam proferre</em>): And when we heard this answer, having the Apostle's admonition in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that <q>each one must give an account of himself to God</q> and fearing the judgment that hangs over those who scandalize one, even of the least important, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how much sorer it must be to give offense to so entirely <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> an Emperor, and to the people, and to all the Churches; and further recalling what was said by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: <q>Fear not, but speak, and be not silent, for I am with you, and no one can harm you.</q> Therefore, being gathered together, before all things we have briefly confessed that we hold that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, delivered to his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles, and through them to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches, and which they who after them were <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers and doctors, handed down to the people credited to them.</p>

<p>We confessed that we hold, preserve, and declare to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches that confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which the 318 <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers more at length set forth, who were gathered together at Nice, who handed down the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <em>mathema</em> or creed. Moreover, the 150 gathered together at Constantinople set forth our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who followed that same confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and explained it. And the consent of the 200 <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers gathered for the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the first Council of Ephesus. And what things were defined by the 630 gathered at Chalcedon for the one and the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which they both followed and taught. And all those who from time to time have been condemned or <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and by the aforesaid four Councils, we confessed that we hold them condemned and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>. And when we had thus made profession of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we began the examination of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, and first we brought into review the matter of <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>; and when all the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> contained in his writings were made manifest, we marvelled at the long-suffering of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the tongue and mind which had framed such <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> were not immediately consumed by the divine fire; and we never would have suffered the reader of the aforenamed <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> to proceed, fearing [as we did] the indignation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for their record alone (as each <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> surpassed its predecessor in the magnitude of its impiety and moved from its foundation the mind of the hearer) had it not been that we saw they who gloried in such <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> stood in need of the confusion which would come upon them through their manifestation. So that all of us, moved with indignation by these <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both during and after the reading, broke forth into denunciations and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematisms</a> against Theodore, as if he had been living and present. O Lord be merciful, we cried, not even devils have dared to utter such things against you.</p>

<p>O intolerable tongue! O the depravity of the man! O that high hand he lifted up against his Creator! For the wretched man who had promised to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, had no recollection of the words of the Prophet Hosea, <q>Woe unto them! For they have fled from me: they have become famous because they were impious as touching me; they spoke iniquities against me, and when they had thought them out, they spoke the violent things against me. Therefore shall they fall in the snare by reason of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of their own tongues. Their contempt shall turn into their own bosom: because they have transgressed my covenant and have acted impiously against my <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>.</q></p>

<p>To these curses the impious Theodore is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> subject. For the prophecies concerning Christ he rejected and hastened to destroy, so far as he had the power, the great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the dispensation for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; attempting in many ways to show the divine words to be nothing but fables, for the mirth of the gentiles, and spurned the other prophetic announcements made against the impious, especially that which the divine Habacuc said of those who teach <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, <q>Woe unto him that gives his neighbour drink, that puttest your bottle to him and makest him drunken that you may look on their nakedness,</q> that is, their doctrines full of darkness and altogether foreign to the light.</p>

<p>And why should we add anything further? For anyone can take in his hands the writings of the impious Theodore or the impious chapters which from his impious writings were inserted by us in our acts, and find the incredible foolishness and the detestable things which he said. For we are afraid to proceed further and again to remember these infamies.</p>

<p>There was also read to us what had been written by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers against him, and his foolishness which exceeded that of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and moreover the histories and the imperial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, setting forth his impiety from the beginning, and since after all these things the defenders of his impiety, glorying in the injuries uttered by him against his Creator, said that it was not right to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> him after death, although we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a> concerning the impious, that even after death, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>; nevertheless we thought it necessary concerning this also to make examination, and there were found in the acts how various <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> had been <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> after death; and in many ways it was manifest to us that those who were saying this cared nothing for the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor for the Apostolic announcements, nor for the tradition of the Fathers. And we would like to ask them what they have to say to the Lord's having said of himself: <q>Whosoever should have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him, is not judged: but who should not have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him is judged already, because he has not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the name of the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</q> and of that exclamation of the Apostle: Although we or an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from heaven were to preach to you another gospel than that we have preached unto you, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>: as we have said, so now I say again, If anyone preach to you another gospel than that you have received, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p>For when the Lord says: <q>he is judged already,</q> and when the Apostle <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizes</a> even <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, if they teach anything different from what we have preached, how can even those who dare all things, presume to say that these words refer only to the living? Or are they <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, or is it not rather that they feign to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, that the judgment of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> is nothing else than that of separation from God? For the impious person, although he may not have been verbally <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> by anyone, nevertheless he really is <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>, having separated himself from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life by his impiety.</p>

<p>For what have they to answer to the Apostle again when he says, <q>A man that is an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> reject after the first and second corrections. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> that such a man is perverse, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and is condemned by himself.</q></p>

<p>In accordance with which words Cyril of blessed memory, in the books which he wrote against Theodore, says as follows: They are to be avoided who are in the grasp of such awful crimes whether they be among the quick or not. For it is necessary always to flee from that which is hurtful, and not to have respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but to consider what is pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And again the same Cyril of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory, writing to John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and to the synod assembled in that city concerning Theodore who was <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> together with <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, says thus: It was therefore necessary to keep a brilliant festival, since every voice which agreed with the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> had been cast out no matter whose. For it proceeded against all those who held these same opinions or had at one time held them, which is exactly what we and your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> have said: We <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> those who say that there are two Sons and two Christs. For one is he who is preached by us and you, as we have said, Christ, the Son and Lord, only begotten as man, according to the saying of the most learned <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. And also in his letter to Alexander and Martinian and John and Paregorius and Maximus, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and monastic fathers, and those who with them were leading the solitary life, he so says: The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod of Ephesus, gathered together according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> against the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> perfidy with a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and keen sentence condemned together with him the empty words of those who afterwards should embrace or who had in time past embraced the same opinions with him, and who presumed to say or write any such thing, laying upon them an equal condemnation. For it followed  naturally that when one was condemned for such profane emptiness of speech, the sentence should not come against one only, but (so to speak) against every one of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> or <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>, which they utter against the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, worshipping two Sons, and dividing the indivisible, and bringing in the crime of man-worship (<em>anthropolatry</em>), both into heaven and earth. For with us the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> multitude of the supernal spirits adore one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Moreover several letters of Augustine, of most religious memory, who shone forth resplendent among the African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, were read, showing that it was quite right that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> after death. And this <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a>, the other most reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Africa have preserved: and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Roman Church as well had <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> after their death, although they had not been accused of any falling from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> during their lives: and of each we have the evidence in our hands.</p>

<p>But since the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Theodore and of his impiety, who are so manifestly enemies of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, have attempted to bring forward certain passages of Cyril of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory and of Proclus, as though they had been written in favour of Theodore, it is opportune to fit to them the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> when he says: <q>The ways of the Lord are right and the just walk therein; but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall be weak in them.</q> For these, evilly receiving the things which have been well and opportunely written by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, and making excuses in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, quote these words. The fathers do not appear as delivering Theodore from <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, but rather as economically using certain expressions on account of those who defended <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> and his impiety, in order to draw them away from this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and to lead them to perfection and to teach them to condemn not only <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the impiety, but also his teacher Theodore. So in these very words of economy the Fathers show their intention on this point, that Theodore should be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>, as has been abundantly demonstrated by us in our acts from the writings of Cyril and Proclus of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory with regard to the condemnation of Theodore and his impiety. And such economy is found in <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>: and it is evident that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the Apostle made use of this in the beginning of his ministry, in relation to those who had been brought up as <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> Timothy, that by this economy and condescension he might lead them on to perfection. But afterwards he forbade <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, writing thus to the Galatians: <q>Behold, I <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> say to you, that if you be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> Christ profits you nothing.</q> But we found that that which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were wont to do, the defenders of Theodore had done also. For cutting out certain of the things which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers had written, and placing with them and mixing up certain false things of their own, they have tried by a letter of Cyril of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory as though from a testimony of the Fathers, to free from <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> the aforesaid impious Theodore: in which very passages the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was demonstrated, when the parts which had been cut off were read in their proper order, and the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> was thoroughly evinced by the collation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But in all these things, they who spoke such vanities, <q>trusted in <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>,</q> as it is written, <q>they trust in <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, and speak vanity; they conceive grief and bring forth iniquity, weaving the spider's web.</q> When we had thus considered Theodore and his impiety, we took care to have recited and inserted in our acts a few of these things which had been impiously written by Theodoret against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> and against the Twelve Chapters of St. Cyril and against the First Council of Ephesus, also certain things written by him in defence of those impious ones Theodore and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, for the satisfaction of the reader; that all might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that these had been <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> cast out and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>. In the third place the letter which is said to have been written by Ibas to Maris the Persian, was brought forward for examination, and we found that it, too, should be read. When it was read immediately its impiety was manifest to all. And it was right to make the condemnation and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematism</a> of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, as even to this time there had been some question on the subject. But because the defenders of these impious ones, Theodore and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, were scheming in some way or other to confirm these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and their impiety, and were saying that this impious letter, which praised and defended Theodore and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> and their impiety, had been received by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> we thought it necessary to show that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod was free of the impiety which was contained in that letter, that it might be clear that they who say such things do not do so with the favour of this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council, but that through its name they may confirm their own impiety. And it was shown in the acts that in former times Ibas had been accused because of the very impiety which is contained in this letter; at first by Proclus, of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople, and afterwards by Theodosius, of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory, and by Flavian, who was ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in succession to Proclus, who delegated the examination of the matter to Photius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, and to Eustathius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of Beyroot. Afterwards the same Ibas, being found guilty, was cast out of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>. Such was the state of the case, how could anyone presume to say that that impious letter was received by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council of Chalcedon and that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council of Chalcedon agreed with it throughout? Nevertheless in order that they who thus <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council of Chalcedon may have no further opportunity of doing so, we ordered to be recited the decisions of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synods, to wit, of first Ephesus, and of Chalcedon, with regard to the Epistles of Cyril of blessed memory and of Leo, of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory, sometime Pope of Old Rome. And since we had learned from these that nothing written by anyone else ought to be received unless it had been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to agree with the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, we interrupted our proceedings so as to recite also the definition of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was set forth by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council of Chalcedon, so that we might compare the things in the epistle with this decree. And when this was done it was perfectly clear that the contents of the epistle were wholly opposite to those of the definition.</p>

<p>For the definition agreed with the one and unchanging <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> set forth as well by the 318 <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers as by the 150 and by those who assembled at the first synod at Ephesus. But that impious letter, on the other hand, contained the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> Theodore and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, and defended them, and calls them doctors, while it calls the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<p>And this we made manifest to all, that we did not have any intention of omitting the Fathers of the first and second interlocutions, which the followers of Theodore and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> cited on their side, but these and all the others having been read and their contents examined, we found that the aforesaid Ibas was not allowed to be received without being compelled to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> and his impious teachings, which were defended in that epistle. And this the rest of the religious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Council did as well as those two whose interlocutions certain tried to use.</p>

<p>For this they observed in the case of Theodoret, and required him to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> those things of which he was accused. If therefore they were willing to allow the reception of Ibas in no other manner unless he condemned the impiety which was contained in his letters, and subscribed the definition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> adopted by the Council, how can they attempt to make out that this impious letter was received by the same <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council? For we are taught, <q>What fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion has light with darkness? And what concord has Christ with <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>? Or what part has he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> with an <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a>? And what agreement has the temple of God with <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.</q></p>

<p>Having thus detailed all that has been done by us, we again confess that we receive the four <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synods, that is, the Nicene, the Constantinopolitan, the first of Ephesus, and that of Chalcedon, and we have taught, and do teach all that they defined respecting the one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And we account those who do not receive these things aliens from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Moreover we condemn and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a>, together with all the other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who have been condemned and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> by the before-mentioned four <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synods, and by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church, Theodore who was Bishop of Mopsuestia, and his impious writings, and also those things which Theodoret impiously wrote against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, and against the Twelve Chapters of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Cyril, and against the first Synod of Ephesus, and also those which he wrote in defence of Theodore and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>. In addition to these we also <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> the impious Epistle which Ibas is said to have written to Maris, the Persian, which denies that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was incarnate of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, and ever Virgin Mary, and accuses Cyril of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory, who taught the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, and of the same sentiments with <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, and blames the first Synod of Ephesus as deposing <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> without examination and inquiry, and calls the Twelve Chapters of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Cyril impious, and contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, and defends Theodorus and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, and their impious <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> and writings. We therefore <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> before-mentioned, that is, the impious <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, with his execrable writings, and those things which Theodoret impiously wrote, and the impious letter which is said to be of Ibas, and their defenders, and those who have written or do write in defence of them, or who dare to say that they are correct, and who have defended or attempt to defend their impiety with the names of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, or of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. These things therefore being settled with all accuracy, we, bearing in remembrance the promises made respecting the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, and who it was that said that the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> should not prevail against her, that is, the deadly tongues of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; remembering also what was prophesied respecting it by Hosea, saying, <q>I will betroth you unto me in faithfulness, and you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Lord,</q> and numbering together with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, the father of lies, the unbridled tongues of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who persevered in their impiety unto death, and their most impious writings, will say to them, <q>Behold, as you kindle a fire, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the flame of the fire to grow strong, you shall walk in the light of your fire, and the flame which you kindle.</q> But we, having a commandment to exhort the people with right doctrine, and to speak to the heart of Jerusalem, that is, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, do rightly make haste to sow in righteousness, and to reap the fruit of life; and kindling for ourselves the light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, and the doctrine of the Fathers, we have considered it necessary to comprehend in certain Capitula, both the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</p>

<p>If anyone shall say that the wonder-working <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is one [Person] and the Christ that suffered another; or shall say that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was with the woman-born Christ, or was in him as one person in another, but that he was not one and the same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, incarnate and made man, and that his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and the sufferings which of his own will he endured in the flesh were not of the same [Person]: let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>If anyone shall say that the union of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> to man was only according to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or energy, or dignity, or equality of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, or authority, or relation, or effect, or power, or according to good pleasure in this sense that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was pleased with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that is to say, that he loved him for his own sake, as says the senseless Theodorus, or [if anyone pretends that this union exists only] so far as likeness of name is concerned, as the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> understand, who call also the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> Jesus and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and even accord to the man the names of Christ and of Son, speaking thus clearly of two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and only designating disingenuously one Person and one Christ when the reference is to his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, or his dignity, or his worship; if anyone shall not acknowledge as the Holy Fathers teach, that the union of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> is made with the flesh animated by a reasonable and living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and that such union is made synthetically and hypostatically, and that therefore there is only one Person, to wit: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, one of the Holy Trinity: let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. As a matter of fact the word <q>union</q> (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x1F11;&#x03BD;&#x1F7D;&#x03C2;&#x03B5;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;</span>) has many meanings, and the partisans of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a> and Eutyches have affirmed that these natures are confounded <em>inter se</em>, and have asserted a union produced by the mixture of both. On the other hand the followers of Theodorus and of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> rejoicing in the division of the natures, have taught only a relative union. Meanwhile the Holy <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, condemning equally the impiety of both sorts of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, recognises the union of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> with the flesh synthetically, that is to say, hypostatically. For in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Christ the synthetical union not only preserves unconfusedly the natures which are united, but also allows no separation.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>If anyone understands the expression <q>one only Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a></q> in this sense, that it is the union of many hypostases, and if he attempts thus to introduce into the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Christ two hypostases, or two Persons, and, after having introduced  two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, speaks of one Person only out of dignity, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> or worship, as both Theodorus and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> insanely have written; if anyone shall <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, pretending that it made use of this expression [one hypostasis] in this impious sense, and if he will not recognize rather that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is united with the flesh hypostatically, and that therefore there is but one hypostasis or one only Person, and that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> has professed in this sense the one Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>: let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. For since one of the Holy Trinity has been made man, viz.: <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, the Holy Trinity has not been increased by the addition of another person or hypostasis.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>If anyone shall not call in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> acceptation, but only in a false acceptation, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, and ever-virgin Mary, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, or shall call her so only in a relative sense, believing that she bare only a simple man and that God the word was not incarnate of her, but that the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> resulted only from the fact that he united himself to that man who was born [of her];  if he shall <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> the Holy Synod of Chalcedon as though it had asserted the Virgin to be <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> according to the impious sense of Theodore; or if anyone shall call her the mother of a man (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BD;&#x03B8;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>) or the Mother of Christ (<span class="greek">&#x03A7;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>), as if Christ were not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and shall not confess that she is exactly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, because that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> who before all ages was begotten of the Father was in these last days made flesh and born of her, and if anyone shall not confess that in this sense the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod of Chalcedon acknowledged her to be the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>: let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>If anyone using the expression, <q>in two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>,</q> does not confess that our one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has been revealed in the divinity and in the humanity, so as to designate by that expression a difference of the natures of which an ineffable union is unconfusedly made, [a union] in which neither the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Word was changed into that of the flesh, nor that of the flesh into that of the Word, for each remained that it was by nature, the union being hypostatic; but shall take the expression with regard to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Christ in a sense so as to divide the parties, or recognising the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> in the only <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> made man, does not content himself with taking in a theoretical manner  the difference of the natures which compose him, which difference is not destroyed by the union between them, for one is composed of the two and the two are in one, but shall make use of the number [two] to divide the natures or to make of them Persons properly so called: let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. </p>

<p>If anyone uses the expression <q>of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>,</q> confessing that a union was made of the Godhead and of the humanity, or the expression <q>the one nature made flesh of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>,</q> and shall not so understand those expressions as the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers have taught, to wit: that of the divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there was made an hypostatic union, whereof is one Christ; but from these expressions shall try to introduce one nature or substance [made by a mixture] of the Godhead and manhood of Christ; let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. For in teaching that the only-begotten Word was united hypostatically [to humanity] we do not mean to say that there was made a mutual confusion of natures, but rather each [nature] remaining what it was, we understand that the Word was united to the flesh. Wherefore there is one Christ, both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, consubstantial with the Father as touching his Godhead, and consubstantial with us as touching his manhood. Therefore they are equally condemned and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, who divide or part the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the divine dispensation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or who introduce confusion into that <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>.</p>

<p>If anyone shall take the expression, Christ ought to be worshipped in his two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, in the sense that he wishes to introduce thus two adorations, the one in special relation to <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> and the other as pertaining to the man; or if anyone to get rid of the flesh, [that is of the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,] or to mix together the divinity and the humanity, shall speak monstrously of one only nature or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x1F7B;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BD; &#x1F24;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03BD; &#x03BF;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>) of the united (natures), and so worship Christ, and does not venerate, by one adoration, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> made man, together with his flesh, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Holy Church</a> has taught from the beginning: let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<h3>12</h3>

<p>If anyone defends the impious <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, who has said that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is one person, but that another person is Christ, vexed by the sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the desires of the flesh, and separated little by little above that which is inferior, and become better by the progress in good works and irreproachable in his manner of life, as a mere man was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and obtained by this <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and became worthy of Sonship, and to be worshipped out of regard to the Person of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> (just as one worships the image of an emperor) and that he has become, after the resurrection, unchangeable in his thoughts and altogether without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And, again, this same impious Theodore has also said that the union of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> with Christ is like to that which, according to the doctrine of the Apostle, exists between a man and his wife, <q>They two shall be in one flesh.</q> The same [Theodore] has dared, among numerous other <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, to say that when after the resurrection the Lord breathed upon his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, saying, <q>Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> he did not really give them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but that he breathed upon them only as a sign. He likewise has said that the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> made by Thomas when he had, after the resurrection, touched the hands and the side of the Lord, viz.: <q>My Lord and my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> was not said in reference to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but that Thomas, filled with wonder at the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the resurrection, thus thanked God who had raised up Christ. And moreover (which is still more scandalous) this same Theodore in his Commentary on the Acts of the Apostles compares Christ to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, Manich&aelig;us, <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> and <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, and says that as each of these men having discovered his own doctrine, had given his name to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who were called Platonists, Manicheans, <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> and Marcionites, just so Christ, having discovered his doctrine, had given the name <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. If, then, anyone shall defend this most impious Theodore and his impious writings, in which he vomits the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> mentioned above, and countless others besides against our Great God and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and if anyone does not <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> him or his impious writings, as well as all those who protect or defend him, or who assert that his exegesis is <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, or who write in favour of him and of his impious works, or those who share the same opinions, or those who have shared them and still continue unto the end in this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>: let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<h2>The Decretal Epistle of Pope Vigilius in Confirmation of the Fifth Ecumenical Synod</h2>

<div class="stiki">
<p>At last the <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> resigned himself to the advice of the Council, and six months afterwards wrote a letter to the Patriarch Eutychius, wherein he confesses that he has been wanting in charity in dividing from his brethren. He adds, that one ought not to be ashamed to retract, when one recognises the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and brings forward the example of Augustine. He says, that, after having better examined the matter of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, he finds them worthy of condemnation. <q>We recognize for our brethren and colleagues all those who have condemned them, and annul by this writing all that has been done by us or by others for the defence of the three chapters.</q></p>

<p>The manuscript from which this letter was printed was found in the Royal Library of Paris by Peter de Marca and by him first published, with a Latin translation and with a dissertation. Both of these with the Greek text are found in Labbe and Cossart's <em>Concilia</em>, Tom. V., col. 596 <em>et seqq</em>.; also in Migne's <em>Patr. Lat</em>., Tom. LXIX., col. 121 <em>et seqq</em>. Some doubts have been expressed about its genuineness and Harduin is of opinion that the learned Jesuit, Garnerius, in his notes on the Deacon Leberatus's <em>Breviary</em>, has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> its supposititious character. But the learned have not generally been of this mind but have accepted the letter as genuine.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Vigilius</a> to his beloved brother Eutychius.</p>

<p>No one is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the scandals which the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> has stirred up in all the world: so that he made each one with a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> object in view, striving in some way to fulfil his wish to destroy the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> spread over the whole world, not only in his own name but even in ours and in those of others to compose diverse things as well in words as in writing; in so much that he attempted to divide us who, together with our brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, are stopping in this royal city, and who defend with equal reverence the four synods, and sincerely persist in the one and the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those four synods, by his sophistries and machinations he tried to part from them; so that we ourselves who were and are of the same opinion as they touching the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, went apart into discord, brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> being despised. </p>

<p>But since Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, whom the darkness comprehends not, has removed all confusion from our minds, and has so recalled peace to the whole world and to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so that what things should be defined by us have been healthfully fulfilled through the revelation of the Lord and through the investigation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, my dear brothers, I do you to wit, that in common with all of you, our brethren, we receive in all respects the four synods, that is to say the Nicene, the Constantinopolitan, the first Ephesian, and the Chalcedonian; and we venerate them with devout <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and watch over them with all our mind. And should there be any who do not follow these <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synods in all things which they have defined concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we judge them to be aliens to the communion of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>Wherefore on account of our desire that you, my brothers, should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what we have done in this matter, we make it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you by this letter. For no one can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> how many were the discussions raised on account of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, that is, concerning Theodore, sometime <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Mopsuestia, and his writings, as well as concerning the writings of Theodoret, and concerning that letter which is said to have been written by Ibas to Maris the Persian: and how diverse were the things spoken and written concerning these <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>. Now if in every business  sound wisdom demands that there should be a retractation of what was propounded after examination, there ought to be no shame when what was at first omitted is made public after it is discovered by a further study of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. [And if this is the case in ordinary affairs] how much more in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> strifes should the same dictate of sound reason be observed? Especially since it is manifest that our Fathers, and especially the blessed Augustine, who was in very truth illustrious in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>, and a master in Roman eloquence, retracted some of his own writings, and corrected some of his own sayings, and added what he had omitted and afterward found out. We, led by their example never gave over the study of the questions raised by the controversy with regard to the before-mentioned <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, nor our search for passages in the writings of our Fathers which were applicable to the matter.</p>

<p>As a result of this investigation it became evident that in the sayings of <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> (which are spoken against on all hands) there are contained very many things contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> and to the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers; and for this very reason these same <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers have left for the instruction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> treatises which they had written against him.</p>

<p>For among other <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> of his we find that he openly said that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was one [Person] and Christ another [Person], vexed with the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and with the desires of the flesh, and that he little by little advanced from a lower to a higher stage of excellence by the improvement (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x1FC7;</span>, <em>per profectum operum</em>) of his works, and became irreprehensible in his manner of life.  And further he taught that it was a mere man who was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and that he received through his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and merited his adoption; and therefore that Christ could be venerated in the same way that the image of the Emperor is venerated as being the persona (<span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F30;&#x03C2; &#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03C3;&#x03C9;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>) of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>. And he also taught that [only] after his resurrection he became immutable in his thoughts and altogether impeccable.</p>

<p>Moreover he said that the union of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was made with Christ as the Apostle says the union is made between a man and his wife: They two shall be one flesh; and that after his resurrection, when the Lord breathed upon his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and said, Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he did not give to them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. In like strain of profanity he dared to say that the confession which Thomas made, when he touched the hands and side of the Lord after his resurrection, saying, My Lord and my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, did not apply to Christ (for Theodore did not acknowledge Christ to be God); but that Thomas gave <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to God being filled with wonder at the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the resurrection, and so said these words.</p>

<p>But what is still worse is this, that in interpreting the Acts of the Apostles, Theodore makes <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> like to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and Manich&aelig;us, and <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, and Marcian, saying: Just as each of these were the authors of their own peculiar teachings, and called their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after their own names, Platonists, and <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>, and Marcionites, just so <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> invented <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> and called his followers <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> after himself.</p>

<p>Let therefore the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> and irreproachably we have arrived at the conclusions contained in this our constitution. Wherefore we condemn and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> Theodore, formerly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Mopsuestia, and his impious writings, together with all other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who (as is manifest) have been condemned and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> by the four <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synods aforesaid, and by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: also the writings of Theodoret which are opposed to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, and are against the Twelve Chapters of St. Cyril, and against the first Council of Ephesus, which were written by him in defence of Theodore and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover we <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> and condemn the letter to the Persian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Maris, which is said to have been written by Ibas, which denies that Christ the Word was incarnate of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and ever-virgin Mary, and was made man, but declares that a mere man was born of her, and this man it styles a temple, so from this we are given to understand that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> is one [Person] and Christ another [Person]. Moreover it <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniates</a> Saint Cyril, the master and herald of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, calling him a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, and charging him with writing things similar to <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>; and it reviles the first Synod of Ephesus, as having condemned <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> without deliberation or investigation; it likewise declares the twelve chapters of St. Cyril to be impious and contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>; and further still it defends Theodore and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, and their impious teachings and writings.</p>

<p>Therefore we <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> and condemn the aforesaid impious <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, to-wit, the impious <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> and his impious writings; And all that Theodoret impiously wrote, as well as the letter said to have been written by Ibas, in which are contained the above mentioned profane <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>. We likewise subject to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> whoever shall at any time <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that these chapters should be received or defended; or shall attempt to subvert this present condemnation.</p>

<p>And further we define that they are our brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who ever keep the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> set forth by those afore-mentioned synods, and shall have condemned the above-named <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, or even do now condemn them.</p>

<p>And further we annul and evacuate by this present written definition of ours whatever has been said by me (<em>a me</em>) or by others in defence of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>.</p>

<p>Far be it from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that anyone should say that all the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> above related or they who held and followed such things, were received by the before-mentioned four synods or by any one of them. For it is most clear, that no one was admitted by the before-mentioned <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers and especially by the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, about whom there was any suspicion, unless he had first repelled the above-named <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> and all like to them, or else had denied and condemned the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> of which he was suspected.</p>
