<h1>Second Council of Nic&aelig;a</h1>

<h2> The Divine  Sacra  Sent by the Emperors Constantine and Irene to the Most Holy and Most Blessed Hadrian, Pope of Old Rome.</h2>

<p>(<em>Found in Labbe and Cossart</em>, Concilia, <em>Tom. VII., col. 32</em>.)</p>

<p>They who receive the dignity of the empire, or the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the principal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, ought to provide and to care for those things which please him, and rule and govern the people committed to their care according to his will and good pleasure.</p>

<p>Therefore, O most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Head (Caput), it is incumbent upon us and you, that irreprehensibly we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things which be his, and that in these we exercise ourselves, since from him we have received the imperial dignity, and you the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">chief priesthood</a>.</p>

<p>But now to speak more to the point. Your paternal blessedness <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what has been done in times past in this our royal city against the venerable images, how those who reigned immediately before us destroyed them and subjected them to disgrace and injury: (O may it not be imputed to them, for it had been better for them had they not laid their hands upon the Church!)&mdash; and how they seduced and brought over to their own opinion all the people who live in these parts&mdash; yea, even the whole of the East, in like manner, up to the time in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has exalted us to this kingdom, who seek his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and hold that which has been handed down by his Apostles together with all other teachers. Whence now with pure heart and unfeigned religion we have, together with all our subjects and our most learned divines, had constant conferences respecting the things which relate to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by their advice have determined to summon a General Council. And we entreat your paternal blessedness, or rather the Lord God entreats, <q>who will have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved and to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> that you will give yourself to us and make no delay, but come up hither to aid us in the confirmation and establishment of the ancient tradition of venerable images. It is, indeed, incumbent on your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to do this, since you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how it is written&mdash; <q>Comfort, comfort my people, you <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, says the Lord,</q> and <q>the lips of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall keep <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and the law shall go forth out of his mouth, for he is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord of Hosts.</q> And again, the divine Apostle, the preacher of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, who, <q>from Jerusalem and round about unto <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a>, preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>,</q> has thus commanded&mdash; <q>Feed with discipline the flock of Christ which he purchased with his own blood.</q> As then you are the veritable chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (<em>primus sacerdos</em>) who presides in the place and in the see of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and superlaudable Apostle Peter, let your paternal blessedness come to us, as we have said before, and add your presence to all those other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who shall be assembled together here, that thus the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord may be accomplished. For as we are taught in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> our Lord says&mdash; <q>When two or three are met together in my name, there am I in the midst of them</q>&mdash; let your paternal and sacred blessedness be certified and confirmed by the great God and King of all, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and by us his servants, that if you come up hither you shall be received with all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and that everything necessary for you shall be granted. And again, when the definition (<em>capitulum</em>) shall be completed, which by the good pleasure of Christ our God we hope shall be done, we take upon us to provide for you every facility of returning with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and distinction. If, however, your blessedness cannot attend upon us (which we can scarcely <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what is your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> about divine things), at least, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> select for us men of understanding, having with them letters from your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, that they may be present here in the person of your sacred and paternal blessedness. So, when they meet with the other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are here, the ancient tradition of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers may be synodically confirmed, and every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> plant of tares may be rooted out, and the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a> may be fulfilled, that <q>the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail against her.</q> And after this, may there be no further <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and separation in the one <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church, of which Christ our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God is the Head.</p>

<p>We have had Constantine, beloved in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Bishop of Leontina in our beloved <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, with whom your paternal blessedness is well acquainted, into our presence; and, having spoken with him face to face, have sent him with this our present venerable jussio to you. Whom, after that he has seen you, immediately dismiss, that he may come back to us, and write us by him concerning your coming&mdash; what time we may expect will be spent in your journeying thence and coming to us. Moreover, he can retain with him the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Bishop of Naples, and come up hither together with him. And, as your journey will be by way of Naples and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> we have given orders to the Governor of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> about this, that he take due care to have every needful preparation made for your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and rest, which is necessary in order that your paternal blessedness may come to us. Given on the ivth before the calends of September, the seventh indiction, from the Royal City.</p>

<h2>The Imperial Sacra</h2>

<p> <em>Read at the First Session.</em></p>

<p>(<em>Found in Labbe and Cossart</em>, Concilia, <em>Tom. VII., col. 49</em>.)</p>

<p>Constantine and Irene&mdash; Sovereigns of the Romans in the Faith, to the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Bishops, who, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and by the command of our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Sovereignty, have met together in the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>.</p>

<p>The Wisdom which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Father&mdash; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God&mdash; who, by his most divine and wonderful dispensation in the flesh, has delivered us from all <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>: and, by taking on him our nature, has renewed the same by the co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which is of the same nature with himself; and having himself become the first High Priest, has counted you <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, worthy of the same dignity.</p>

<p>He is that good Shepherd who, bearing on his own shoulders that wandering sheep&mdash; fallen man, has brought him back to his own peculiar folds&mdash; that is, the party of angelic and ministering powers <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse14">Ephesians 2:14-15</a></span>, and has reconciled us in himself and having taken away the wall of partition, has broken down the enmity through his flesh, and has bestowed upon us a rule of conduct tending to peace; wherefore, preaching to all, he says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse9">Matthew 5:9</a></span>. Of which blessedness, confirming as it does the exaltation of the adoption of sons, our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Sovereignty desiring above all things to be made partakers, has ever applied the utmost diligence to direct all our Roman Commonwealth into the ways of unity and concord; and more especially have we been solicitous concerning the right regulation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, and most anxious in every way to promote the unity of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. For which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the Chiefs of the Sacerdotal Order of the East and of the North, of the West and of the South, are present in the person of their Representative Bishops, who have with them respectively the replies written in answers to the Synodical Epistle sent from the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Patriarch; for such was from the beginning the synodical regulation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, which, from the one end of the earth to the other, has received the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. On this account we have, by the good will and permission of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, caused you, his most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Priests, to meet together &mdash; you who are accustomed to dispense his Testimony in the unbloody <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>&mdash; that your decision may be in accordance with the definitions of former councils who decreed rightly, and that the splendour of the Spirit may illumine you in all things, for, as our Lord teaches, No man lights a candle and puts it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that it may give light to all that are in the house; even so, should you make such use of the various regulations which have been piously handed down to us of old by our Fathers, that all the Holy Churches of God may remain in peaceful order.</p>

<p>As for us, such was our <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash; such our earnest desire for the interests of religion, our care for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order, our anxiety that the ancient rules and orders should maintain their ground&mdash; that though fully engaged in military councils&mdash; though all our attention was occupied in political cares&mdash; yet, treating all these affairs as but of minor importance, we would allow nothing whatever to interfere with the convocation of your most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council. To every one is given the utmost freedom of expressing his sentiments without the least hesitation, that thus the subject under enquiry may be most fully discussed and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may be the more boldly spoken, that so all dissensions may be banished from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and we all may be united in the bonds of peace.</p>

<p>For, when the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Patriarch <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, by the divine will, was about to be liberated from the bands of mortality and to exchange his earthly pilgrimage for a heavenly home with his Master Christ, he abdicated the Patriarchate and took upon him the monastic life, and when we asked him, Why have you done this? He answered, Because I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that, if death should surprise me still in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of this royal and heaven-defended city, I should have to carry with me the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which consigns me to that outer darkness which is prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; for they say that a certain synod has been held here in order to the subversion of pictures and images which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> holds, embraces, and receives, in memory of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom they represent. This is that which distracts my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash; this is that which makes me anxiously to enquire how I may escape the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a>&mdash; since among such men I have been brought up and with such am I numbered. No sooner had he thus spoken in the presence of some of our most illustrious nobles than he expired.</p>

<p>When our Pious Sovereignty reflected on this awful declaration (and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, even before this event, we had heard of similar questionings from many around), we took counsel with ourselves as to what ought to be done; and we determined, after mature deliberation, that when a new Patriarch had been elected, we should endeavour to bring this subject to some decisive conclusion. Wherefore, having summoned those whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be most experienced in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, and having called upon Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we consulted with them who was worthy to be exalted to the chair of the Priesthood of this Royal and God-preserved city; and they all with one heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> gave their vote in favour of <a href="../cathen/14451b.htm">Tarasius</a>&mdash; he who now occupies the Pontifical Presidency. Having, therefore, sent for him, we laid before him our deliberations and our vote; but he would by no means consent, nor at all yield to that which had been determined. And when we enquired, Wherefore he thus refused his consent?&mdash; at first he answered evasively, That the yoke of the Chief Priesthood was too much for him. But we, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this to be a mere pretext <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveting</a> his unwillingness to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> us, would not desist from our importunity, but persisted in pressing the acceptance of the dignity of the Chief Priesthood upon him. When he found how urgent we were with him, he told us the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his refusal. It is (said he) because I perceive that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which has been founded on the rock, Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is rent and torn asunder by schisms, and that we are unstable in our confession, and that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the East, of the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with ourselves, decline communion with us, and unite them with those of the West; and so we are estranged from all, and each day are <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> by all: and, moreover, I should demand that an Ecumenical Council should be held, at which should be found Legates from the Pope of Rome and from the Chief Priests of the East. We, therefore, fully understanding these things, introduced him to the assembled company of the Priests&mdash; of our most illustrious Princes&mdash; and of all our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people; and then, in their presence, he repeated to them all that he had before said to us; which, when they heard, they received him joyfully, and earnestly entreated our peace-making and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Sovereignty that an Ecumenical Council might be assembled. To this their request, we gave our hearty consent; for, to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it is by the good will and under the direction of our God that we have assembled you together. Wherefore as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, willing to establish his own counsel, has for this purpose brought you together from all parts of the world, behold the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> now lying before you, and plainly crying aloud, <q>Judge <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>;</q> stand firm as champions of religion, and be ready with unsparing hand to cut away all innovations and new fangled inventions. And, as Peter the Chief of the Apostolic College, struck the mad slave and cut off his Jewish ear with the sword, so in like manner do you wield the axe of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and every tree which bears the fruit of contention, of strife, or newly-imported innovation, either renew by transplanting through the words of sound doctrine, or lay it low with canonical censure, and send it to the fires of the future Gehenna, so that the peace of the Spirit may evermore protect the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, compacted and united in one, and confirmed by the traditions of the Fathers; and so may all our Roman State enjoy peace as well as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>We have received letters from <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Hadrian</a>, most Holy Pope of old Rome, by his Legates&mdash; namely, Peter, the God-beloved Archpresbyter, and Peter, the God-beloved Presbyter and Abbot&mdash; who will be present in council with you; and we command that, according to synodical custom, these be read in the hearing of you all; and that, having heard these with becoming silence, and moreover the Epistles contained in two octavos sent by the Chief Priest and other Priests of the Eastern <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> by John, most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Monk and Chancellor of the Patriarchal throne of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and Thomas, Priest and Abbot, who also are present together with you, you may by these understand what are the sentiments of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> on this point.</p>

<h2>Extracts from the Acts</h2>

<h3>Session 1</h3>

<p>(Labbe and Cossart, <em>Concilia</em>, Tom. VII., col. 53.)</p>

<p>[<em>Certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been led astray by the Iconoclasts came, asking to be received back. The first of these was Basil of Ancyra</em>.]</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Basil of Ancyra read as follows from a book: Inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation has canonically been handed down from past time, even from the beginning from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles, and from their successors, who were our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers and teachers, and also from the six <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical synods, and from the local synods which were gathered in the interests of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, that those returning from any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> whatever to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and to the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, might deny their own <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and confess the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>Wherefore I, Basil, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of Ancyra, proposing to be united to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Hadrian</a> the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pope of Old Rome, and to <a href="../cathen/14451b.htm">Tarasius</a> the most blessed Patriarch, and to the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> apostolic sees, to wit, Alexandria, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and the Holy City, as well as to all <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> high-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, make this written confession of my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and I offer it to you as to those who have received power by apostolic authority. And in this also I beg pardon from your divinely gathered <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> for my tardiness in this matter. For it was not right that I should have fallen behind in the confession of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, but it arose from my entire lack of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> and negligent mind in the matter. Wherefore the rather I ask your blessedness to grant me indulgence in God's sight.</p>

<p>I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, therefore, and make my confession in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father Almighty, and in one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, his only begotten Son, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the Lord and Giver of Life. The Trinity, one in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and one in majesty, must be worshipped and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in one godhead, power, and authority. I confess all things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of one of the Holy Trinity, our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, as the Saints and the six Ecumenical Synods have handed down. And I reject and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> babbling, as they also have rejected them. I ask for the intercessions (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>) of our spotless Lady the Holy <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, and those of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and heavenly powers, and those of all the Saints. </p>

<p>Anathema to those who say that another than Christ our Lord has delivered us from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.</p>

<p>Anathema to those who spurn the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers and the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, taking as a pretext and making their own the arguments of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, Eutyches, and Dioscorus, that unless we were evidently taught by the Old and New Testaments, we should not follow the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers and of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Ecumenical Synods, and the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>Anathema to those who dare to say that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has at any time sanctioned <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.</p>

<p>Anathema to those who say that the making of images is a diabolical invention and not a tradition of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers.</p>

<p>This is my confession [of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>] and to these propositions I give my assent. And I pronounce this with my whole heart, and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and mind.</p>

<p>And if at any time by the fraud of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> (which may God forbid!) I voluntarily or involuntarily shall be opposed to what I have now professed, may I be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and every hierarchical order a stranger.</p>

<p>I will keep myself from every acceptance of a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a> and from filthy lucre in accordance with the divine canons of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles and of the approved Fathers.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/14451b.htm">Tarasius</a>, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Patriarch, said: This whole sacred gathering yields <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and thanks to God for this confession of yours, which you have made to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>Theodosius, the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and Ecumenical Synod: I confess and I agree to (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x1F77;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) and I receive and I salute and I venerate in the first place the spotless image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> image of her who bore him without seed, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, and her help and protection and intercessions each day and night as a sinner to my aid I call for, since she has confidence with Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as he was born of her. Likewise also I receive and venerate the images of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and most laudable Apostles, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and the fathers and cultivators of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. Not indeed as gods (God forbid!) do I ask all these with my whole heart to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he may grant me through their intercessions to find mercy at his hands at the day of judgment, for in this I am but showing forth more clearly the affection and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which I have borne them from the first. Likewise also I venerate and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and salute the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the Saints as of those who fought for Christ and who have received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from him for the healing of diseases and the curing of sicknesses and the casting out of devils, as the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Church has received from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles and Fathers even down to us today.</p>

<p>Moreover, I am well pleased that there should be images in the churches of the faithful, especially the image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, of every kind of material, both gold and silver and of every colour, so that his <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> may be set forth to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Likewise there may be painted the lives of the Saints and Prophets and Martyrs, so that their struggles and agonies may be set forth in brief, for the stirring up and teaching of the people, especially of the unlearned.</p>

<p>For if the people go forth with lights and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> to meet the <q>laurata</q> and images of the Emperors when they are sent to cities or rural districts, they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> surely not the tablet covered over with wax, but the Emperor himself. How much more is it necessary that in the churches of Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the image of God our Saviour and of his spotless Mother and of all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed fathers and <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetics</a> should be painted? Even as also St. Basil says: <q>Writers and painters set forth the great <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; the one by word, the other by their pencils; and each stirs many to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>.</q> And again the same author <q>How much pains have you ever taken that you might find one of the Saints who was willing to be your importunate intercessor to the Lord?</q>  And Chrysostom says, <q>The charity of the Saints is not diminished by their death, nor does it come to an end with their exit from life, but after their death they are still more powerful than when they were alive,</q> and many other things without measure. Therefore I ask you, O you Saints! I call out to you. I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against heaven and in your sight. Receive me as God received the luxurious man, and the harlot, and the thief. Seek me out, as Christ sought out the sheep that was lost, which he carried on his shoulders; so that there may be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> over my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and repentance, through your intervention, O all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> lords! Let them who do not venerate the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and venerable images be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>!

<p>If you persevere in that <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Faith in which you have begun, and the sacred and venerable images be by your means erected again in those parts, as by the lord, the Emperor Constantine of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory, and the blessed Helen, who promulgated the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Faith, and exalted the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Roman Church your spiritual mother, and with the other <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Emperors venerated it as the head of all Churches, so will your Clemency, that is protected of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, receive the name of another Constantine, and another Helen, through whom at the beginning the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church derived strength, and like whom your own imperial fame is spread abroad by triumphs, so as to be brilliant and deeply fixed in the whole world. But the more, if following the traditions of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Faith, you embrace the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of blessed Peter, chief of the Apostles, and, as of old your predecessors the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Emperors acted, so you, too, venerating it with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with all your heart his Vicar, and if your sacred majesty follow by preference their <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Faith, according to our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Roman Church. May the chief of the Apostles himself, to whom the power was given by our Lord God to bind and remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in heaven and earth, be often your protector, and trample all barbarous nations under your feet, and everywhere make you conquerors. For let sacred authority lay open the marks of his dignity, and how great veneration ought to be shown to his, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">highest See</a>, by all the faithful in the world. For the Lord set him who bears the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> as chief over all, and by Him is he honoured with this privilege, by which the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> are entrusted to him. He, therefore, that was preferred with so exalted an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> was thought worthy to confess that Faith on which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is founded. A blessed reward followed that blessed confession, by the preaching of which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> universal Church was illumined, and from it the other Churches of God have derived the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of Faith. For the blessed Peter himself, the chief of the Apostles, who first sat in the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, left the chiefship of his Apostolate, and pastoral care, to his successors, who are to sit in his most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> seat for ever. And that power of authority, which he received from the Lord God our Saviour, he too bestowed and delivered by divine command to the Pontiffs, his successors, etc.</p>

<p>If the ancient <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> be perfected and restored by your means in those regions, and the venerable icons be placed in their original state, you will be partakers with the Lord Constantine, Emperor of old, now in the Divine keeping, and the Empress Helena, who made conspicuous and confirmed the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Faith, and exalted still more your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Roman and spiritual Church, and with the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Emperors who ruled after them, and so your most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and heaven-protected name likewise will be set forth as that of another Constantine and another Helena, being renowned and praised through the whole world, by whom the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church is restored.

For they will extend their shield over your power, and all barbarous nations shall be put under your feet: and wherever you go they will make you conquerors. For the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and chief Apostles themselves, who set up the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Faith, have laid it down as a written law that all who after them are to be successors of their seats, should hold their Faith and remain in it to the end.</p>

<p>We greatly wondered that in your imperial commands, directed for the Patriarch of the royal city, <a href="../cathen/14451b.htm">Tarasius</a>, we find him there called Universal: but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether this was written through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. But henceforth we advise your most merciful and imperial majesty, that he be by no means called Universal in your writings, because it appears to be contrary to the institutions of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Canons and the decrees of the traditions of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers. For he never could have ranked second, save for the authority of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church, as is plain to all.  Because if he be named Universal, above the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Roman Church which has a prior rank, which is the head of all the Churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is certain that he shows himself as a rebel against the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Councils, and a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. For, if he is Universal, he is recognized to have the Primacy even over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of our See, which appears ridiculous to all faithful <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>: because in the whole world the chief rank and power was given to the blessed Apostle Peter by the Redeemer of the world himself; and through the same Apostle, whose place we unworthily hold, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Roman Church holds the first rank, and the authority of power, now and for ever, so that if any one, which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, has called him, or assents to his being called Universal, let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he is estranged from the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Faith, and a rebel against our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/14451b.htm">Tarasius</a> the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> patriarch said: Did you yourselves receive these letters from the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pope, and did you carry them to our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperor?</p>

<p>Peter and Peter the most beloved-of-God <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> who held the place of <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Hadrian</a>, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> pope of Rome, said: We ourselves received such letters from our apostolic father and delivered them to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lords.</p>

<p>John, the most magnificent Logothete, said: That this is the case is also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the Sicilians, the beloved of God Theodore, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catanea</a>, and the most revered <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Epiphanius who is with him, who holds the place of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of Sardinia.

<p>Theodore the God-beloved <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catanea</a>, standing in the midst, said: The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor, by his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> jussio, bid send Leo, the most god-beloved <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> (who together with myself is a slave of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>), with the precious letter of his most sacred majesty; and he who reveres our [<em>sic</em> in Greek, <q>your,</q> in Latin] <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, being the governor (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03B3;&#x1F78;&#x03C2;</span>) of my province of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, sent me to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> jussio of our <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Emperors. </p>

<p>And when the most blessed Pope heard it, he said: Since this has come to pass in the days of their reign, God has magnified their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> rule above all former reigns. And this suggestion (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03C6;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x1F70;&#x03BD;</span>) which has been read he sent to our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> kings together with a letter to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and with his vicars who are here present and presiding.</p>

<p>Cosmas, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, notary, and chamberlain (<em>Cubuclesius</em>) said: And another letter was sent by the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pope of Old Rome to <a href="../cathen/14451b.htm">Tarasius</a>, our most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and &oelig;cumenical Patriarch.

<p>Peter and Peter, the most reverend <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and representatives of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pope of Old Rome said: Let the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14451b.htm">Tarasius</a>, Patriarch of the royal city, say whether he agrees (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03C7;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;</span>) with the letters of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pope of Old Rome or not.</p>

And we also ourselves, having examined both in writing,  and by inquisition, and syllogistically and by demonstration, and having been taught by the teachings of the Fathers, so have confessed, so do confess, and so will confess; and shall be fast, and shall remain, and shall stand firm in the sense of the letters which have just been read, receiving the imaged representations according to the ancient tradition of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers; and these we venerate with firmly-attached  affection, as made in the name of Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of our Spotless Lady the Holy <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Holy Angels</a>, and of all the Saints, most clearly giving our adoration and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the one only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</p>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod said: The whole <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod thus teaches.</p>

But the worship of adoration I reserve alone to the supersubstantial and life-giving Trinity. And those who are not so minded, and do not so teach I cast out of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church, and I smite them with <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, and I deliver them over to the lot of those who deny the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> and the bodily economy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</p>

<h3>Session 4</h3>

<p>[<em>Among numerous passages of the Fathers one was read from a sermon by St. Gregory Nyssen in which he describes a painting representing the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of Isaac and tells how he could not pass it <q>without tears.</q></em>]</p>

<p>The most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> princes said: See how our father grieved at the depicted history, even so that he wept.</p>

<p>Basil, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Ancyra, said: Many times the father had read the story, but perchance he had not wept; but when once he saw it painted, he wept.</p>

<p>John the most reverend <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and representative of the Eastern high priests, said: If to such a doctor the picture was helpful and drew forth tears, how much more in the case of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and simple will it bring compunction and benefit.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod said: We have seen in several places the history of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> painted as the father says.</p>

<p>Theodore the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catanea</a>, said: If the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Gregory, vigilant  in divine cogitation, was moved to tears at the sight of the story of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, how much more shall a painting of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Christ</a>, who for us was made man, move the beholders to their profit and to tears?</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/14451b.htm">Tarasius</a> the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Patriarch said: Shall we not weep when we see an image of our crucified Lord?</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod said: We shall indeed&mdash; for in that shall be found perfectly the profundity of the abasement of the incarnate God for our sakes.</p>

<p>[<em>Post nonnulla a passage is read from St. Athanasius in which he describes the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> worked at Berytus, after which there is found the following</em> (col. 224),]</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/14451b.htm">Tarasius</a>, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Patriarch, said: But perhaps someone will say, Why do not the images which we have work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>? To which we answer, that as the Apostle has said, signs are for those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, not for <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. For they who approached that image were unbelievers. Therefore God gave them a sign through the image, to draw them to our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But <q>an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and adulterous generation that seeks after a sign and no sign shall be given it.</q></p>

<p>[<em>After a number of other quotations, was read the Canon of the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Council in Trullo</a> as a canon of the Sixth Synod</em> (col. 233).]</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/14451b.htm">Tarasius</a>, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Patriarch said: There are certain affected with the sickness of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> who are scandalized by these canons [viz. of the Trullan Synod] and say, And do you really think they were adopted at the Sixth Synod? Now let all such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> great Sixth Synod was assembled at Constantinople concerning those who said that there was but one energy and will in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. These <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and having expounded the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they went to their homes in the fourteenth year of Constantine. But after four or five years the same  fathers came together under Justinian, the son of Constantine, and set forth the before-mentioned canons. And let no one <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning them. For they who subscribed under Constantine were the same as they who under Justinian signed the present chart, as can manifestly be established from the unchangeable similarity of their own handwriting. For it was right that they who had appeared at an ecumenical synod should also set forth <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> canons. They said that we should be led as (by the hand) by the venerable images to the recollection of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and of his saving death, and if by them we are led to the realization of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what sort of an opinion shall we have of them who break down the venerable images?</p>

<p>[<em>At the close of the Session, after a number of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematisms</a> had been pronounced, the following was read, to which all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> subscribed</em> (col. 317).]</p>

<p>Fulfilling the divine precept of our God and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers did not hide the light of the divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> given by him to them under a bushel, but they set it upon the candlestick of most useful teaching, so that it might give light to all in the house&mdash; that is to say, to those who are born in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; lest perchance anyone of those who piously confess the Lord might strike his foot against the stone of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doctrine. For they expelled every <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and they cut off the rotten member if it was incurably sick. And with a fan they purged the floor. And the good wheat, that is to say the word which nourishes and which makes strong the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, they laid up in the granary of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but throwing outside the chaff of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> opinion they burned it with unquenchable fire. Therefore also this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical Synod, met together for the second time in this illustrious metropolis of Nice, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and at the bidding of our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and most faithful Emperors, Irene a new Helena, and a new Constantine, her God-protected offspring, having considered by their perusal the teachings of our approved and blessed Fathers, has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> God himself, from whom there was given to them wisdom for our instruction, and for the perfecting of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church: and against those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> as they did, but have attempted to overshadow the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> through their novelty, they have chanted the words of the psalm:  <q>Oh how much <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> have your enemies done in your sanctuary; and have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> themselves, saying, There is not a teacher any more, and they shall not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we treated with guile the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> But we, in all things holding the doctrines and precepts of the same our God-bearing Fathers, make proclamation with one mouth and one heart, neither adding anything, nor taking anything away from those things which have been delivered to us by them. But in these things we are strengthened, in these things we are confirmed. Thus we confess, thus we teach, just as the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical six Synods have decreed and ratified. We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Almighty, maker of all things visible and invisible; and in one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, his only-begotten Son and Word, through whom all things were made, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the Lord and giver of life, consubstantial and coeternal with the same Father and with his Son who has had no beginning. The unbuilt-up, indivisible, incomprehensible, and non-circumscribed Trinity; he, wholly and alone, is to be worshipped and revered with adoration; one Godhead, one Lordship, one dominion, one realm and dynasty, which without division is apportioned to the Persons, and is fitted to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> severally. For we confess that one of the same <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and consubstantial Trinity, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in these last days was incarnate and made man for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and having saved our race through his saving <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, and passion, and resurrection, and ascension into heaven; and having delivered us from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; as also the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, Not an ambassador, not an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but the Lord himself has saved us. Him we also follow, and adopt his voice, and cry aloud; No Synod, no power of kings, no God-hated agreement has delivered the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, as the Judaizing conciliabulum has madly dreamed, which raved against the venerable images; but the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> himself, the incarnate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has saved us and has snatched us from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> deceit. To him therefore be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, to him be thanks, to him be eucharists, to him be praise, to him be magnificence. For his redemption and his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> alone can perfectly save, and not that of other men who come of the earth. For he himself has fulfilled for us, upon whom the ends of the earth have come through the economy of his <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, the words spoken beforehand by his <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, for he dwelt among us, and went in and out among us, and cast out the names of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> from the earth, as it was written. But we salute the voices of the Lord and of his Apostles through which we have been taught to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in the first place her who is properly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the Mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and exalted above all the heavenly powers; also the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and angelic powers; and the blessed and altogether lauded Apostles, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Prophets and the triumphant Martyrs which fought for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and God-bearing Doctors, and all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men; and to seek for their intercessions, as able to render us at home with the all-royal God of all, so long as we keep his commandments, and strive to live virtuously. Moreover we salute the image of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and life-giving Cross, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the Saints; and we receive the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and venerable images: and we salute them, and we embrace them, according to the ancient traditions of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is to say of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, who also received these things and established them in all the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in every place of his dominion. These <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and venerable images, as has been said, we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and salute and reverently venerate: to wit, the image of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of our great God and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and that of our spotless Lady the all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, from whom he pleased to take flesh, and to save and deliver us from all impious <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; also the images of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and incorporeal Angels, who as men appeared to the just. Likewise also the figures and effigies of the divine and all-lauded Apostles, also of the God-speaking Prophets, and of the struggling Martyrs and of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men. So that through their representations we may be able to be led back in memory and recollection to the prototype, and have a share in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of some one of them.</p>

<p>Thus we have learned to think of these things, and we have been strengthened by our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, and we have been strengthened by their divinely handed down teaching. And thanks be to God for his ineffable gift, that he has not deserted us at the end nor has the rod of the ungodly come into the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous put their hands, that is to say their actual <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>,  unto <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. But he does well unto those who are good and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of heart, as the psalmist David melodiously has sung; with whom also we sing the rest of the psalm: As for such as turn back unto their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, the Lord shall lead them forth with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doers; and peace shall be upon the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h3>Session 6</h3>

<p>(Labbe and Cossart, <em>Concilia</em>, Tom. VII., col. 389.)</p>

<p>Leo the most renowned secretary said: The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed Synod <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how at the last session we examined various sayings of the God-forsaken <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who had brought charges against the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and spotless Church of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> for the setting up of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> images. But today we have in our hands the written <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of those <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, that is to say, the absurd, and easily answered, and self-convicting definition (<span class="greek">&#x1F45;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>) of the pseudosyllogus, in all respects agreeing with the impious opinion of the God-<a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. But not only have we this, but also the artful and most drastic refutation thereof, which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> had supervised. For it was right that this definition should be made a triumph by wise contradictions, and should be torn to pieces with strong refutations. This also we submit so as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your pleasure with regard to it.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod said: Let it be read.</p>

<p>John, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and chancellor [of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> great Church of Constantinople, <em>in Lat. only</em>] read.</p>

<p>[<em>John, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, then read the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> refutation, and Gregory, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Neoc&aelig;sarea, the Definition of the Mock Council, the one reading the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> statement and the other the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> answer</em>.]</p>

<h2>The Definition</h2> 

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and Ecumenical synod, which by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> command of the God-beloved and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Emperors, Constantine and Leo,  now assembled in the imperial residence city, in the temple of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and inviolate Mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Virgin Mary, surnamed in Blachern&aelig;, have decreed as follows.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> misguided men, so that they worshipped the creature instead of the Creator. The Mosaic law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> cooperated to undo this ruin; but in order to save <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> thoroughly, God sent his own Son, who turned us away from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and the worshipping of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and taught us the worshipping of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. As messengers of his saving doctrine, he left us his Apostles and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and these adorned the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, his Bride, with his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> doctrines. This ornament of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers and the six Ecumenical Councils have preserved inviolate. But the before-mentioned demi-urgos of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> could not endure the sight of this adornment, and gradually brought back <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> under the appearance of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. As then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> armed his Apostles against the ancient <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> with the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and sent them out into all the world, so has he awakened against the new <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> his servants our faithful Emperors, and endowed them with the same wisdom of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Impelled by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> they could no longer be witnesses of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> being laid waste by the deception of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and summoned the sanctified assembly of the God-beloved <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, that they might institute at a synod a scriptural examination into the deceitful colouring of the pictures (<span class="greek">&#x1F41;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03C9;&#x03BC;&#x1F71;&#x03C4;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;</span>) which draws down the spirit of man from the lofty adoration (<span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>) of God to the low and material adoration (<span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>) of the creature, and that they, under divine guidance, might express their view on the subject.</p>

<p>Our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod therefore assembled, and we, its 338 members, follow the older synodal decrees, and accept and proclaim joyfully the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> handed down, principally those of the six <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Ecumenical Synods. In the first place the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical great synod assembled at Nice, etc.</p>

<p>After we had carefully examined their decrees under the guidance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, we found that the unlawful art of painting living creatures <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> the fundamental doctrine of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>&mdash; namely, the Incarnation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and contradicted the six <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synods. These condemned <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> because he divided the one Son and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> into two sons, and on the other side, <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, Dioscorus, Eutyches, and Severus, because they maintained a mingling of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> of the one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>Wherefore we thought it right, to show forth with all accuracy, in our present definition the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of such as make and venerate these, for it is the unanimous doctrine of all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers and of the six Ecumenical Synods, that no one may <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> any kind of separation or mingling in opposition to the unsearchable, unspeakable, and incomprehensible union of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> in the one hypostasis or person. What avails, then, the folly of the painter, who from sinful <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of gain depicts that which should not be depicted&mdash; that is, with his polluted hands he tries to fashion that which should only be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the heart and confessed with the mouth? He makes an image and calls it Christ. The name Christ signifies <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Consequently it is an image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and consequently he has in his foolish <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, in his representation of the created flesh, depicted the Godhead which cannot be represented, and thus mingled what should not be mingled. Thus he is guilty of a double <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>&mdash; the one in making an image of the Godhead, and the other by mingling the Godhead and manhood. Those fall into the same <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> who venerate the image, and the same woe rests upon both, because they <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> with <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, Dioscorus, and Eutyches, and with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01100c.htm">Acephali</a>. When, however, they are blamed for undertaking to depict the divine nature of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which should not be depicted, they take refuge in the excuse: We represent only the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which we have seen and handled. But that is a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For it should be considered that that flesh was also the flesh of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, without any separation, perfectly assumed by the divine nature and made wholly divine. How could it now be separated and represented apart? So is it with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> which mediates between the Godhead of the Son and the dulness of the flesh. As the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh is at the same time flesh of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, so is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, and both at the same time, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being deified as well as the body, and the Godhead remained undivided even in the separation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body in his <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> passion. For where the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is, there is also his Godhead; and where the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is, there too is his Godhead. If then in his passion the divinity remained inseparable from these, how do the fools venture to separate the flesh from the Godhead, and represent it by itself as the image of a mere man? They fall into the abyss of impiety, since they separate the flesh from the Godhead, ascribe to it a subsistence of its own, a personality of its own, which they depict, and thus introduce a fourth person into the Trinity. Moreover, they represent as not being made divine, that which has been made divine by being assumed by the Godhead. Whoever, then, makes an image of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, either depicts the Godhead which cannot be depicted, and mingles it with the manhood (like the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>), or he represents the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as not made divine and separate and as a person apart, like the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>.</p>

<p>The only admissible figure of the humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, however, is bread and wine in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Supper. This and no other form, this and no other type, has he chosen to represent his <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>. Bread he ordered to be brought, but not a representation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form, so that <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> might not arise. And as the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is made divine, so also this figure of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the bread, is made divine by the descent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; it becomes the divine body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by the mediation of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who, separating the oblation from that which is common, sanctifies it.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> custom of assigning names to the images does not come down from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers; nor have these left behind them any <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> by which an image should be hallowed or made anything else than ordinary matter.</p>

<p>If, however, some say, we might be right in regard to the images of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, on account of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> union of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, but it is not right for us to forbid also the images of the altogether spotless and ever-<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, who were mere men and did not consist of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; we may reply, first of all: If those fall away, there is no longer need of these. But we will also consider what may be said against these in particular. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> has rejected the <em>whole</em> of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>, and so not merely <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, but also the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> worship of images. The Saints live on <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although they have died. If anyone thinks to call them back again to life by a dead art, discovered by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, he makes himself guilty of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. Who dares attempt with heathenish art to paint the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, who is exalted above all heavens and the Saints? It is not permitted to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who have the hope of the resurrection, to imitate the customs of <a href="../cathen/04767a.htm">demon-worshippers</a>, and to insult the Saints, who shine in so great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, by common dead matter.</p>

<p>Moreover, we can prove our view by <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and the Fathers. In the former it is said: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;</q> and: <q>You shall not make you any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath;</q> on which account God spoke to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> on the Mount, from the midst of the fire, but showed them no image. Further: <q>They changed the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man,...and served the creature more than the Creator.</q> [<em>Several other passages, even less to the point, are cited</em>.] </p>

<p>The same is taught also by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers. [<em>The Synod appeals to a spurious passage from Epiphanius and to one inserted into the writings of Theodotus of Ancyra, a friend of St. Cyril's; to utterances&mdash; in no way striking&mdash; of Gregory of Nazianzum, of SS. Chrysostom, Basil, Athanasius of Amphilochius and of Eusebius Pamphili, from his</em> Letter to the Empress Constantia, <em>who had asked him for a picture of Christ</em>.] </p>

<p>Supported by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> and the Fathers, we declare unanimously, in the name of the Holy Trinity, that there shall be rejected and removed and cursed out of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Church every likeness which is made out of any material and colour whatever by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> art of painters.</p>

<p>Whoever in future dares to make such a thing, or to venerate it, or set it up in a church, or in a private house, or possesses it in secret, shall, if <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>; if <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematised</a>, and become liable to be tried by the secular <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as an adversary of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and an enemy of the doctrines handed down by the Fathers. At the same time we ordain that no incumbent of a church shall venture, under pretext of destroying the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in regard to images, to lay his hands on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> vessels in order to have them altered, because they are adorned with figures. The same is provided in regard to the vestments of churches, cloths, and all that is dedicated to divine service. If, however, the incumbent of a church wishes to have such church vessels and vestments altered, he must do this only with the assent of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Ecumenical patriarch and at the bidding of our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperors. So also no prince or secular official shall rob the churches, as some have done in former times, under the pretext of destroying images. All this we ordain, believing that we speak as does the Apostle, for we also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we have the spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; and as our predecessors who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the same thing spoke what they had synodically defined, so we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and therefore do we speak, and set forth a definition of what has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to us following and in accordance with the definitions of our Fathers.</p>

<p>(1) If anyone shall not confess, according to the tradition of the Apostles and Fathers, in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> one godhead, nature and substance, will and operation, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and dominion, kingdom and power in three subsistences, that is in their most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Persons, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p>(2) If anyone does not confess that one of the Trinity was made flesh, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p>(3) If anyone does not confess that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, etc.</p>

<p>(4) If anyone does not confess one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, etc.</p>

<p>(5) If anyone does not confess that the flesh of the Lord is life-giving because it is the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, etc.</p>

<p>(10) If anyone ventures to represent the hypostatic union of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> in a picture, and calls it Christ, and thus <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> represents a union of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, etc.!</p>

<p>(12) If anyone separates the one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> into two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and endeavours to represent Him who was born of the Virgin separately, and thus accepts only a relative (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C7;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F75;</span>) union of the natures, etc.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod cried out: Thus we all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, we all are of the same mind. We have all with one voice and voluntarily subscribed. This is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Apostles. Many years to the Emperors!

You have now more firmly proclaimed the inseparability of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>! You have banished all <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>!

Anathema to Germanus, the double-minded, and worshipper of wood! Anathema to George, his associate, to the falsifier of the doctrine of the Fathers! Anathema to Mansur, who has an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> name and Saracen opinions! To the betrayer of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the enemy of the Empire, to the teacher of impiety, the perverter of Scripture, Mansur, <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>! The Trinity has deposed these three! </p>

<h2>The Decree</h2>

<p>(<em>Found in Labbe and Cossart</em>, Concilia. <em>Tom. VII., col. 552</em>.)</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, great, and Ecumenical Synod which by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and Christ-loving Emperors, Constantine and Irene, his mother, was gathered together for the second time at Nice, the illustrious metropolis of Bithynia, in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> church of God which is named Sophia, having followed the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, has defined as follows:</p>

<p>Christ our Lord, who has bestowed upon us the light of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of himself, and has redeemed us from the darkness of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, having espoused to himself the Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without spot or defect, promised that he would so preserve her: and gave his word to this effect to his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> when he said: <q>Lo! I am with you always, even unto the end of the world,</q> which promise he made, not only to them, but to us also who should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in his name through their word. But some, not considering of this gift, and having become fickle through the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of the wily enemy, have fallen from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>; for, withdrawing from the traditions of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they have erred from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and as the proverb says: <q>The husbandmen have gone astray in their own husbandry and have gathered in their hands nothingness,</q> because certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in name only, not in fact, had dared to speak against the God-approved ornament of the sacred monuments, of whom God cries aloud through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>Many pastors have corrupted my vineyard, they have polluted my portion.</q></p>

<p>And, forsooth, following profane men, led astray by their carnal sense, they have <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which he has espoused to himself, and have failed to distinguish between <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and profane, styling the images of our Lord and of his Saints by the same name as the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of diabolical <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. Seeing which things, our Lord God (not willing to behold his people corrupted by such manner of plague) has of his good pleasure called us together, the chief of his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, from every quarter, moved with a divine <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and brought hither by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of our princes, Constantine and Irene, to the end that the traditions of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may receive stability by our common decree. Therefore, with all diligence, making a thorough examination and analysis, and following the trend of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we diminish nought, we add nought, but we preserve unchanged all things which pertain to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and following the Six Ecumenical Synods, especially that which met in this illustrious metropolis of Nice, as also that which was afterwards gathered together in the God-protected Royal City.</p>

<p>We believe...life of the world to come. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </p>

<p>We detest and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and all the sharers of his absurd opinion; also Macedonius and those who following him are well styled <q>Foes of the Spirit</q> (<a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Pneumatomachi</a>). We confess that our Lady, <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">St. Mary</a>, is properly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the Mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because she was the Mother after the flesh of One Person of the Holy Trinity, to wit, Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the Council of Ephesus has already defined when it cast out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the impious <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> with his colleagues, because he taught that there were two Persons [in Christ]. With the Fathers of this synod we confess that he who was incarnate of the immaculate Mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Ever-Virgin Mary has two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, recognizing him as perfect God and perfect man, as also the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> has promulgated, expelling from the divine Atrium [<span class="greek">&#x03B1;&#x1F50;&#x03BB;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2;</span>] as <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a>, Eutyches and Dioscorus; and placing in the same category Severus, Peter and a number of others, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> in various fashions. Moreover, with these we <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> the fables of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Evagrius, and Didymus, in accordance with the decision of the Fifth Council held at Constantinople. We affirm that in Christ there be two wills and two operations according to the reality of each nature, as also the Sixth Synod, held at Constantinople, taught, casting out Sergius, Honorius, Cyrus, Pyrrhus, Macarius, and those who agree with them, and all those who are unwilling to be reverent.</p>

<p>To make our confession short, we keep unchanged all the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical traditions</a> handed down to us, whether in writing or verbally, one of which is the making of pictorial representations, agreeable to the history of the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, a tradition useful in many respects, but especially in this, that so the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is shown forth as real and not merely phantastic, for these have mutual indications and without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> have also mutual significations.</p>

<p>We, therefore, following the royal pathway and the divinely inspired authority of our Holy Fathers and the traditions of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (for, as we all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> indwells her), define with all certitude and accuracy that just as the figure of the precious and life-giving Cross, so also the venerable and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> images, as well in painting and mosaic as of other fit materials, should be set forth in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and on the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> and on the vestments and on hangings and in pictures both in houses and by the wayside, to wit, the figure of our Lord God and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, of our spotless Lady, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> Angels, of all Saints and of all <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> people. For by so much more frequently as they are seen in artistic representation, by so much more readily are men lifted up to the memory of their prototypes, and to a longing after them; and to these should be given due salutation and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> reverence (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C3;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03BC;&#x1F78;&#x03BD; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BC;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x1F7B;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>), not indeed that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worship of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>) which pertains alone to the divine nature; but to these, as to the figure of the precious and life-giving Cross and to the Book of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and to the other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> objects, <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> and lights may be offered according to ancient <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> custom. For the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which is paid to the image passes on to that which the image represents, and he who reveres the image reveres in it the subject represented. For thus the teaching of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, that is the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which from one end of the earth to the other has received the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, is strengthened. Thus we follow <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who spoke in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the whole divine Apostolic company and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, holding fast the traditions which we have received. So we sing <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> the triumphal <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <q>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion; Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem. Rejoice and be glad with all your heart. The Lord has taken away from you the oppression of your adversaries; you are redeemed from the hand of your enemies. The Lord is a King in the midst of you; you shall not see <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> any more, and peace be unto you forever.</q></p>

<p>Those, therefore who dare to think or teach otherwise, or as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to spurn the traditions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to invent some novelty, or else to reject some of those things which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has received (<em>e.g.</em>, the Book of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, or the image of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, or the pictorial icons, or the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>), or evilly and sharply to devise anything subversive of the lawful traditions of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or to turn to common uses the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> or the venerable <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>,  if they be Bishops or Clerics, we command that they be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>; if religious or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laics</a>, that they be cut off from communion.</p>

<p>[<em>After all had signed, the acclamations began</em> (col. 576).]</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod cried out: So we all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, we all are so minded, we all give our consent and have signed. This is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Apostles, this is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, this is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which has made firm the whole world. Believing in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be celebrated in Trinity, we salute the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> images! Those who do not so hold, let them be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. Those who do not thus think, let them be driven far away from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For we follow the most ancient legislation of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. We keep the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Fathers. We <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> those who add anything to or take anything away from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church. We <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> the introduced novelty of the revilers of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. We salute the venerable images. We place under <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> those who do not do this.

Anathema to those who do not salute the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and venerable images. Anathema to those who call the sacred images <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.

<p>Many years to the Emperors, etc., etc.</p>

<h2>The Canons</h2> 

<h3>Canon 1</h3>

<p> <em>That the sacred Canons are in all things to be observed.</em></p>

<p>The pattern for those who have received the sacerdotal dignity is found in the testimonies and instructions laid down in the canonical constitutions, which we receiving with a glad <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, sing unto the Lord God in the words of the God-inspired David, saying: <q>I have had as great delight in the way of your testimonies as in all manner of riches.</q> <q>You have commanded righteousness as your testimonies for ever.</q> <q>Grant me understanding and I shall live.</q> Now if the word of prophesy bids us keep the testimonies of God forever and to live by them, it is evident that they must abide unshaken and without change. Therefore <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, speaks after this manner: <q>To them nothing is to be added, and from them nothing is to be taken away.</q> And the divine Apostle glorying in them cries out, <q>which things the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> desire to look into,</q> and, <q>if an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> preach to you anything besides that which you have received, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</q> Seeing these things are so, being thus well-testified unto us, we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over them as he that has found great spoil, and press to our bosom with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> the divine canons, holding fast all the precepts of the same, complete and without change, whether they have been set forth by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> trumpets of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the renowned Apostles, or by the Six Ecumenical Councils, or by Councils locally assembled for promulgating the decrees of the said Ecumenical Councils, or by our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers. For all these, being illumined by the same Spirit, defined such things as were expedient. Accordingly those whom they placed under <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, we likewise <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a>; those whom they deposed, we also depose; those whom they <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, we also excommunicate; and those whom they delivered over to punishment, we subject to the same penalty. And now <q>let your conversation be without <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>,</q> cries out <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the divine Apostle, who was caught up into the third heaven and heard unspeakable words.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: We gladly embrace the Divine Canons, viz.: those of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Holy Apostles</a>, of the Six Ecumenical Synods, as also of the local synods and of our Holy Fathers, as inspired by one and the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Whom they <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> we also <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a>; whom they depose, we depose; whom they cut off, we cut off; and whom they subject to penalties, we also so subject.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 2</h3>

<p> <em>That he who is to be ordained a Bishop must be steadfastly resolved to observe the canons, otherwise he shall not be ordained.</em></p>

<p>When we recite the psalter, we promise God: <q>I will meditate upon your statutes, and will not forget your words.</q> It is a salutary thing for all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to observe this, but it is especially incumbent upon those who have received the sacerdotal dignity. Therefore we decree, that every one who is raised to the rank of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the psalter by heart, so that from it he may admonish and instruct all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who are subject to him. And diligent examination shall be made by the metropolitan whether he be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> inclined to read diligently, and not merely now and then, the sacred canons, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and the book of the divine Apostle, and all other <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>; and whether he lives according to God's commandments, and also teaches the same to his people. For the special treasure (<span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>) of our <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priesthood</a> is the oracles which have been divinely delivered to us, that is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> science of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>, as says Dionysius the Great. And if his mind be not set, and even glad, so to do and teach, let him not be ordained. For says God by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>You have rejected <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, I will also reject you, that you shall be no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to me.</q></p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: Whoever is to be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Psalter by heart: he must thoroughly understand what he reads, and not merely superficially, but with diligent care, that is to say the Sacred Canons, the Holy <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, the book of the Apostle, and the whole of the Divine Scripture. And should he not have such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he is not to be ordained.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 3</h3>

<p> <em>That it does not pertain to princes to choose a Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Let every election of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, made by princes stand null, according to the canon which says: If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> making use of the secular powers shall by their means obtain jurisdiction over any church, he shall be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, and also <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, together with all who remain in communion with him. For he who is raised to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> must be chosen by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as was decreed by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers of Nice in the canon which says: It is most fitting that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be ordained by all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the province; but if this is difficult to arrange, either on account of urgent necessity, or because of the length of the journey, three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at least having met together and given their votes, those also who are absent having signified their assent by letters, the ordination shall take place. The confirmation of what is thus done, shall in each province be given by the metropolitan thereof.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: Every election made by a secular magistrate is null.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 4</h3>

<p> <em>That Bishops are to abstain from all receiving of gifts.</em></p>

<p>The Church's herald, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the divine Apostle, laying down a rule (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;</span>) not only for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of Ephesus but for the whole company of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, speaks thus explicitly, saying, <q>I have <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> no man's silver or gold, or apparel. I have showed you all things, how that so labouring you ought to support the weak;</q> for he accounted it more blessed to give. Therefore we being taught by him do decree, that under no circumstances, shall a Bishop for the sake of filthy lucre invent feigned excuses for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and exact gold or silver or other gifts from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who are subject to him. For says the Apostle, <q>The unrighteous shall not possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>,</q> and, <q>The children ought not to lay up for the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> for the children.</q> If then any is found, who for the sake of exacting gold or any other gift, or who from personal feeling, has suspended from the ministry, or even <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, any of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> subject to his jurisdiction, or who has closed any of the venerable temples, so that the service of God may not be celebrated in it, pouring out his <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> even upon things insensible, and thus showing himself to be without understanding, he shall be subjected to the same punishment he devised for others, and his trouble shall return on his own head, as a transgressor of God's commandment and of the apostolic precepts. For Peter the supreme head (<span class="greek">&#x1F21; &#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03C5;&#x03C6;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;&#x03B1; &#x1F00;&#x03BA;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C2;</span>) of the Apostles commands, <q>Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD; &#x03BA;&#x03BB;&#x1F75;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;</span> [A.V. God's heritage]); but being ensamples to the flock. And when the chief shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that fades not away.</q></p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: We decree that no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall extort gold or silver, or anything else from <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> subject to his jurisdiction. And if anyone through the power of gold or of any other thing or through his own whims, shall be found to have prevented any one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who are subject to him, from the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> offices, or shall have shut up a venerable temple so that the sacred worship of God could not be performed in it, he shall be subject to the lex talionis. For Peter the Apostle says: Feed the flock of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not of necessity but willingly, and according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not for filthy lucre's sake, but with a prompt mind; not exercising lordship over the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but being an example to the flock.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 5</h3>

<p> <em>That they who cast contumely upon <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> because they have been ordained in the church without bringing a gift with them, are to be published with a fine.</em></p>

<p>It is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unto death when men incorrigibly continue in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> more deeply, who proudly lifting themselves up oppose <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and sincerity, accounting <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of more worth than <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and caring nothing for his canonical precepts. The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> is not found among such, unless, perchance, having been humbled by their own fall, they return to a sober mind. It behooves them the rather to turn to God with a contrite heart and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for forgiveness and pardon of so grave a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and no longer to boast in an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> gift. For the Lord is near unto them that are of a contrite heart. With regard, therefore, to those who <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves that because of their benefactions of gold they were ordained in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and resting confidently in this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> custom (so alien from God and inconsistent with the whole <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>), with a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> look and open mouth vilify with abusive words those who on account of the strictness of their life were chosen by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and have been ordained without any gift of money, we decree in the first place that they take the lowest place in their order; but if they do not amend let them be subjected to a fine. But if it appear that any one has done this [i.e., given money], at any time as a price for ordination, let him be dealt with according to the Apostolic Canon which says: <q>If a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has obtained possession of his dignity by means of money (the same rule applies also to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>) let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> and also the one who ordained him, and let him also be altogether cut off from communion, even as <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> was by me Peter.</q> To the same effect is the second canon of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers of Chalcedon, which says: If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gives ordination in return for money, and puts up for sale that which cannot be sold, and ordains for money a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or any other of those who are reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; or who for money shall appoint anyone to the office of &oelig;conomus, advocate, or paramonarius; or, in a word, who has done anything else contrary to the canon, for the sake of filthy lucre&mdash; he who has undertaken to do anything of this sort, having been convicted, shall be in danger of losing his degree. And he who has been ordained shall derive no advantage from the ordination or promotion thus negotiated; but let him remain a stranger to the dignity and responsibility which he attained by means of money. And if any one shall appear to have acted as a go-between in so shameful and godless a traffic, he also, if he be a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, shall be removed from his degree; if he be a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> or a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: It seems that such as <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the fact that they owe their position to their liberality in gold to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and who contemn those who were chosen because of their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and were appointed without any largess, should receive the lowest place in their order. And should they continue in their ways, let them be punished. But those who made such gifts so as to get ordinations, let such be cast forth from communion, as <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> was by Peter.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 6</h3>

<p> <em>Concerning the holding of a local Synod at the time appointed.</em></p>

<p>Since there is a canon which says, twice a year in each province, the canonical enquiries shall be made in the gatherings of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; but because of the inconveniences which those who thus came together had to undergo in travelling, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers of the Sixth Council decreed that once each year, without regard to place or excuse which might be urged, a council should be held and the things which are amiss corrected. This canon we now renew. And if any prince be found hindering this being carried out, let him be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. But if any of the metropolitans shall take no care that this be done, he being free from constraint or <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or other reasonable excuse, let him be subjected to the canonical penalties. While the council is engaged in considering the canons or matters which have regard to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, it behooves the assembled Bishops, with all attention and grave thought to guard the divine and life-giving commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for in keeping of them there is great reward; because our lamp is the commandment, and our light is the law, and trial and discipline are the way of life, and the commandment of the Lord shining afar gives light to the eyes. It is not permitted to a metropolitan to demand any of those things which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> bring with them, whether it be a horse or any other gift. If he be convicted of doing anything of this sort, he shall restore fourfold.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: Whenever it is not possible for a synod to meet according to the decree formulated long ago, twice in each year, at least let it be held once, as seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the Sixth Synod. Should any magistrate forbid such meeting, let him be cast out: and a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who shall take no pains to assemble it, shall be subject to punishment. And when the synod is held, should it appear that the Metropolitan has taken anything away from any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, let him restore four-fold.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 7</h3>

<p> <em>That to churches <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> without any deposit of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the Saints, the defect should be made good.</em></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the divine Apostle says: <q>The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of some are open beforehand, and some they follow after.</q> These are their primary <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> follow these. Accordingly upon the heels of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the traducers of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, there followed close other ungodliness. For as they took out of the churches the presence of the venerable images, so likewise they cast aside other customs which we must now revive and maintain in accordance with the written and unwritten law. We decree therefore that relics shall be placed with the accustomed service in as many of the sacred temples as have been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> without the relics of the Martyrs. And if any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from this time forward is found consecrating a temple without <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> relics, he shall be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, as a transgressor of the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical traditions</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: Let <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the Holy Martyrs be placed in such churches as have been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> without them, and this with the accustomed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. But whoever shall consecrate a church without these shall be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> as a transgressor of the traditions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 8</h3>

<p> <em>That Hebrews ought not to be received unless they have been converted in sincerity of heart.</em></p>

<p>Since certain, erring in the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a> of the Hebrews, have thought to mock at Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and feigning to be converted to the religion of Christ do deny him, and in private and secretly keep the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> and observe other Jewish customs, we decree that such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> be not received to communion, nor to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, nor into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but let them be openly Hebrews according to their religion, and let them not bring their children to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, nor purchase or possess a slave. But if any of them, out of a sincere heart and in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is converted and makes profession with his whole heart, setting at naught their customs and observances, and so that others may be convinced and converted, such an one is to be received and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and his children likewise; and let them be taught to take care to hold aloof from the ordinances of the Hebrews. But if they will not do this, let them in no way be received.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: Hebrews must not be received unless they are manifestly converted with sincerity of heart.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 9</h3>

<p> <em>That none of the books containing the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the traducers of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are to be hid.</em></p>

<p>All the childish devices and mad ravings which have been <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> written against the venerable images, must be delivered up to the Episcopium of Constantinople, that they may be locked away with other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> books. And if anyone is found hiding such books, if he be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>; but if he be a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: If any one is found to have concealed a book written against the venerable images, if he is on the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> list let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>; if a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> or <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> let him be cut off.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 10</h3>

<p> <em>That no <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> ought to leave his diocese and go into another without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Bishop.</em></p>

<p>Since certain of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, misinterpreting the canonical constitutions, leave their own diocese and run into other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, especially into this God-protected royal city, and take up their abode with princes, celebrating liturgies in their <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, it is not permitted to receive such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> into any house or church without the license of their own Bishop and also that of the Bishop of Constantinople. And if any clerk shall do this without such license, and shall so continue, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>. With regard to those who have done this with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the aforesaid Bishops, it is not lawful for them to undertake mundane and secular responsibilities, since this is forbidden by the sacred canons. And if anyone is discovered holding the office of those who are called Meizoteroi; let him either lay it down, or be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Let him rather be the instructor of the children and others of the household, reading to them the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>, for to this end he received the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: A <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> who after leaving his own parish has settled in another far off from his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople, shall be received neither into house nor church. And if he shall persevere in his course, he shall be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>. But if they shall do this with a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what we have said, they shall not receive a secular position; or should they have received them, they shall cease from them. And if they refuse they shall be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 11</h3>

<p> <em>That &OElig;conomi ought to be in the Episcopal palaces and in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">Monasteries</a>.</em></p>

<p>Since we are under obligation to guard all the divine canons, we ought by all means to maintain in its integrity that one which says &oelig;conomi are to be in each church. If the metropolitan appoints in his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> an &oelig;conomus, he does well; but if he does not, it is permitted to the Bishop of Constantinople by his own (<span class="greek">&#x1F30;&#x03B4;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>) authority to choose an &oelig;conomus for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Metropolitan. A like authority belongs to the metropolitans, if the Bishops who are subject to them do not wish to appoint &oelig;conomi in their churches. The same rule is also to be observed with respect to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: If the Metropolitan does not elect an &oelig;conomus of the metropolis, the patriarch shall do so. If the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall not do so, the Metropolitan shall; for so it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the fathers assembled at Chalcedon. The same law shall hold in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 12</h3>

<p> <em>That a Bishop or Hegumenos ought not to alienate any part of the suburban estate of the church.</em></p>

<p>If <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <em><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">hegumenos</a></em> is found alienating any part of the farm lands of the bishoprick or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> into the hands of secular princes, or surrendering them to any other person, such act is null according to the canon of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles, which says: <q>Let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> take care of all the Church's goods, and let him administer the same according as in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> It is not lawful for him to appropriate any part himself, or to confer upon his relations the things which belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If they are poor let them be helped among the poor; but let them not be used as a pretext for smuggling away the Church's property. And if it be urged that the land is only a loss and yields no profit, the place is not on that account to be given to the secular rulers, who are in the neighbourhood; but let it be given to clergymen or husbandmen. And if they have resorted to dishonest craft, so that the ruler has bought the land from the husbandman or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, such transaction shall likewise be null, and the land shall be restored to the bishoprick or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <em><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">hegumenos</a></em> doing this shall be turned out, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from his bishoprick and the <em><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">hegumenos</a></em> from his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, as those who wasted what they did not gather.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: According to what seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Holy Apostles</a>, any act of alienation of the goods of a diocese or of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> made by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or by the superior of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, shall be null.

<p>During the calamity which was brought to pass in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, because of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, some of the sacred houses, for example, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> palaces and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, were seized by certain men and became public inns. If those who now hold them choose to give them back, so that they may be restored to their original use, well and good; but if not, and these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are on the sacerdotal list, we command that they be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>; if they be <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, that they be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, as those who have been condemned from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and assigned their place where the worm dies not and the fire is not quenched, because they set themselves against the voice of the Lord, which says: <q>Make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</q></p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: Those who make common diocesan or monastic goods, unless they restore to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or superior the things belonging to the diocese or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, the whole proceeding shall be null. If they are <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in Holy Orders they shall be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, but if <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> or <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> they shall be cast out.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 14</h3>

<p> <em>That no one without ordination ought to read in the <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a> during the synaxis.</em></p>

<p>That there is a certain order established in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is very evident to all, and to guard diligently the promotions of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is well pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Since therefore we see certain youths who have received the clerical <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, but who have not yet received ordination from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, reading in the <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a> during the Synaxis, and in doing this violating the canons, we forbid this to be done (from henceforth,) and let this prohibition be observed also among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. It is permitted to each <em><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">hegumenos</a></em> in his own <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to ordain a reader, if he himself had received the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the dignity of <em><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">hegumenos</a></em>, and is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. Chorepiscopi may likewise, according to ancient custom and with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> authorization, appoint readers. </p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: No one shall read from the ambon unless he has been ordained by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. And this shall be in force also among <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The superior of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, if he has been ordained by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, may ordain a lector but only in his own <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. A <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a> also can make a lector.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 15</h3>

<p> <em>That a clerk ought not to be set over two churches.</em></p>

<p>From henceforth no <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> shall be appointed over two churches, for this savours of merchandise and filthy lucre, and is altogether alien from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> custom. We have heard by the very voice of the Lord that, <q>No man can serve two masters, for either he will <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the one and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other.</q> Each one, therefore, as says the Apostle, in the calling wherein he was called, in the same he ought to abide, and in one only church to give attendance. For in the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, what is gained through filthy lucre is altogether separate from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To meet the necessities of this life, there are various occupations, by means of which, if one so desire, let him procure the things needful for the body. For says the Apostle, <q>These hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.</q> Occupations of this sort may be obtained in the God-protected city. But in the country places outside, because of the small number of people, let a dispensation be granted.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: Hereafter at Constantinople a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> may not serve two churches. But in the outskirts this may be permitted on account of the scarcity of men.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 16</h3>

<p> <em>That it does not become one in holy orders to be clad in costly apparel.</em></p>

<p>All buffoonery and decking of the body ill becomes the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> rank. Therefore those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who array themselves in gay and showy clothing ought to correct themselves, and if they do not amend they ought to be subjected to punishment. So likewise they who anoint themselves with perfumes. When the root of bitterness sprang up, there was poured into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the pollution of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the traducers of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. And such as were defiled by it, not only detested the pictured images, but also set at naught all decorum, being exceedingly mad against those who lived gravely and religiously; so that in them was fulfilled that which is written, <q>The service of God is abominable to the sinner.</q> If therefore, any are found deriding those who are clad in poor and grave raiment, let them be corrected by punishment. For from early times every man in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders wore modest and grave clothing; and verily whatever is worn, not so much because of necessity, as for the sake of outward show, savours of dandyism, as says <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil the Great</a>. Nor did anyone array himself in raiment embroidered with silk, nor put many coloured ornaments on the border of his garments; for they had heard from the lips of God that <q>They that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.</q></p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: Bishops and clergymen arraying themselves in splendid clothes and anointed with perfumes must be corrected. Should they persist, they must be punished.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 17</h3>

<p> <em>That he shall not be allowed to begin the building of an oratory, who has not the means wherewith to finish it.</em></p>

<p>Certain <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> having left their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> because they desired to rule, and, unwilling to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, are undertaking to build <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, but have not the means to finish them. Now whoever shall undertake to do anything of this sort, let him be forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the place. But if he have the means wherewith to finish, let what he has designed be carried on to completion. The same rule is to be observed with regard to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: Whoever wishes to build a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, if he has the wherewithal to finish it, let him begin the work, and let him bring it to a conclusion. But if not, let him be prohibited by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the place. The same law shall apply to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 18</h3>

<p> <em>That <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> ought not to live in <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> houses, nor in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of men.</em></p>

<p><q>Be without offense to those who are without,</q> says the divine Apostle. Now for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to live in Bishops' houses or in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> is ground for grave offense. Whoever therefore is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have a female slave or freewoman in the episcopal palace or in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for the discharge of some service, let him be rebuked. And if he still continue to retain her, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>. If it happens that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are on the suburban estates, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <em><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">hegumenos</a></em> desires to go there, so long as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <em><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">hegumenos</a></em> is present, let no <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> at that time continue her work, but let her betake herself to some other place until the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> [or <em><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">hegumenos</a></em> ] has departed, so that there be no occasion of complaint.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: It is not fitting that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> should be kept in episcopal houses or in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. If anyone shall dare to do so, he shall be reproved; but if he persists, he shall be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>. No <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is allowed to serve or even to appear where a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or a superior of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is present, but let her keep herself apart until he be gone.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 19</h3>

<p> <em>That the vows of those in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders and of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> are to be made without the exaction of gifts.</em></p>

<p>The abomination of filthy lucre has made such inroads among the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, that certain of those who call themselves religious men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, forgetting the commandments of the Lord have been altogether led astray, and for the sake of money have received those presenting themselves for the sacerdotal order and the monastic life. And hence the first step of those so received being unlawful, the whole proceeding is rendered null, as says Basil the Great. For it is not possible that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be served by means of <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>.  If therefore, anyone is found doing anything of this kind, if he be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <em><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">hegumenos</a></em>, or one of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, either let him cease to do so any longer or else let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, according to the second canon of the Holy <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. If the offender be an abbess, let her be sent away from her <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and placed in another in a subordinate position. In like manner is a <em><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">hegumenos</a></em> to be dealt with, who has not the ordination of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. With regard to what has been given by <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> as a dowry for their children, or which <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> themselves have contributed out of their own property, with the declaration that such gifts were made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we have decreed, that whether the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in whose behalf the gifts were made, continue to live in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> or not, the gifts are to remain with the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in accordance with their first determination; unless indeed there be ground for complaint against the superior.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: Whoever for money admits those coming to Holy Orders or to the monastic life, if he be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or superior of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> or any other in sacred orders, shall either cease or be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>. And the Superior of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> shall be expelled [if she have done so] and shall be given over to subjection. The same shall be the case with a superior of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, if he be not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. But the possessions brought by those who come in, let them remain, whether the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> remain or not, provided the superior be not to blame.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 20</h3>

<p> <em>That from henceforth, no double <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> shall be erected; and concerning the double <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> already in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.</em></p>

<p>We decree that from henceforth, no double <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> shall be erected; because this has become an offense and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of complaint to many. In the case of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who with the members of their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> propose to leave the world and follow the monastic life, let the men go into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for men, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; for this is well-pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The double <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which are already in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, shall observe the rule of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Father Basil, and shall be ordered by his precepts, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> shall not dwell together in the same <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, for in thus living together <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> finds its occasion. No <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> shall have access to a nunnery; nor shall a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> be permitted to enter a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for the sake of conversing with anyone therein. No <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> shall sleep in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, nor eat alone with a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>.  When food is brought by men to the <a href="../cathen/03255b.htm">canonesses</a>, let the abbess accompanied by some one of the aged <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, receive it outside the gates of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. When a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> desires to see one of his kinswomen, who may be in the nunnery, let him converse with her in the presence of the abbess, and that in a very few words, and then let him speedily take his departure.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">Monasteries</a> shall not be <a href="../cathen/10452a.htm">double</a>, neither shall <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> live in the same building, nor shall they talk together apart.

<h3>Canon 21</h3>

<p> <em>That <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> are not to leave their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and go into others.</em></p>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> or <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> ought not to leave the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to which he or she is attached, and betake themselves to others. But if one do this, he ought to be received as a guest. It is not however proper that he be made a member of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, without the consent of his <em><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">hegumenos</a></em>.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: It is not allowed to a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> or a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> to leave her own house and enter another; but if he (or she) enters let (him or her) be received as a guest; but let him (or her) not be admitted at all nor given hospitality contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the superior.</em></p>

<h3>Canon 22</h3>

<p> <em>That when it happens that <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> have to eat with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> they ought to observe giving of thanks, and abstemiousness, and discretion.</em></p>

<p>To surrender all things to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not to serve our own wills, is great gain. For says the divine Apostle, <q>whether you eat or drink, do all to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And Christ our God has bidden us in his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, to cut off the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for not only is <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> rebuked by him, but even the movement of the mind towards the act of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> when he says, <q>Whosoever looks on a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after her, has committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with her already in his heart.</q> We who have been thus taught ought therefore to purify our minds. Now although all things are lawful, all things are not expedient, as we have been taught by the mouth of the Apostle. It is needful that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should eat in order that they may live. And for those to whom life consists of marrying, and bringing forth children, and of the condition of the lay state, there is nothing unbecoming in men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> eating together, only let them give thanks to the giver of the food; but if there be the entertainments of the theatre, that is, Satanic songs accompanied with the meretricious inflections of harps, there come upon them, through these things, the curse of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, who thus speaks: <q>Woe to them who drink wine with harp and psaltery, but they regard not the works of the Lord, and consider not the works of his hands.</q> Whenever <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of this sort are found among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, let them amend their ways; but if they will not do so, let there overtake them the penalties which have been enacted in the canons by our predecessors. With regard to those whose life is free from care and apart from men, that is, those who have resolved before the Lord God to carry the solitary yoke, they should sit down alone and in silence. Moreover it is also altogether unlawful for those who have chosen the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> life to eat in private with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, unless it be with God-fearing and discreet men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, so that even their feast may be turned to spiritual edification. The same rule is to be observed with <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>. Again, if it happen that a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> while on a journey does not have with him what is absolutely necessary for him, and, because of his pressing needs, thinks well to turn aside into an inn or into someone's house, this he is permitted to do, seeing that need compels.</p>

<p> <em>Ancient Epitome: There is no objection to laywomen eating with men: it is not right however for men who have chosen the lonely life, to eat privately with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; unless perchance together with them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God and with religious men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.

<h2>The Letter of the Synod to the Emperor and Empress</h2>

<p>(Labbe and Cossart, <em>Concilia</em>, Tom. VII., col. 577.)</p>

<p>To our most religious and most serene princes, Constantine and Irene his mother. <a href="../cathen/14451b.htm">Tarasius</a>, the unworthy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of your God-protected royal city, <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">new Rome</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Council which met at the good pleasure of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and upon the command of your Christ-loving majesty in the renowned metropolis of Nice, the second council to assemble in this city.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our God (who is the head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>) was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, most noble princes, when your heart, which he holds in his hands, gave forth that good word bidding us to assemble in his name, in order that we might strengthen our hold on the sure, immovable, and God-given <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> contained in the Church's <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>. As your heads were crowned with gold and most brilliant stones, so likewise were your minds adorned with the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and the teachings of the Fathers. And being the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and companions, as it were, of those whose sounds went forth into all the earth, you became the leaders in the way of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of all who bore the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, setting forth clearly the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and giving a brilliant example of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; so that you were to the faithful as so many burning lamps. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which was ready to fall, you upheld with your hands, strengthening it with sound doctrine, and bringing into the unity of a right judgment those who were at variance. We may therefore well say with boldness that it was through you that the good pleasure of God brought about the triumph of godliness, and filled our mouth with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and our tongue with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>. And these things our lips utter with a formal decree. For what is more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> than to maintain the Church's interests; and what else is more calculated to provoke our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>?</p>

<p>Certain men rose up, having the form of godliness, inasmuch as they were clothed with the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, but denying the power thereof; and thus deserving for themselves the charge of being but <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>. Of such the word of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> had before declared that <q>lawlessness went forth from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>  of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>.</q> Nay more, they banded themselves together in a sanhedrim, like to that which <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> held, and became the propagators of ungodly doctrines. And having a mouth full of cursing and bitterness, they thought to win the mastery by means of abusive words. With a <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> tongue and a pen of a like character, and objecting to the very terms used by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> himself, they devised marvellous tales, and then proceeded to stigmatise as idolaters the royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation, even those who had put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and by his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> had been kept safe from the folly of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. And having a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> set upon <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, they took in hand unlawful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, thinking to suppress altogether the depicting of the venerable images. Accordingly, as many icons as were set in mosaic work they dug out, and those which were in painted waxwork, they scraped away; thus turning the comely beauty of the sacred temples into complete disorder. Among doings of this sort, it is to be specially noted that the pictures set up on tablets in memory of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our God and of his Saints, they gave over to the flames. Finally, in a word, having desecrated our churches, they reduced them to utter confusion. Then some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> became the leaders of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and where before was peace, they fomented strife among the people; and instead of wheat sowed tares in the Church's fields. They mingled wine with water, and gave the foul draught to those about them. Although but <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> wolves, they hid themselves under sheeps' clothing, and by specious reasoning against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> sought to commend their lie. But all the while <q>they hatched asps' eggs and wove a spider's web,</q> as says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; and <q>he that would eat of their eggs, having crushed one, found it to be addled, with a basilisk within it,</q> and giving forth a deadly stench.</p>

<p>In such a state of affairs, with a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> busy destroying the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, you, most gracious and most noble princes, did not idly allow so grave a plague, and such soul-destroying <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> long to continue in your day. But moved by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">divine Spirit</a> which abides in you, you set yourselves with all your strength utterly to exterminate it, and thus preserve the stability of the Church's government, and likewise concord among your subjects; so that your whole empire might be established in peace agreeably with the name [Irene] you bear. You rightly reasoned, that it was not to be patiently endured, that while in other matters we could be of one mind and live in concord, yet in what ought to be the chief concern of our life, the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, there was among us strife and division. And that too, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> being our head, we ought to be members one of another, and one body, by our mutual agreement and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Accordingly, you commanded our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and numerously-attended council to assemble in the metropolis of Nice, in order that after having rid the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of division, we might restore to unity the separated members, and might be careful to rend and utterly destroy the coarse cloak of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a>, which they had woven of thorn fibre, and unfold again the fair robe of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>.</p>

<p>And now having carefully traced the traditions of the Apostles and Fathers, we are bold to speak. Having but one mind by the inbreathing of the most <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and being all knit together in one, and understanding the harmonious tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we are in perfect harmony with the symphonies set forth by the six, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical councils; and accordingly we have <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematised</a> the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, the frenzy of Macedonius, the senseless understanding of Appolinarius, the man-worship of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, the irreverent mingling of the natures devised by Eutyches and Dioscorus, and the many-headed hydra which is their companion. We have also <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematised</a> the idle tales of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Didymus, and Evagrius; and the doctrine of one will held by Sergius, Honorius, Cyrus, and Pyrrhus, or rather, we have <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematised</a> their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will. Finally, taught by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, from whom we have drawn pure water, we have with one accord and one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, altogether wiped out with the sponge of the divine <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> the newly devised <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, well-worthy to be classed with those just mentioned, which springing up after them, uttered such empty nonsense about the sacred icons. And the contrivers of this vain, but revolutionary babbling we have cast forth far from the Church's precincts.</p>

<p>And as the hands and feet are moved in accordance with the directions of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so likewise, we, having received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and strength of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and having also the assistance and co-operation of your royal authority, have with one voice declared as <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and proclaimed as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: that the sacred icons of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> are to be had and retained, inasmuch as he was very man; also those which set forth what is historically narrated in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>; and those which represent our undefiled Lady, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>; and likewise those of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Holy Angels</a> (for they have manifested themselves in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> to those who were counted worthy of the vision of them), or of any of the Saints. [We have also decreed] that the brave <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the Saints be portrayed on tablets and on the walls, and upon the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> and vestments, as has been the custom of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of God from ancient times; which custom was regarded as having the force of law in the teaching both of those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> leaders who lived in the first ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and also of their successors our reverend Fathers. [We have likewise decreed] that these images are to be reverenced (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03BD;</span>), that is, salutations are to be offered to them. The reason for using the word is, that it has a two-fold signification. For <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03BD;</span> in the old Greek tongue signifies both <q>to salute</q> and <q>to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>.</q> And the preposition <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span> gives to it the additional idea of strong desire towards the subject; as for example, we have <span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x1F73;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03C6;&#x1F73;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1FF6;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1FF6;</span>, and so also we have <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x1F73;&#x03C9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x1F73;&#x03C9;</span>. Which last word implies salutation and strong <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; for that which one loves he also reverences (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;</span>) and what he reverences that he greatly loves, as the everyday custom, which we observe towards those we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and in which both ideas are practically illustrated when two friends meet together. The word is not only made use of by us, but we also find it set down in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a> by the ancients. For it is written in the histories of the Kings, <q>And David rose up and fell upon his face and did reverence to (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x1F75;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;</span>) Jonathan three times and kissed him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ki020.htm#verse41">1 Kings 20:41</a></span>. And what is it that the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says concerning the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>? <q>They <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the uppermost rooms at feasts and greetings (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C3;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x1F7A;&#x03C2;</span>) in the markets.</q> It is evident that by <q>greetings</q> here, he means reverence (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x1F7B;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>) for the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> being very high-minded and thinking themselves to be righteous were eager to be reverenced by all, but not [merely] to be kissed. For to receive salutations of this latter sort savoured too much of lowly humility, and this was not to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees'</a> liking. We have also the example of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the divine Apostle, as Luke in the Acts of the Apostles relates: <q>When we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly, and the day following <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> went in with us unto James, and all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> were present. And when he had saluted (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C3;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x1F71;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> by his ministry</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act021.htm#verse17">Acts 21:17-19</a></span>. By the salutation here mentioned, the Apostle evidently intended to render that reverence of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BC;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x1F7B;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>) which we show to one another, and of which he speaks when he says concerning Jacob, that <q>he reverenced (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03BA;&#x1F7B;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;</span>) the top of his staff</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse21">Hebrews 11:21</a></span>. With these examples agrees what Gregory surnamed Theologus says: <q>Honour <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and reverence (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x1F75;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>) the <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>.</q></p>

<p>Now who of those rightly and sincerely understanding the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>, has ever supposed that these examples which we have cited speak of the worship in spirit (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x1F10;&#x03BD; &#x03C0;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x1F7B;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B9; &#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>)? [Certainly no one has ever thought so] except perhaps some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> utterly bereft of sense and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and of the teaching of the Fathers. Surely Jacob did not adore (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03BB;&#x1F71;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;</span>) the top of his staff; and surely <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory Theologus</a> does not bid us to adore (<span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1F7B;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>) the <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>? By no means.</p>

<p>Again, when offering salutations to the life-giving Cross, we together sing: <q>We reverence (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x1FF6;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;</span>), your cross, O Lord, and we also reverence (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x1FF6;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;</span>) the spear which opened the life-giving side of your goodness.</q> This is clearly but a salutation, and is so called, and its character is evinced by our touching the things mentioned with our lips. We grant that the word <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x1F7B;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span> is frequently found in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a> and in the writings of our learned and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers for the worship in spirit (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x1F76; &#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C2; &#x1F10;&#x03BD; &#x03C0;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x1F7B;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B9; &#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>), since, being a word of many significations, it may be used to express that kind of reverence which is service. As there is also the veneration of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. In this sense it is, that we venerate your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and most noble majesty. So also there is another veneration which comes of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> alone, thus Jacob venerated <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>. Then there is the veneration of gratitude, as <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> reverenced the <a href="../cathen/07305a.htm">sons of Heth</a>, for the field which he received from them for a burying place for Sarah his wife. And finally, those looking to obtain some gift, venerate those who are above them, as Jacob venerated <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>. Therefore because this term has these many significations, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a> teaching us, <q>You shall venerate the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and him only shall you serve,</q> says simply that veneration is to be given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but does not add the word <q>only;</q> for veneration being a word of wide meaning is an ambiguous term; but it goes on to say <q>you shall serve (<span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1F7B;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>) him only,</q> for to God alone do we render <em><a href="../cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a></em>.</p>

<p>The things which we have decreed, being thus well supported, it is confessedly and beyond all question acceptable and well-pleasing before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the images of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> as man, and those of the undefiled <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">ever-virgin Mary</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> Angels and of all Saints, should be venerated and saluted. And if anyone does not so <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but undertakes to debate the matter further and is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> affected with regard to the veneration due the sacred images, such an one our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ecumenical council (fortified by the inward working of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and by the traditions of the Fathers and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>) <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematises</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> is nothing less than complete separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if any are quarrelsome and will not obediently accept what has now been decreed, they but kick against the pricks, and injure their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in their fighting against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And in taking pleasure at the insults which are offered to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they clearly show themselves to be of those who madly make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and are therefore to be regarded as in the same category with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of old times, and their companions and brethren in ungodliness.</p>

<p>We have sent our brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, God-beloved Bishops, together with certain of the Hegumenoi and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, that they may give a full report of our proceedings to your godly-hearing ears. In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> and confirmation of what we have decreed, and also for the assurance of your most religious majesty, we have submitted <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from the Fathers, a few of the many we have gathered together in illustration of the brightly shining <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>And now may the Saviour of us all, who reigns with you (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x03B2;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x1F7B;&#x03C9;&#x03BD; &#x1F51;&#x03BC;&#x1FD6;&#x03BD;</span>) and who was pleased to vouchsafe his peace to the Churches through you, preserve your kingdom for many years, and also your council, princes, and faithful army, and the whole estate of the empire; and may he also give you victory over all your enemies. For he it is, who says: <q>As I live, says the Lord, they that glorify me, I will glorify.</q> He it is also who has girded you with strength, and will smite all your enemies, and make your people to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>.</p>

<p>And do, O city, the new Sion, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and be glad; you that are the wonder of the whole world. For although David has not reigned in you, nevertheless your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> princes here preside over your affairs as David would have done. The Lord is in the midst of you; may his name be blessed forever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
