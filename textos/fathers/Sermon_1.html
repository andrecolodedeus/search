<h1>Sermon 1</h1>

<p> <em>Preached on his Birthday , or day of Ordination.</em></p>

<h2>Having been elected in absence he returns thanks for the kindness and earnestly demands the prayers of his church</h2>

<p><q>Let my mouth speak the praise of the Lord ,</q> and my breath and spirit, my flesh and tongue bless His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Name. For it is a sign, not of a modest, but an ungrateful <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to keep silence on the kindnesses of God: and it is very meet to begin our duty as <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> pontiff with the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the Lord's praise.  Because <q>in our humility</q> the Lord <q>has been mindful of us </q> and has blessed us: because <q>He alone has done great wonders for me ,</q> so that your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> affection for me reckoned me present, though my long journey had forced me to be absent. Therefore I give and always shall give thanks to our God for all the things with which He has recompensed me. Your favourable opinion also I acknowledge publicly, paying you the thanks I owe, and thus showing that I understand how much respect, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and fidelity your affectionate <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> could expend on me who long with a shepherd's anxiety for the safety of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, who have passed so conscientious a judgment on me, with absolutely no deserts of mine to guide you. I entreat you, therefore, by the mercies of the Lord, aid with your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> him whom you have sought out by your solicitations that both the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may abide in me and that your judgment may not change. May He who inspired you with such unanimity of purpose, vouchsafe to us all in common the blessing of peace: so that all the days of my life being ready for the service of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and for my duties towards you, I may with confidence entreat the Lord: <q>Holy Father, keep in Your name those whom You have given me <span class="stiki" id="note360651"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;17:11</a></span>:</q> and while you ever go on unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, may <q>my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> magnify the Lord <span class="stiki" id="note360652"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;1:46</a></span>,</q> and in the retribution of the judgment to come may the account of my <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> so be rendered to the just Judge  that through your good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> you may be my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and my crown, who by your good will have given an earnest testimony to me in this present life.</p>
