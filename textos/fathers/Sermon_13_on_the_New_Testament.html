<h1>Sermon 13 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[LXIII. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse23">Matthew 8:23</a> <em>, <q>And when he was entered into a boat,</q> etc.</em></p>

<p>1. By the Lord's blessing, I will address you upon the lesson of the Holy <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which has just been read, and take occasion thereby to exhort you, that against the tempest and waves of this world, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> sleep not in your hearts. <q>For the Lord Christ had not indeed death nor sleep in His power, and perhaps sleep overcame the Almighty One as He was sailing against His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>?</q> If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this, He is asleep in you; but if Christ be awake in you, your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is awake. The Apostle says, <q>that Christ may dwell in your hearts by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q>  This sleep then of Christ is a sign of a high <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>.  The sailors are the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> passing over the world in wood. That ship also was a figure of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And all, individually indeed are temples of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and his own heart is the vessel in which each sails; nor can he suffer shipwreck, if his thoughts are only good.</p>

<p>2. You have heard an insult, it is the wind; you are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, it is a wave. When therefore the wind blows, and the wave swells, the ship is endangered, the heart is in jeopardy, the heart is tossed to and fro. When you have heard an insult, you long to be avenged; and, lo, avenged you have been, and so rejoicing in another's harm you have suffered shipwreck. And why is this? Because Christ is asleep in you. What does this mean, Christ is asleep in you? You have forgotten Christ. Rouse Him up then, call Christ to <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, let Christ awake in you, give heed to Him. What did you wish? To be avenged. Have you forgotten, that when He was being crucified, He said, <q>Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do?</q>  He who was asleep in your heart did not wish to be avenged. Awake Him up then, call Him to remembrance. The remembrance of Him is His word; the remembrance of Him is His command. And then will you say if Christ, awake in you, What manner of man am I, who wish to be avenged! Who am I, who deal out threatenings against another man? I may die perhaps before I am avenged. And when at my last breath, inflamed with rage, and thirsting for vengeance, I shall depart out of this body, He will not receive me, who did not wish to be avenged; He will not receive me, who said, <q>Give, and it shall be given unto you; forgive, and it shall be forgiven you.</q>  Therefore will I refrain myself from my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and return to the repose of my heart. Christ has commanded the sea, tranquillity is restored.</p>

<p>3. Now what I have said as to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, hold fast as a rule in all your <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. A <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> has sprung up; it is the wind; you are disturbed; it is a wave. Awake up Christ then, let Him speak with you. <q>Who is this, since the winds and the sea <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him?</q>  Who is this, whom the sea obeys? <q>The sea is His, and He made it.</q>  <q>All things were made by Him.</q>  Imitate the winds then, and the sea rather; <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the Creator. At Christ's command the sea gives ear; and are you deaf? The sea hears, and the wind ceases: and do you still blow on? What! I say, I do, I devise; what is all this, but to be blowing on, and to be unwilling to stop in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the word of Christ? Let not the wave master you in this troubled state of your heart. Yet since we are but men, if the wind should drive us on, and stir up the affections of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, let us not despair; let us awake Christ, that we may sail on a tranquil sea, and so come to our country. <q>Let us  turn to the Lord,</q> etc.</p>
