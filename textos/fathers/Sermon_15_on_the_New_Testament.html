<h1>Sermon 15 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[LXV. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew 10:28</a> <em>, <q>Be not afraid of them that kill the body.</q> Delivered on a Festival of Martyrs.</em></p>

<p>1. The Divine oracles which have just been read teach us in fearing not to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and in not fearing to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. You observed when the Holy <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was being read, that our Lord God before He died for us, would have us to be firm; and this by admonishing us <q>not</q> to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and withal to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For he said, <q>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> See where He advised us not to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. See now where He advised us to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. <q>But,</q> says he, <q><a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him who has power to destroy both body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</q>  Let us <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> therefore, that we may not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Fear seems to be allied to cowardice: seems to be the character of the weak, not the strong. But see what says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord is the hope of strength.</q>  Let us then <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, that we may not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; that is, let us <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> prudently, that we may not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> vainly. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Martyrs on the occasion of whose <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> this lesson was read out of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, in fearing, feared not; because in fearing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they did not regard men.</p>

<p>2. For what need a man <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> from man? And what is that whereby one man should <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> another <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, since both of them are men? One threatens and says, <q>I will kill you;</q> and does not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, lest after his threat he die before he have fulfilled it. <q>I will kill you,</q> he says. Who says it, and to whom? I hear two men, the one threatening, and the other alarmed: of whom the one is powerful, and the other weak, yet both are mortal. Why then does he so stretch out himself, he, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, a somewhat more inflated power, in body, equal weakness? Let him securely threaten death who does not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> death. But if he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that whereby he causes <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; let him think of himself, and compare himself with him whom he is threatening. Let him see in him whom he threatens a likeness of condition, and so together with him let him seek like pity from the Lord. For he is but a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and he threatens another man, a creature, another creature; only the one puffed up under his Creator's eye, and the other fleeing for refuge to the same Creator.</p>

<p>3. Let the stout Martyr then, as he stands a man before another man, say; <q>I do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, because I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q> You can not do what you are threatening, unless He will; but what He threatens, none can hinder Him from doing. And then again, what do you threaten, and what can you do, if you are permitted? Your <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> extends but to the flesh, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is safe from you. You can not kill what you do not see: visible yourself, you threaten that which is visible in me. But we have both an invisible Creator, whom we ought both to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; who of that which was both visible and invisible created man. He made Him visible out of the earth, and with His Breath He breathed into Him an invisible Spirit. Therefore the invisible substance, that is, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which has raised from the earth the earth as it lay, does not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, when you assault the earth. You can strike the habitation, but can you strike him who dwells there? When the chain is broken, he escapes who before was bound, and he will now be crowned in secret. Why then do you threaten me, who canst do nothing to my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Through the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of that to which you can do nothing, will that to which your power extends rise again. For through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> desert, will the flesh also rise again; and will be restored to its inhabitant, now no more to fail, but to endure for ever. Behold (I am using the words of a Martyr), behold, I say, not even on account of my body do I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> your threats. My body indeed is subject to your power; but even the hairs of my head are numbered by my Creator. Why should I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest I lose my body, who cannot even lose a hair? How shall he not have a care of my body, to whom my meanest things are so well known? This body which may be wounded and slain will for a time be ashes, but it will be for ever <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. But to whom shall this be? To whom shall the body be restored for life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, even though it have been slain, destroyed, and scattered to the winds? To whom shall it be so restored? To him who has not been afraid to lay down his own life, since he does not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, lest his body should be slain.</p>

<p>4. For, Brethren, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is said to be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> it is according to a certain manner of its own: for it is a kind of life which is able to give life to the body by its presence. For by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does the body live. This life cannot die, and therefore is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. Why then said I according to a certain manner of its own? Hear why. Because there is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> which is an entire unchangeableness; of which the Apostle says, speaking of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>Who only has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, dwelling in that light which no man may approach unto, whom no man has seen, nor can see, to whom be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q>  If then God only has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must needs be mortal. See then why it was that I said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> after a certain manner of its own. For in fact it may also die. Understand this, Beloved, and there will remain no difficulty. I venture to say then that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can die, can be slain also. Yet it is undoubtedly <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. See, I venture to say, it is at once <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and it may be slain; and therefore I said that there is a kind of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, an entire unchangeableness, that is, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Only has, of whom it is said, <q>Who Only has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>;</q> for if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be slain, how did the Lord Himself say, when He would make us <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, <q>Fear Him who has power to slay both body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a></q>?</p>

<p>5. Hitherto I have confirmed, not solved, the difficulty. I have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can be slain. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> cannot be gainsaid but by the ungodly <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Lo, something occurs to me here, and comes into my mind to speak. Life cannot be gainsaid, but by a dead <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is life, impiety and infidelity are the death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. See then, it can die, and yet it is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. How then is it <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>? Because there is always a sort of life which is never extinguished in it. And how does it die? Not in ceasing to be life, but by losing its life. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is both life to something else, and it has its own proper life. Consider the order of the creatures. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the life of the body: God is the life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. As the life, that is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is present with the body, that the body die not; so ought the life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be with it that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> die not. How does the body die? By the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> leaving it. I say, by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> leaving it the body dies; and it lies along a mere carcass, what was a little before a desirable, now a contemptible, object. There are in it still its several members, the eyes, and ears; but these are but the windows of the house, its inhabitant is gone. They who bewail the dead, cry in vain at the windows of the house; there is none within to hear. How many things does the fond affection of the mourner give utterance to, how many enumerate and call to mind; and with what a <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of sorrow, so to say, does he speak, as with one who was sensible of what was doing, when he is really speaking with one who is no longer there? He recounts his good qualities, and the tokens of his goodness towards himself. It was you that gave me this; and did this and that for me; it was you who did thus, and thus dearly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me. But if you would only consider and understand, and restrain the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of your grief, he who once loved you, is gone; in vain does the house receive your knockings, in which you can not find a dweller.</p>

<p>6. Let us return to the subject I was speaking of a little while since. The body is dead. Why? Because its life, that is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is gone. Again, the body is alive, and the man is impious, unbelieving, hard of belief, incorrigible; in this case while the body is alive, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by which the body lives is dead. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is so excellent a thing, that it has power even though dead to give life to the body. So excellent a thing, I say, is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so excellent a creature, that even though dead itself, it has power to quicken the body. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the impious, unbelieving, unregulated man is dead, and yet by it though dead the body lives. And therefore is it in the body; it sets on the hands to work, and the feet to walk; it directs the eye to see, it disposes the ears to hear, it discriminates tastes, avoids pains, seeks after pleasures. All these are tokens of the life of the body; but they are from the presence of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. If I were to ask a body whether it were alive; it would answer me, You see me walking, you see me working, you hear me talking, you perceive that I have certain aims and aversions, and do you not understand that the body is alive? By these works then of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is placed within, I understand that the body is alive. I ask the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also whether it is alive? It also has its proper works, by which it manifests its life. The feet walk. I understand by this that the body lives, but by the presence of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. I ask now, does the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> live? These feet walk. (To speak only of this one movement.) I am questioning both body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as touching their life. The feet walk, I understand that the body lives. But whither do they walk? To <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, it is said. Then is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> dead. For so has unerring Scripture said, <q>The <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who lives in pleasure is dead.</q>  Now since the difference is great between <q>pleasure</q> and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, how can the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is said to be dead in pleasure, live in <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>? It is surely dead. But it is dead even though it be not in this case. I hear a man speaking; the body then lives. For the tongue could not move itself in the mouth, and by its several motions give utterance to articulate sounds, were there not an inhabitant within; and a musician as it were to this instrument, to make use of his tongue. I understand it perfectly. Thus the body speaks; the body then lives. But I ask, is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alive also? Lo, the body speaks, and so is alive. But what does it speak? As I said concerning the feet; they walk, and so the body is alive, and I then asked, whither do they walk? That I might understand whether the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was alive also. So also when I hear a man speak, I understand that the body is alive; I ask what does he speak, that I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is alive also. He speaks a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>. If so, then is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> dead. How do we prove this? Let us ask the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, which says, <q>The mouth that lies, slays the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q>  I ask, why is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> dead? I ask as I did just now, why is the body dead? Because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, its life, had gone. Why is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> dead? Because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, its life, has forsaken it.</p>

<p>7. After this brief examination then, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and hold for certain that the body is dead without the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is dead without God. Every man without God has a dead <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. You bewail the dead: bewail the sinner rather, bewail rather the ungodly man, bewail the unbeliever. It is written, <q>The mourning for the dead is seven days; for a fool and an ungodly man all the days of his life.</q>  What! Are there no bowels of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> compassion in you; that you mourn for a body from which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is gone, and mournest not for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, from which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is departed? Let the Martyr remembering this make answer to him that threatens him, <q>Why do you force me to deny Christ?</q> Would you then force me to deny the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? And if I will not, what will you do? You will assault my body, that my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall depart from it; but this same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of mine has its body only for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> sake. It is not so foolish or unwise. You would wound my body; but would you, that through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest you should wound my body, and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should depart from it, I should wound my own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and my God should depart from it? Fear not then, O Martyr, the sword of your executioner; <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> only your own tongue, lest you do execution upon your own self, and slay, not your body, but your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Fear for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, lest it die in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell-fire</a>.</p>

<p>8. Therefore said the Lord, <q>Who has power to slay both body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell-fire</a>.</q> How? When the ungodly shall be cast into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell-fire</a>, will his body and his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> burn there? Everlasting punishment will be the death of the body; the absence of God will be the death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Would you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what the death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is? Understand the Prophet who says, <q>Let the ungodly be taken away, that he may not see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord.</q>  Let the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> then <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> its proper death, and not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the death of its body. Because if it <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> its own death, and so live in its <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by not offending and thrusting Him away from him, it will be found worthy  to receive its body again at the end; not unto everlasting punishment, as the ungodly, but unto life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, as the righteous. By fearing this death, and loving that life, did the Martyrs, in <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promises</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in contempt of the threats of persecutors, attain  themselves to be crowned with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have left to us the celebration of these solemnities.</p>
