<h1>Sermon 18 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[LXVIII. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>Again on the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse25">Matthew 11:25</a> <em>, <q>I thank you, O Father, Lord of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and Earth,</q> etc.</em></p>

<p>1. We have heard the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> saying, <q>I confess to You, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth.</q> What does he confess to Him? Wherein does he praise Him? <q>Because You have hid these things from the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, and hast revealed them unto babes.</q>  Who are the <q>wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a></q>? Who the <q>babes</q>? What has He hid from the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, and revealed unto babes? By the <q>wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>,</q> He signifies those of whom St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> speaks; <q>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made foolish the wisdom of this world?</q>  Yet perhaps you still ask who they are. They are they perhaps who in their much disputation concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have spoken <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> of Him; who, puffed up by their own doctrines, could in no wise find out and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who for the God whose substance is incomprehensible and invisible, have thought the air and sky to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or the sun to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or anything which holds high place  among the creatures to be God. For observing the grandeur and beauty and powers of the creatures, they rested in them, and found not the Creator.</p>

<p>2. These men does the Book of wisdom reprove, where it is said, <q>For if they were able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> so much as to aim at the world, how did they not sooner find out the Lord thereof?</q>  They are accused as wasting their time and their busy disputes in investigating and measuring as it were the creature; they sought out the courses of the stars, the intervals of the planets, the movements  of the heavenly bodies, so as to arrive by certain  calculations to that degree of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as to foretell the eclipses of the sun and moon; and that as they had foretold, so should the event be according to the day and hour, and to the portion of the bodies which should be eclipsed. Great industry, great activity of mind. But in these things they sought after the Creator, who was not far off from them, and they found Him not. Whom if they could have found, they might have had within them. With the best reason then, and very rightly were they accused, who could investigate the numbers of the stars, and their varied movements, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and foretell the eclipses of the luminaries: rightly accused, I say, in that they found not Him by whom these had been created and ordained, because they neglected to seek Him. But be not much disquieted, if you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the courses of the stars, and the proportions  of the celestial and terrestrial bodies. Behold the fair beauty of the world, and praise its Creator's counsel. Behold what He has made, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him who made it: be this your greatest care. Love Him who made it; for He made you also after His own image, that you might <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him.</p>

<p>3. If then it is strange that those things of which Christ said, <q>You have hid these things from the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>,</q> were hidden from such wise men as these, who, occupied wholly about the creatures, chose to seek the Creator carelessly, and could not find Him; still more strange is it that there should even be found some <q>wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a></q> men who were able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. <q>For the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men who hold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in unrighteousness.</q>  Perhaps you ask, what <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> do they hold in unrighteousness? <q>Because that which may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of God is manifest among them.</q> How is it manifest? He goes on to say, <q>For God has manifested it to them.</q>  Do you still enquire how He manifested it to them to whom He gave not the law? How? <q>For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.</q>  There were then some such, not as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not as many Prophets who had an insight into and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these things, and were aided by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, which they drew in by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and drank with the throat  of godliness, and poured  forth again by the mouth of the interior man. Not such as these were they; but far unlike them, who by means of this visible creation were able to attain to the understanding of the Creator, and to say of these things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has made;  Behold what things He has made, He governs and contains also. He who has made them, Himself fills what He has made with His own presence. Thus much they were enabled to say. For these <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also made mention of in the Acts of the Apostles, where, when he had said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>For in Him we live and move and have our being</q>  (forasmuch as he was speaking to the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> among whom those learned men had <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>); he subjoined immediately; <q>As certain also of your own have said.</q> Now it was no trivial thing they said; <q>That in Him we live and move and have our being.</q></p>

<p>4. In what then were they unlike the others? Why were they blamed? Why rightly accused? Hear the words of the Apostle which I had begun to quote; <q>The <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> says he, <q>is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness</q> (even of those, namely, who had not received the law); <q>against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who hold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in unrighteousness.</q> What <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? <q>Because that which may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of God is manifest in them.</q> By whose manifestation of it? <q>For God has manifested it to them.</q> How? <q>For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His Eternal Power and Godhead.</q> Why did He manifest it? <q>That they might be without excuse.</q> Wherein then are they to be blamed? <q>Because that when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>5. What mean these words, <q>Glorified Him not as God?</q> They did not give Him thanks. Is this then to glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; to give God thanks? Yes, verily. For what can be worse, if having been created after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and having come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you shall not be thankful to Him? This surely, this is to glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to give God thanks. The faithful <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> where and when it is said, <q>Let us give thanks unto our Lord God.</q> But who gives thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, save he who <q>lifts up his heart unto the Lord?</q> Therefore are they blameable and without excuse, <q>Because when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor gave Him thanks. But</q>&mdash; what? <q>But they became vain in their imaginations.</q> Whence did they become vain, but because they were <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>? Thus smoke vanishes away by rising up aloft, and a flame burns the more brightly and strongly in proportion as it is kept  low; <q>They became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</q> So smoke, though it rise higher than the flame, is dark.</p>

<p>6. Finally, mark what follows, and see the point on which the whole matter depends. <q>For professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.</q> For arrogating to themselves what God had given, God took away what He had given. Therefore from the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> He hid Himself, who conveyed the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself only to those who through the creature sought diligently after the Creator. Well then did our Lord say, <q>You have hid these things from the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>;</q> whether from those who in their manifold disputations, and most busy search, have reached to the full investigation of the creature, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing of the Creator, or from them who when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor gave Him thanks, and who could not see perfectly or healthfully because they were <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>. <q>Therefore You have hid these things from the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, and hast revealed them unto babes.</q> What babes? To the lowly. Say on whom does My Spirit rest? <q>Upon him that is lowly and quiet, and who trembles at My words.</q>  At these words Peter trembled; <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> trembled not. Let the fisherman hold fast what that most famous <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> has lost. <q>You have hid these things from the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, and hast revealed them unto babes.</q> You have hid them from the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and revealed them to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>. What things are these? For when He said this, He did not intend the heaven and earth, or point them out as it were with His hand as He spoke. For these who does not see? The good see them, the bad see them; for He <q>makes His sun to rise on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and the good.</q>  What then are these things? <q>All things are delivered unto Me of My Father.</q> </p>
