<h1>Sermon 2</h1>

<p> <em>On his Birthday, II.: Delivered on the Anniversary  of his Consecration.</em></p>

<h2>I. The Lord raises up the weak and gives him grace according to his need</h2>

<p>The Divine condescension has made this an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> day for me, for it has shown by raising  my humbleness to the highest rank, that He despised not any of His own. And hence, although one must be diffident of merit, yet it is one's bounden duty to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over the gift, since He who is the Imposer of the burden  is Himself  the Aider in its execution: and lest the weak recipient should fall beneath the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, He who conferred the dignity will also give the power. As the day therefore returns in due course on which the Lord purposed that I should begin my episcopal office, there is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for me to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who that I might <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him much, has forgiven me much, and that I might make His Grace wonderful, has conferred His gifts upon me in whom He found no recommendations of merit. And by this His work what does the Lord suggest and commend to our hearts but that no one should presume upon his own righteousness nor distrust God's mercy which shines out more pre-eminently then, when the sinner is made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and the downcast lifted up. For the measure of heavenly gifts does not rest upon the quality of our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, nor in this world, in which <q>all life is <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> ,</q> is each one rewarded according to his deserving, for if the Lord were to take count of a man's iniquities, no one could stand before His judgment.</p>

<h2>II. The mighty assemblage of prelates testifies to men's loyal acceptance of Peter in Peter's unworthy successor</h2>

<p>Therefore, dearly-beloved, <q>magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt His name together ,</q> that the whole reason of today's concourse may be referred to the praise of Him Who brought it to pass. For so far as my own feelings are concerned, I confess that I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> most over the devotion of you all; and when I look upon this splendid assemblage of my venerable brother-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>  I feel that, where so many <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are gathered, the very <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are among us. Nor do I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that we are today visited by a more abundant outpouring of the Divine Presence, when so many fair tabernacles of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so many excellent members of the Body of Christ are in one place and shine with one light. Nor yet I feel sure, is the fostering condescension and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the most blessed Apostle Peter absent from this congregation: he has not deserted your devotion, in whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> you are met together. And so he too rejoices over your good feeling and welcomes your respect for the Lord's own institution as shown towards the partners of His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, commending the well ordered <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which ever finds Peter in Peter's See, and from affection for so great a shepherd grows not lukewarm even over so inferior a successor as myself. In order therefore, dearly beloved, that this loyalty which you unanimously display towards my humbleness may obtain the fruit of its <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, on bended knee entreat the merciful goodness of our God that in our days He will drive out those who assail us, strengthen <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, increase <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, increase peace and deign to render me His poor slave, whom to show the riches of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> He has willed to stand at the helm of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, sufficient for so great a work and useful in building you up, and to this end to lengthen our time for service that the years He may grant us may be used to His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> through Christ our Lord. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
