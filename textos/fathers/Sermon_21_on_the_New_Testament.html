<h1>Sermon 21 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[LXXI. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse32">Matthew 12:32</a> <em>, <q>Whosoever shall speak a word against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.</q> Or, <q>on the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q></em></p>

<p>1. There has been a great question raised touching the late lesson of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, to the solution of which I am unequal by any power of my own; but <q>our sufficiency is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  to whatever degree we are capable of receiving His aid. First then consider the magnitude of the question; that when you see the weight of it laid upon my shoulders, you may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in aid of my labours, and in the assistance which is vouchsafed to me, may find edification for your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. When <q>one possessed with a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was brought to the Lord, blind and dumb, and He had healed him so that he could speak and see, and all the people were amazed and said, Is not this the Son of David? The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> hearing it said, This fellow does not cast out devils but by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> the prince of the devils. But Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself shall be brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand. And if <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> cast out <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?</q>  In these words He wished it to be understood from their own confession, that, through their not believing in Him they had chosen to belong to the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, which as being divided against itself could accordingly not stand. Let then the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> make choice of which they will. If <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> cannot cast out <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, they can find nothing to say against the Lord; but if he can, then let them much more look to themselves, and depart out of his kingdom, which as being divided against itself cannot stand.</p>

<p>2. But now that they may not think that it is the prince of the devils in whom the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> casts out devils, let them attend to what follows; <q>And if I,</q> He says, <q>by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore shall they be your judges.</q>  He spoke this undoubtedly of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, the <q>children</q> of that people; who as being the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> were well conscious that they had learned no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> arts from their Good Master, that through the prince of the devils they should cast out devils. <q>Therefore,</q> He says, <q>shall they be your judges.</q> They, He says, the base and contemptible things of this world, in whom none of this artificial <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> simplicity of My power  is seen; they shall be My witnesses, they shall be your judges. Then He subjoins, <q>But if I by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> cast out devils, then the kingdom of God has come unto you.</q>  What is this? <q>If I by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> cast out devils,</q> He says, and your children, to whom I have given no hurtful and deceitful doctrine but a simple <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, can in no other way cast them out; no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the kingdom of God has come unto you; whereby the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is subverted, and you also are subverted with it.</p>

<p>3. And after that He had said, <q>By whom do your children cast them out?</q> to show that in them it was His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not their own desert; He says, <q>Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house and spoil his goods, except He first bind the strong man, and then He will spoil his house?</q>  Your children, says He, who either have already <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Me, or who shall yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and cast out devils, not through the prince of the devils, but through the simplicity of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, who assuredly either once were, or still are what you are also, sinners and ungodly; and so in the house of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and the vessels of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, how could they be rescued from him whom he held so firmly through the iniquity which reigned over them, unless he were bound by the chains of My <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that I might take away from him his vessels which once were vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and make them vessels of mercy? This it is which the blessed Apostle also says when he rebukes the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and those who boast as it were of their own deserts, <q>For who makes you to differ?</q>  That is, who makes you to differ from the mass of perdition derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and from the vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>. And that no man might say, <q>My own righteousness,</q> he says, <q>What have you, that you did not receive?</q> And on this point he says of himself also, <q>We also once were by nature the children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, even as others.</q>  So then he himself was a vessel in the house of that strong one, strong in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, when he was a persecutor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, a <q>blasphemer, injurious, living in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>,</q> as he confesses. But He who bound the strong one, took away from him this vessel of perdition, and made it a vessel of election.</p>

<p>4. Afterwards, that the unbelievers and ungodly, the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name, might not suppose by reason of the various <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and schisms of those who under the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name gather together flocks of lost sheep, that the kingdom of Christ also is divided against itself, He next adds, <q>He that is not with Me is against Me, and he that gathers not with Me, scatters abroad.</q>  He does not say, he who is under the outward profession  of My Name; or the form of My Sacrament; but <q>he who is not with Me is against Me.</q> Nor does He say, he who gathers not under the outward profession of My Name; but <q>he who gathers not with Me, scatters abroad.</q> Christ's kingdom then is not divided against itself; but men try to divide that which was bought with the price of the Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <q>For the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them that are His. And, let every one that names the Name of Christ depart from iniquity.</q>  For if he depart not from iniquity, he belongs not to the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even though he name the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. To give then some illustrations for example's sake, the spirit of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and the spirit of luxuriousness, because the one heaps together, and the other lavishes, are divided against themselves; yet they belong both to the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Among idolaters the spirit of Juno and the spirit of Hercules, are divided against themselves; and both belong to the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> Christ's enemy, and the Jew Christ's enemy, are divided against themselves; and both belong to the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianus</a> and Photinianus both are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and both are divided against themselves. The <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> and Maximianist  both are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and both divided against themselves. All men's <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> that are contrary to each other are divided against themselves, and all belong to the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; therefore his kingdom shall not stand. But the righteous and the ungodly, the believer and the unbeliever, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, are indeed divided against themselves, but they do not belong all to the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <q>The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them that are His.</q> Let no one flatter himself upon a mere name. If he would that the Name of the Lord should profit him, let <q>him that calls upon the Name of the Lord depart from iniquity.</q></p>

<p>5. But these words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, though they had some obscurity, which I think by the Lord's assistance I have explained, were yet not so difficult, as that which follows would seem to be. <q>Wherefore I say unto you, all manner of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> shall be forgiven unto men, but the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the Spirit shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaks a word against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaks against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</q>  What then will become of those whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> desires to gain? When they have been reformed and come into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from whatsoever <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, is the hope in the remission of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that is promised them a false hope? For who is not convicted of having spoken a word against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, before he became a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> or a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>? In the first place, are not they who are called Pagans, the worshippers of many and false gods, and the adorers of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, forasmuch as they say that the Lord Christ wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by magical arts, are not they like these who said that He cast out devils through the prince of the devils? And again, when day by day they <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> our sanctification, what else <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> they but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? What? Do not the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>&mdash; they who spoke concerning our Lord what gave occasion to this very discourse&mdash; do they not even to the present day speak a word against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by denying that He is now in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, just as the others denied Him to be in Christ? For not even did they revile the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by asserting either that He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> not, or that though He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, yet that He was not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but a creature; or that He had no power to cast out devils; they did not speak thus unworthily, or anything like it, of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> indeed denied the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> maintained His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> against their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>,  but they denied that He was in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who they thought cast out devils through the prince of the devils, whereas He did cast them out through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And hence, both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and whatsoever <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> there are who confess the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but deny that He is in the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is His One Only Church, none other than the One <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> like the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> who at that time although they confessed the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, yet denied that He was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whose works in casting out devils they attributed to the prince of devils. I say nothing of the fact that some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> either boldly maintain that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not the Creator but a creature, as the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, and Eunomians, and Macedonians, or so entirely deny His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, as to deny that God is Trinity, but assert that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father only, and that He is sometimes called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and sometimes the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; as the Sabellians, whom some call Patripassians, because they hold that the Father suffered; and forasmuch as they deny that He has any Son, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> they deny His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also. The <a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinians</a> again who say that the Father only is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Son a mere man, deny altogether that there is any third Person of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</p>

<p>6. It is plain then that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> both by Pagans, and by <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Are they then to be left, and accounted without all hope, since the sentence is fixed, <q>Whosoever speaks a word against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come</q>? And are they only to be deemed free from the guilt of this most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> who are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from infancy? For all those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that they might become <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, came surely into the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and peace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, either from among the Pagans, or <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>: and if there be no pardon for them for the word which they have spoken against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in vain do we promise and preach to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and receive peace and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, whether in Baptism or in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For it is not said, <q>It shall not be forgiven him except in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>;</q> but, <q>it shall not be forgiven, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</q></p>

<p>7. Some think that they only <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who having been washed in the laver of regeneration in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and having received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as though unthankful for so great a gift of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, have plunged themselves afterwards into any deadly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; as <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, or an absolute <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>,  either altogether from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name, or from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But how this sense of it may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not; since the place of repentance is not denied in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> whatever; and the Apostle says that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> themselves are to be reproved to this end, <q>If God perhaps will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who are taken captive by him at his will.</q>  For what is the advantage of amendment without any hope of forgiveness? Finally, The Lord did not say, <q>the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>  <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> who shall speak a word against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>;</q> but <q>he who,</q> that is whosoever speaks, be he who he may, <q>it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</q> Whether then he be a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, or a Jew, or a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> from among <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, or whatsoever other title of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> he have, it is not said, this man, or that man; but <q>whosoever speaks a word against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> that is who blasphemes the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, <q>it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</q> But moreover if every <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> contrary to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and inimical to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peace, as we have shown before, <q>speaks a word against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>;</q> and yet the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not cease to reform and gather out of every <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> those who shall receive remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Himself, whom they have <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>; I think I have discovered an important secret for the clearing up this so great a question. Let us seek then from the Lord the light of explanation.</p>

<p>8. Lift up then, Brethren, lift up unto me your ears, and your hearts unto the Lord. I tell you, my Beloved; perhaps there is not in all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture found a more important or more difficult question. Wherefore (that I may make you a confession about myself), I have always in my discourses to the people avoided the difficulty and embarrassment of this question; not because I had no ideas of any sort on the subject, for in a matter of such great importance, I would not be negligent in <q>asking,</q> and <q>seeking,</q> and <q>knocking;</q> but because I did not think I could do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>  to that understanding of it which was in some degree opened to me, by words suggested at the moment. But as I listened to today's lesson, upon which it was my duty to discourse to you, as the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was being read, there was such a beating at my heart, that I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that it was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that you should hear something on the subject by my ministry.</p>

<p>9. First then, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you to consider and understand that the Lord did not say, <q>No <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the Spirit shall be forgiven,</q> or, <q>whosoever speaks any word whatsoever against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him;</q> but <q>whosoever speaks a word;</q>  for had he said the former, there would have remained to us no subject of disputation at all. Since if no <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and no word which is spoken against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, shall be forgiven unto men; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> could not gain any one out of all the classes of ungodly sinners who gainsay the gift of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of whatsoever sort, and some even of little  <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself. But God forbid that the Lord should say this: God forbid, I say, that the Truth should say that every <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and every word which should be spoken against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, has no forgiveness neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</p>

<p>10. His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> indeed was to exercise us by the difficulty of the question, not to deceive us by a false decision. Wherefore there is no necessity for any one to think, that every <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> or every word which is spoken against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has no remission; but necessary it plainly is, that there should be some certain <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and some word which if it be spoken against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> can never attain  to pardon and forgiveness. For if we take it to mean <q>every word,</q> who then can be saved? But if again we think there is no such <q>word,</q> we contradict the Saviour. There is then without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> some certain <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and some word which if it be spoken against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, shall not be forgiven. Now what this word is, it is the Lord's will we should enquire; and therefore He has not expressed it. His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, I say, was that it should be enquired into, not denied. For the style of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> is often such, that when anything is so expressed as not to be limited either to a universal or particular signification, it is not necessary that it should be understood universally, and not particularly. This proposition then would be expressed in its whole extent, that is, universally, if it were said, <q>All <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>  of the Spirit shall not be forgiven;</q> or, <q>Whosoever speaks any word whatsoever against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</q> But it would be expressed partially, that is, particularly, if it were said, <q>Some certain <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the Spirit shall not be forgiven.</q> But because this proposition is laid down neither in a universal, nor a particular form (for it is not said, <q>Every <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>;</q> or some certain <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; but only indefinitely, <q><a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the Spirit shall not be forgiven;</q> neither is it said, <q>Whosoever speaks any word whatever,</q> or <q>whosoever speaks some certain word,</q> but indefinitely, <q>whosoever speaks a word</q>), there is no necessity that we should understand <q>every <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and every word;</q> but necessary it plainly is that the Lord designed some kind of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and some word to be understood; though He would not express it, that, if we should receive any right understanding of it by asking, and seeking, and knocking, we might not entertain a low esteem of it.</p>

<p>11. In order to seeing this more plainly, consider that which the same Lord also says of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q>  For this again was not said with any such meaning, as if He intended it to be understood that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> would have been without any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all, if He had not come and spoken to them. For indeed He found them full of and laden with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Wherefore He says, <q>Come unto Me, all you that labour and are heavy laden.</q>  Laden! With what, but with the burdens of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and transgressions of the Law? <q>For the Law entered that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might abound.</q>  Since then He says Himself in another place, <q>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance;</q>  how would <q>they not have had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> if He had not come</q>? If it be not that this proposition being expressed neither universally, nor particularly, but indefinitely, does not constrain us to understand it of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? But certainly unless we understand that there was some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which they would not have had if Christ had not come and spoken unto them, we must say that the proposition was false, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid. He does not say then, <q>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had had no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q> lest the Truth should lie. Nor again did He say definitely, <q>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had some certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q> lest our devout earnestness  should not be exercised. For in the full abundance of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> we feed upon the plain parts, we are exercised by the obscure: by the one, hunger is driven away, and daintiness  by the other. Seeing then that it is not said, <q>they had had no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> we need not be disturbed, though we acknowledge that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> would have been sinners, even if the Lord had not come. But yet because it is said, <q>If I had not come, they had not had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q> it must needs be that they contracted, though not all, yet some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which they had not before, from the coming of the Lord. And this verily is that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not in Him who was present with and spoke to them, and that counting Him as an enemy because He spoke the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they put Him besides to death. This <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> so great and terrible it is clear they had not had if He had not come and spoken to them. As then when we hear the words, <q>They had not had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q> we do not understand all, but some, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; so when we hear in today's lesson, <q>Blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven;</q> we understand not all, but a certain kind of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; and when we hear, <q>Whosoever speaks a word against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him;</q> we ought not to understand every, but some certain word.</p>

<p>12. For in that He says also in this very text, <q>But <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the Spirit shall not be forgiven;</q> surely we must needs understand not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of every spirit, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. And though He had not expressed this anywhere else more plainly, who could be so silly as to understand it in any other way? According to the same rule of speech is this expression also understood, <q>Unless a man be born of water and of the Spirit.</q>  For He does not say in that place, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; yet this is understood. Nor because He said of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, is any one forced to understand it of every spirit. Wherefore when you hear, <q>But the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the Spirit shall not be forgiven;</q> as you must not understand it of every spirit, so not of every <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the Spirit.</p>

<p>13. I see that you are now wishing to hear, since it is not every <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, what that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is which shall not be forgiven, and what that word is, since it is not every word which if it shall be spoken against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, shall not be forgiven neither in this world, neither in the world to come. And for my part I should be willing to tell you at once, what you are so very intently waiting to hear; but bear for a while the delay which a more careful diligence requires, till by the Lord's assistance I shall unfold the whole meaning of the passage before us. Now the other two Evangelists, Mark and Luke, when they spoke of the same thing, did not say <q><a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a></q> or <q>a word,</q> that we might understand it not of every <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, but of some sort of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; not every word, but some certain word. What then did they say? In Mark it is thus written, <q>Verily I say unto you, all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shall be forgiven unto the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, where-withsoever they shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>. But he that shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, has never forgiveness, but shall be held guilty of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> offense.</q>  In Luke it is thus: <q>And whosoever shall speak a word against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, it shall be forgiven him; but unto him that blasphemes against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven.</q>  Is there any departure from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the same proposition because of some diversity in the expression? For indeed there is no other reason why the Evangelists do not relate the same things in the same way, but that we may learn thereby to prefer things to words, not words to things, and to seek for nothing else in the speaker, but for his intention, to convey which only the words are used. For what real difference is there whether it is said, <q>Blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven;</q> or <q>he that blasphemes against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him.</q> Except perhaps that the same thing is declared more plainly in this last than in the other form; and so one Evangelist does not overthrow, but explains the other. Now <q><a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the Spirit</q> is an unevident  expression; because it is not directly said what spirit; for every spirit is not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Thus it might be called <q><a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the spirit,</q> when a man blasphemes with the spirit; as that may be called <q><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the spirit,</q> when one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> with the spirit. Whence the Apostle says, <q>I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with the spirit, and I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with the understanding also.</q>  But when it is said, <q>he that shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> these ambiguities are removed. So the expression, <q>has never forgiveness, but shall be held guilty of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> offense;</q> what is it, but what according to Matthew is expressed, <q>it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come</q>? The very same idea is expressed in different words and different forms of speech. And what is in Matthew, <q>Whosoever speaks a word against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> that we might not understand it of anything but <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, others have more clearly expressed, <q>He that shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> Yet the same thing is said by all; nor did any one of them depart from the intention of the Speaker, for the sake of understanding which only are words spoken, and written, and read, and heard.</p>

<p>14. But one may say, See I have admitted and understood that where the word <q><a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a></q> is used, and neither all, nor some certain <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> expressed, it may be understood either of all, or of some certain <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, but not necessarily of all; but again if it be not understood of some, that that which is said would be untrue: so again if it is not said every or some certain word, it is not necessary that every word should be understood, but unless some word be understood, in no way can what is said be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But when we read, <q>He that shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>,</q> how can I understand any certain <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, when the word <q><a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a></q> is not used, or any certain word, when the word <q>word</q> is not used, but it seems to be said as it were generally, <q>He that shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>.</q> To this objection  I reply thus. If it were said in this passage also, <q>He that shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> with any kind of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> whatever against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> there would be no reason why we should think that some particular <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> was to be sought for, when we ought rather to understand all <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; but because all <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> could not be meant, lest the hope of forgiveness in case of their amendment should be taken away from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and all kinds of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who by their various <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and contradictions <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; it remains without a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that in the passage where it is written, <q>He that shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has never forgiveness,</q> he must be meant, not who has in any way whatever <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>; but he who has <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> in such a particular way, that he can never be pardoned.</p>

<p>15. For as in that it is said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> tempts no man,</q>  it is not to be understood that God tempts no man with any kind, but only not with some certain kind of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>; lest that be false, which is written, <q>The Lord your God tempts you;</q>  and lest we deny that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or say that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is false, when we read that He asked His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> <q>tempting him; but He Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what He would do.</q>  For there is a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> which induces to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, with which <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> tempts no man,</q> and there is a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> which only proves our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, with which even God vouchsafes to tempt. So when we hear, <q>He that shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> we must not take it of every kind of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, as neither in the other place, of every kind of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</p>

<p>16. So again when we hear, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> shall be saved;</q>  we do not of course understand it of one who believes in such a way <q>as the devils <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and tremble;</q>  nor of those who receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in such sort as <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>,  who though he could be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, could not be saved. As then when He said, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> shall be saved,</q> He had not in his view all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but some only; those, to wit, who are settled in that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which, according to the Apostle's distinction, <q>works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>:</q>  so when he said, <q>He that shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has never forgiveness,</q> he did not intend every kind, but a specific <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by which whosoever shall be bound, he shall never by any remission be loosed.</p>

<p>17. That expression also of His, <q>He that eats My Flesh and drinks My Blood dwells in Me, and I in him,</q>  how must we understand? Can we include in these words those even of whom the Apostle says, <q>that they eat and drink judgment to themselves;</q>  when they eat this flesh and drink this blood? What! Did Judas the impious seller and betrayer of his Master  (though, as Luke the Evangelist declares more plainly, he ate and drank with the rest of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> this first Sacrament of His body and blood, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>  by the Lord's hands), did he <q>dwell in Christ and Christ in him</q>? Do so many, in fine, who either in hypocrisy eat that flesh and drink that blood, or who after they have eaten and drunk become <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, do they <q>dwell in Christ or Christ in them</q>? Yet assuredly there is a certain manner of eating that Flesh and drinking that Blood, in which whosoever eats and drinks, <q>he dwells in Christ and Christ in him.</q> As then he does not <q>dwell in Christ and Christ in him,</q> who <q>eats the Flesh and drinks the Blood of Christ</q> in any manner whatsoever, but only in some certain manner, to which He doubtless had regard when He spoke these words. So in this expression also, <q>He that shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has never forgiveness,</q> he is not guilty of this unpardonable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, who shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> in any way whatever, but in that particular way, which it is His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, who uttered this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and terrible sentence, that we should seek out and understand.</p>

<p>18. Now as to what that mode, or immoderateness  rather, of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is, what that particular <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and what that word against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the order of my discourse requires me to say what I think, and not to put off any longer your expectation which has been so long but so necessarily deferred. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, Dearly beloved, that in that invisible and incorruptible Trinity, which our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> maintains and preaches, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is not the Father of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but of the Son; and that God the Son is not the Son of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but of the Father; but that God the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is the Spirit not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. And that this Trinity, although the  Property and particular  Subsistence  of each person is preserved, is yet, because of the undivided and inseparable Essence or Nature of Eternity,  Truth, and Goodness, not three Gods but One God. And by this means, according to our capacity, and as far as it is granted us to see these things <q>through a glass darkly,</q> especially being such as we now are, there is conveyed to  us the idea of Origination  in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Nativity in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Communion of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and in the Three Equality. By That then which is the Bond of communion  between the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, it is Their pleasure that we should have communion both among ourselves and with Them, and to gather us together in one by that same Gift, which One They both have, that is, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, at once God and the Gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For in This are we reconciled to the Divinity, and take delight in It. For what would the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of whatever good we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> profit us, unless we also loved it? But as it is by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that we learn, so is it by charity that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that so we may attain also to a fuller <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and enjoy in blessedness what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. <q>Love moreover is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which is given unto us.</q>  And because it is through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that we are alienated from the possession of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> good, <q>Love covers a multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q>  So then the Father is Himself the True Origin  to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who is the Truth, and the Son is the Truth, originating  from the True Father, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is Goodness, shed abroad  from the Good Father and the Good Son; but in all Three the Divinity is equal, and the Unity Inseparable.</p>

<p>19. First then in order to our receiving <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life which shall be given at the last, there comes to us a gift from God's goodness from the beginning of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to wit, the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For while they remain, there remains in some sort enmity against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and alienation from Him, which comes from what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in us; since Scripture does not speak <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, which says, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> separate between you and God.</q>  He does not then bestow on us His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, except He take away our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things. And the former increase in proportion as the latter are diminished; nor will the one be perfected, till the other be brought to an end. But now that the Lord Jesus forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, just as by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> He casts out devils, may be understood by this, that after His Resurrection from the dead, when He had said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> He immediately subjoined, <q>Whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye remit, they shall be remitted unto them, and whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye retain, they shall be retained.</q>  For that regeneration also, in which there is a remission of all past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is wrought by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as the Lord says, <q>Unless a man be born of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q>  But it is one thing to be born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, another to be nourished by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; just as it is one thing to be born of the flesh, which happens when the mother is delivered of her child; another to be nourished by the flesh, which happens when she gives suck to her infant, who turns himself that he may drink with pleasure there whence he was born, to have life; that he may receive the support of life from thence, whence he received the beginning of his birth. We must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> then that the first blessing of God's goodness in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Whence the preaching of John the Baptist, who was sent as the forerunner of the Lord, also begins with it. For thus it is written, <q>In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Jud&aelig;a, saying, Repent ye, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand.</q>  Hence too the beginning of our Lord's preaching, as we read, <q>From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand.</q>  Now John, among the other things which he spoke to those who came to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him, said, <q>I indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with water unto repentance; but He that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; He shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and with fire.</q>  The Lord also said, <q>John <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water, but you shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> not many days hence,</q>  even at Pentecost. Now as to John's expression, <q>with fire,</q> though tribulation also might be understood, which <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> were to suffer for the name of Christ; yet may we reasonably think that the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is signified also under the name of <q>fire.</q>  Wherefore when He came it is said, <q>And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.</q>  Hence also the Lord Himself said, <q>I have come to send fire on the earth.</q>  Hence also the Apostle says, <q>Fervent in the spirit;</q>  for from Him comes the fervour of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. <q>For it is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which is given unto us.</q>  And the contrary to this fervour is what the Lord said, <q>The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of many shall wax cold.</q>  Now perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is the perfect gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But the first <q>gift</q> is that which is concerned with the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; by which blessing <q>we are delivered from the power of darkness;</q>  and the prince of this world,  who works in the children of disobedience  by no other power than the fellowship and the bond of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is <q>cast out</q> by our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, by whom the people of God are gathered together into one, is the unclean spirit who is divided against himself cast out.</p>

<p>20. Against this gratuitous gift, against this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does the impenitent heart speak. This impenitence then is <q>the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which shall not be forgiven, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</q> For against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, by whom they whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are all forgiven are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has received, that <q>whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> she remits, they may be remitted,</q> does he speak, whether in the thought only, or also in the tongue, a very heinous and exceedingly ungodly word, who <q>when the patience of God leads him to repentance, after his hardness and impenitent heart treasures up unto himself <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> against the day of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and revelation of the righteous judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who will render to every man according to his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</q>  This impenitence then, for so by some one general name may we call both this <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and the word against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which has no forgiveness for ever; this impenitence, I say, against which both the herald and the Judge cried out, saying, <q>Repent ye, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand;</q>  against which the Lord first opened the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> preaching, and against which He foretold that the same <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was to be preached in all the world, when He said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> from the dead, <q>it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day, and that repentance and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be preached in His Name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem:</q>  this impenitence, in one word, has no forgiveness <q>neither in this world, nor in the world to come;</q> for that repentance only obtains forgiveness in this world, that it may have its effect in the world to come.</p>

<p>21. But this impenitence or impenitent heart may not be pronounced  upon, as long as a man lives in the flesh. For we are not to despair of any so long as <q>the patience of God leads the ungodly to repentance,</q> and does not hurry him out of this life; <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who wills not the death of a sinner, but that he should return from his ways and live.</q>  He is a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> today; but how do you know whether he may not be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tomorrow? He is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> today; but what if tomorrow he follow the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? He is a schismatic today; but what if tomorrow he embrace <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> peace? What if they, whom you observe now in any kind of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that can be, and whom you condemn as in most desperate case, what if before they end this life, they repent and find the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life in that which is to come? Wherefore, Brethren, let also what the Apostle says urge you to this. <q>Judge nothing before the time.</q>  For this <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, for which there is no forgiveness (which I have understood to be not every kind of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, but a particular sort, and that as I have said or discovered, or even as I think clearly shown to be the case, the persevering hardness of an impenitent heart), cannot be taken hold of in any one, I repeat it, as long as he is still in this life.</p>

<p>22. And let it not seem absurd, that whereas a man who perseveres in hardened impenitence even to the end of this life, speaks long and much against this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; yet the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> has called this so long contradiction of an impenitent heart, as though it were something of short duration, <q>a word,</q> saying, <q>Whosoever speaks a word against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaks against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</q> For though this <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> be long continued, and made up of, and drawn out at length in very many words, yet it is the manner of Scripture to call even many words <q>a word.</q> For no <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> ever spoke one word only; yet we read, <q>the <em>word</em> which came to such and such a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</q> And the Apostle says, <q>Let the elders be counted worthy of double <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.</q>  He does not say, <q>in words,</q> but, <q>in the word.</q> And St. James, <q>Be doers of the word, and not hearers only.</q>  He again does not say, <q>of the words,</q> but, <q>of the word;</q> although so many words out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> are read, and spoken, and heard in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at her celebrations and solemnities. As therefore, how long a time soever any of us have laboured in preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, he is not called a preacher of the words, but of the word; and how long time soever any of you may have attentively and diligently listened to our preaching, he is called a most earnest <q>hearer</q> not of the words, but <q>of the word;</q> so after the style of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> and the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whoso throughout his whole life in the flesh, to whatever length it may be extended, shall have spoken no matter how many words, whether by mouth, or the thought only with an impenitent heart, against that remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which is granted in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he speaks <q>a word</q> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</p>

<p>23. Therefore not only every word spoken against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, but, in fact, every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> shall be forgiven unto men; because where there is not this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of an impenitent heart against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by whom <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, all other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven. But how shall that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be forgiven, which hinders the forgiveness of other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> also? All <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> then are forgiven to them in whom is not this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which shall never be forgiven; but to him in whom it is, since this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is never forgiven, neither are other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> forgiven; because the remission of all is hindered by the bond of this one. It is not then that <q>whosoever speaks a word against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> shall be forgiven,</q> but <q>whoso speaks against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall not be forgiven,</q> for that in the Trinity the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is greater than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, which no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> even has ever maintained; but since whosoever he be that resists the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and blasphemes the Truth, which is Christ, even after such a manifestation of Himself among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as that the Word who is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> and very Christ, <q>became flesh and dwelt among us;</q> if he have not also spoken that word of the impenitent heart against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, of whom it is said, <q>Unless a man be born of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>;</q>  and again, <q>Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye remit they are remitted unto them;</q>  that is, if he shall repent, he shall thereby receive the gift of the remission of all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and of this also, that he <q>has spoken a word against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>,</q> because to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, or obstinacy, or <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of whatever kind, he has not added the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of impenitence against the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of regeneration or reconciliation, which is conferred in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>24. Wherefore, neither must we <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, as some do, that the word which is spoken against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> is forgiven, but that which is spoken against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not forgiven, because Christ became the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> by reason of His assuming flesh, in which respect the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> of course is greater, who in His Own Substance is equal to the Father and the Only-begotten Son according to His Divinity, according to which also the Only-begotten Son Himself is equal to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For if this were the reason, surely nothing would have been said of any other kind of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, that that only might appear capable of forgiveness, which is spoken against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, regarded only as man. But forasmuch as it is first said, <q>All manner of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> shall be forgiven unto men;</q>  which in another Evangelist is also thus expressed, <q>All <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shall be forgiven unto the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> wherewithsoever they shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>;</q>  without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> also which is spoken against the Father is included in that general expression; and yet that alone is laid down as unpardonable, which is spoken against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. What! Did the Father also take the form of a servant, that in this respect the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> should be greater than He? No surely: but after the universal mention of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and of all <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, He wished to express more prominently the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> which is spoken against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> for this reason, because although men should be even bound in that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which He mentioned when He said, <q>If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>:</q>  which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John He shows to be a very grievous one, when He says of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> Himself, when He promised that He would send Him, <q>He shall reprove the world of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not on Me:</q>  yet if that hardness of the impenitent heart have not spoken a word against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, even this which is spoken against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> shall be forgiven.</p>

<p>25. Here perhaps some one may ask, <q>whether the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> only forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and not the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> also?</q> I answer, Both the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> forgive them. For the Son Himself says of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</q>  And we say to Him in the Lord's Prayer, <q>Our Father, which art in heaven.</q>  And among the other petitions we ask this, saying, <q>Forgive us our debts.</q>  And again of Himself He says, <q>That ye may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> has power on earth to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q>  <q>If then,</q> you will say, <q>The Father, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, why is that impenitence which shall never be forgiven, said to relate only to the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as though he who should be bound in this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of impenitence should seem to resist the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, because by that gift is wrought the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>?</q> Now on this point, I will also ask, Whether Christ only cast out devils, or the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also? For if Christ only, what means His saying, <q>The Father that dwells in Me, He does the works.</q>  For so it is said, <q>He does the works,</q> as if the Son does them not, but the Father who dwells in the Son. Why then in another place does He say, <q>My Father works hitherto, and I work.</q>  And a little after, <q>For what things soever He does, these also does the Son likewise.</q>  But when in another place He says, <q>If I had not done among them the works which none other man did,</q>  He speaks as if He did them alone. Now if these things are so expressed, as that nevertheless the works of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are inseparable, what must we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but that He also works equally with them? For in that very place, from which this question arose which we are discussing, when the Son was casting out devils, He yet said, <q>If I in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> cast out devils, then the kingdom of God has come unto you.</q> </p>

<p>26. And here perhaps one may say, That the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is rather given by the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, than that He works anything by His own will, and that this is the scope of the words, <q>In the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> I cast out devils,</q> because not the Spirit Himself, but Christ in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, did it; so that the expression, <q>I cast out in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,</q> might be understood as if it were said, <q>I cast out by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> For this is the usual style of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, <q>They killed in the sword,</q> that is, by the sword. They <q>burnt in the fire,</q>  that is, by the fire. <q>And Joshua took knives of flints, in which to circumcise,</q> that is, by which to circumcise, <q>the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q>  But let those who on this account take from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> His proper power, look to that which we read to have been spoken by the Lord, <q>The Spirit blows where It lists.</q>  And as to what the Apostle says, <q>But all these works that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will;</q>  it might be feared, lest one <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> do not work them: whereas among these works he has expressly mentioned both the <q>gifts of healings,</q> and the <q>workings of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>,</q> in which surely is included also the driving out of devils. But when he adds the words, <q>Dividing to every man severally as He will;</q> does he not clearly show also the Power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, yet as plainly inseparable from the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>? If then these things are so expressed, as that notwithstanding the operation of the Trinity is understood to be inseparable: so that when the operation of the Father is spoken of, it is understood that He does not exercise it without the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and when the operation of the Son is spoken of, it is not without the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and when the operation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is spoken of, it is not without the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; it is sufficiently clear to those who have a sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or who even understand as they best can, both that the words, <q>He does the works,</q>  are spoken of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in that from Him is also  the first principle of the works, from whom is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the Persons who co-operate in working: for that both the Son is born of Him, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> proceeds from Him, as the First Beginning, of whom the Son is born, and with whom He has one Spirit in common; and again that when the Lord said, <q>If I had not done among them the works which none other did,</q>  He did not speak in reference to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as that They did not co-operate with Him in those works; but to men by whom we read of many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> having been done, but by none such <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> as the Son did. And what the Apostle says of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, <q>But all these works that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will,</q> is not said, because the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> do not co-operate with Him; but because in these works there are not many spirits, but One Spirit, and in His various operations He is not diverse from Himself.</p>

<p>27.  And yet it is not without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but with reason and with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> said, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and not the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, said, <q>You are My beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased.</q>  Nevertheless, we do not deny that the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> co-operated in working this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the voice sounding from heaven, though we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it belongs to the Person of the Father only. For though the Son bearing flesh, was there conversing with men on earth, He was not the less on that account in the Bosom of the Father also as the Only-Begotten Word, when that Voice came out of the cloud; nor could it be either wisely and through the Spirit  <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father separated the operation of these audible and passing words from the co-operation of His Wisdom and His Spirit. In the same way when we say most rightly, that not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but the Son walked upon the sea, who only had that flesh and those feet which rested on the waves;  yet who would deny that the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> co-operated in the work of so great a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>? For so again we say most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> that the Son only took this our flesh, not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and yet he has no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom who denies that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> co-operated in the work of His Incarnation which belongs only to the Son. So also we say that neither the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> only appeared both in the <q>form of a dove,</q>  and in <q>tongues as it were of fire;</q>  and gave to those to whom He came the power to tell in many and various tongues <q>the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and yet from this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> which regards the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> only, we cannot separate the co-operation of the Father and the Only-Begotten Word. So also the Whole Trinity work the works of each several Person in the Trinity, the Two co-operating in the work of the Other, through a perfect harmony of operation in the Three, and not through any deficiency of the power to work effectually in One. And since this is so, hence it is that the Lord Jesus cast out devils in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Not that He was not able to accomplish this alone, or that He assumed that aid as being insufficient for this work; but it was meet that the spirit who is divided against himself should be driven out by that Spirit, which the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> who are not divided in themselves have in common.</p>

<p>28. And thus <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because they are not forgiven out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, must be forgiven by that Spirit, by whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is gathered together into one. In fact, if any one out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> repent him of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and for this so great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whereby he is an alien from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, has an heart impenitent, what does that other repentance profit him? Seeing by this alone he speaks a word against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, whereby he is alienated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which has received this gift, that in her remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be given in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? Which remission though it be the work of the Whole Trinity, is yet understood specially to belong to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For He is the Spirit of the adoption of sons, <q>in whom we cry Abba, Father;</q>  that we may be able to say to Him, <q>Forgive us our debts.</q>  And, <q>Hereby we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a></q> as the Apostle John says, <q>that Christ dwells in us, by His Spirit which He has given us.</q>  <q>The Spirit Itself bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> with our spirit that we are the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  For to Him appertains the fellowship, by which we are made the one body of the One only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Whence it is written, <q>If there be therefore any consolation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, if any comfort of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, if any fellowship of the Spirit.</q>  With a view to this fellowship they to whom He first came spoke with the tongues of all nations. Because as by tongues the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> is more closely united; so it behooved that this fellowship of the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and members of Christ which was to be among all nations should be signified by the tongues of all nations; that as at that time he was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who spoke with the tongues of all nations; so now he should acknowledge that he has received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who is held by the bond of the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is spread throughout all nations. Whence the Apostle says, <q>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</q> </p>

<p>29. Now that He is the Spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the Son Himself says, <q>He proceeds from the Father.</q>  And in another place, <q>For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you.</q>  And that He is the Spirit of the Son also the Apostle says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has sent the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, Abba Father;</q>  that is, making you cry. For it is we that cry; but in Him, that is, by His shedding abroad <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in our hearts, without which whoso cries, cries in vain. Whence he says again, <q>If any man have not the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he is none of His.</q>  To which Person then in the Trinity could the communion of this fellowship peculiarly appertain, but to that Spirit which is common to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>?</p>

<p>30. That they who have separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have not this Spirit, the Apostle Jude has declared most plainly, saying, <q>Who separate themselves, natural, having not the Spirit.</q>  Whence the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> reproving those even in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, who by the names of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, though having a place in her unity, were raising a kind of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, says among other things, <q>But the natural man perceives not the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, because they are spiritually discerned.</q>  This shows his meaning, <q>does not perceive,</q> that is does not receive the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. These as having a place in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he speaks of as babes, not yet spiritual, but still carnal, and such as are to be fed with milk, not with meat. <q>Even,</q> he says, <q>as unto babes in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, have I given you milk and not meat; for hitherto you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able.</q>  When we say, <q>not yet,</q> we must not despair, if that which is <q>not yet</q> tends to be. For he says, <q>you are yet carnal.</q> And showing how it is that they are carnal, he says, <q>For whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you not carnal, and walk as men?</q> And again more plainly, <q>For while one says, I am of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and another, I of Apollos, are you not carnal? Who then is <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>?</q>  These then, that is, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Apollos, agreed together in the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace; and yet because the Corinthians began to divide them among themselves, and <q>to be puffed up for one against another,</q> they are said to be men&mdash; carnal and natural men, not able to receive the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>; and yet because they are not separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they are called <q>babes in Christ;</q> for indeed he desired that they should be either Angels, or even Gods, whom he reproved because they were men, that is, in those contentions, <q>They savoured not the things which be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the things which be of men.</q>  But of those who are separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> it is not merely said, <q>perceiving not the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>,</q> lest it should be referred to the perception of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; but it is said, <q>Having not the Spirit.</q> For it does not follow, that he who has it, should also by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> perceive what he has.</p>

<p>31. The <q>babes</q> then <q>in Christ</q> who have yet place in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who are still natural and carnal, and cannot <q>perceive,</q> that is, understand and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what they have, have this Spirit. For how could they be babes in Christ except they were born anew of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? Nor ought it to seem any wonder that one may have something, and yet not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he has. For to say nothing of the Divinity of the Almighty, and the Unity of the Unchangeable Trinity, who can easily perceive by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> what the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is; and yet who is there that has not a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Finally, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> most certainly that <q>babes in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> who do not <q>perceive the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>,</q> have notwithstanding the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>; let us look how the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, when a little while after he is rebuking them, says, <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are the temples of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwells in you?</q>  This surely he would in no wise say to those who are separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who are described as <q>having not the Spirit.</q></p>

<p>32. But neither can he be said to be in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to belong to that fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, who is mixed up with Christ's sheep by a bodily intercourse only in deceitfulness of heart. For the <q><a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of discipline will flee deceit.</q>  Wherefore whosoever are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the congregations or separations rather  of schismatics or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, although they have not been born again of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, like as it were to Ishmael, who was <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> son after the flesh; not like Isaac, who was his son after the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>,  because by promise; yet when they come to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and are joined to the fellowship of the Spirit which without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> they beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> had not, the washing of the flesh is not repeated in their case. For <q>this form of godliness</q> was not wanting to them even when they were without; but there is added to them <q>the Unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</q> which cannot be given but within. Before they were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> indeed, they were as they of whom the Apostle says, <q>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.</q>  For the visible form of the branch may exist even when separated from the vine; but the invisible life of the root cannot be had, but in the vine. Wherefore the bodily <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which even they who are separated from the Unity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Body bear and celebrate, may give <q>the form of godliness;</q> but the invisible and spiritual power of godliness cannot in any wise be in them, just as sensation does not accompany a man's limb, when it is amputated from the body.</p>

<p>33. And since this is so, remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, seeing it is not given but by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, can only be given in that Church which has the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For this is the effect of the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that the prince of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the spirit who is divided against himself, should no more reign in us, and that being delivered from the power of the unclean spirit, we should thenceforward be made the temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and receive Him, by whom we are cleansed through receiving pardon, to dwell in us, to work, increase, and perfect righteousness. For at His first coming, when they who had received Him spoke with the tongues of all nations, and the Apostle Peter addressed those who were present in amazement, they were pricked in heart, and said to Peter and to the rest of the Apostles, <q>Men and brethren, what shall we do?</q> show us. <q>And Peter said to them, Repent, and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> every one of you in the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and you shall receive the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q>  In the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> in which was the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, were both brought to pass, that is, both the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the receiving of this gift. And therefore was it <q>In the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>;</q> because when He promised the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; He said, <q>Whom the Father will send in My Name.</q>  For the Spirit dwells in no man without the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; as neither does the Son without the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, nor the Father without them. Their indwelling is inseparable, as their operation is inseparable; but sometimes they manifest themselves separately by <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>  borrowed from the creatures, not in their own substance; just as they are pronounced separately by the voice in syllables which occupy separately their own spaces, and yet they are not separated from each other by any intervals, or moments of time. For they never can be pronounced together, whereas they can never exist, except together. But as I have already said, and not once only, the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, whereby the kingdom of the spirit which is divided against himself is overthrown and driven out, and the fellowship of the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, out of which this remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is not, are regarded as the peculiar work of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, with the cooperation doubtless of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is Himself in some sort the fellowship of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. For the Father is not possessed  as Father by the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in common; because He is not the Father of Both. And the Son is not possessed as Son by the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in common; because He is not the Son of Both. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is possessed as the Spirit by the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> in common, because He is the One Spirit of Both.</p>

<p>34. Whosoever therefore shall be guilty of impenitence against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, in whom the unity and fellowship of the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is gathered together, shall never have forgiveness; because he has stopped the source of forgiveness against himself, and deservedly shall he be condemned with the spirit, which is divided against himself, who is himself also divided against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> which is not divided against Himself. And of this the very testimonies of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> warn us, would we with good attention search them. For according to Luke the Lord does not say, <q>That he who blasphemes against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall not be forgiven:</q> in that place where He is answering those who said that He cast out devils by the prince of the devils. Whence it would seem that this was not said once only by the Lord; but we must not carelessly pass over the consideration of the occasion on which this last also was spoken. For He was speaking of those who should have confessed or denied Him before men, when He said, <q>Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess Me before men, him shall the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> also confess before the Angels of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But he that denies Me before men, shall be denied before the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  And lest from this the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the Apostle Peter should be despaired of, he immediately subjoined, <q>And whosoever shall speak a word against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, it shall be forgiven him; but unto him that blasphemes against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven;  blasphemes,</q> that is, with that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of an impenitent heart, by which resistance is made to remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which is granted in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And this <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> Peter had not, who presently repented, when <q>he wept bitterly,</q>  and who after he had overcome the spirit who is divided against himself, and who had desired to <q>have him to harass him,</q>  and against whom the <q>Lord <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for him that his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might not fail,</q> even received the Very <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> whom he resisted not, that not only his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might be forgiven him, but that through him remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> might be preached and dispensed.</p>

<p>35. And in the narrative of the two other Evangelists, the occasion of speaking out this sentence of the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the Spirit arose from the mention of the unclean spirit, who is divided against himself. For it had been said of the Lord, that <q>He cast out devils by the prince of the devils.</q> In that place the Lord says, that <q>by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> He casts out devils,</q> that so the spirit who is not divided against Himself may overcome and cast out him who is divided against himself; but that that man would abide in his perdition, who refuses through impenitence to pass over into His peace, who is not divided against Himself. For thus runs the narrative of Mark; <q>Verily I say unto you, All <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shall be forgiven unto the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> wherewith soever they shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>; but he that shall <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has never forgiveness, but shall be held guilty of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> offense.</q>  When he had delivered these words of the Lord, he then subjoined his own, saying, <q>Because they said He has an unclean spirit;</q>  that He might show that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His saying this arose hence, because they had said that <q>He cast out devils by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> the prince of the devils.</q> Not that this was a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> which shall not be forgiven, forasmuch as even this shall be forgiven, if a right repentance follow it; but because, as I have said, there arose hence a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for that sentence to be delivered by the Lord, since mention had been made of the unclean spirit whom the Lord shows to be divided against himself, because of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> who is not only not divided against Himself, but who also makes those whom He gathers together undivided, by forgiving those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are divided against themselves, and by inhabiting those who are cleansed, that it may be with them, as it is written in the Acts of the Apostles, <q>The multitude of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> were of one heart and of one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q>  And this gift of forgiveness none resists, but he who has the hardness of an impenitent heart. For in another place also the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said of the Lord that He had a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>,  yet He spoke nothing there of the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; because they did not so bring forward the mention of the unclean spirit as that he could be shown out of their own mouths to be divided against himself, as <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, by whom they said that devils could be cast out.</p>

<p>36. But in this passage according to Matthew, the Lord far more plainly explained what he intended to be understood here; namely, that he it is who speaks a word against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who with an impenitent heart resists the Unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, where in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is given the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For this spirit they have not, as has been said already, who even though they bear and handle  the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are separated from His congregation. For when He spoke of the division of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> against <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, and how that He Himself cast out devils by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, that Spirit, namely, which is not, as the other, divided against Himself; lest any one should think because of those who gather together their irregular assemblies  under the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but without His fold, that the kingdom of Christ also was divided against itself, He immediately added, <q>He that is not with Me is against Me, and he that gathers not with Me scatters abroad,</q>  that He might show that they did not belong to Him who by gathering <q>without</q> wished not to <q>gather</q> but <q>to scatter abroad.</q> And afterwards He subjoined, <q>Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> shall be forgiven unto men; but the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the Spirit shall not be forgiven.</q>  What is this <q>wherefore?</q> Shall the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the Spirit only not be forgiven, because <q>he who is not with Christ is against Him, and he who gathers not with Him scatters abroad?</q> Even so, doubtless. For he that gathers not with Him, howsoever he may gather under His name, has not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</p>

<p>37. Thus then has He altogether forced us to understand that the remission of no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> nor <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> can be effected anywhere else, save in the gathering together of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which scatters not abroad. For it is gathered together in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which is not as that unclean spirit, divided against Himself. And therefore all congregations, or dispersions rather, which call themselves Churches of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and are divided against themselves and contrary one to the other, and hostile to the congregation of Unity, which is His True Church, do not therefore belong to His congregation, because they seem to have His Name. But they might belong to it, if the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in whom this congregation is joined together, were divided against Himself. But because this is not so (<q>for he that is not with Christ is against Him, and he that gathers not with Him scatters abroad</q>); therefore all manner of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and all <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> shall be forgiven unto men in this congregation, which Christ gathers together in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who is not divided against Himself. But that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the Spirit Himself, whereby in an impenitent heart resistance is made to this so great gift of God even to the end of this present life, shall not be forgiven. For though a man so oppose himself to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as to resist God speaking, not in the Prophets, but in His Only Son (since for our sakes He was pleased that He should be the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, that He might speak to us in Him), yet shall he be forgiven when in repentance he shall have recourse to the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who forasmuch as He <q>wills not the death of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but rather that he should turn from his way and live,</q>  has given the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to His Church, that whosoever forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, they should be forgiven. But whoso stands out as an enemy to this gift, so as not in repentance to seek it, but by impenitence to gainsay it, his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> becomes unpardonable; not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of any one specific kind, but the contempt, or even opposing of the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> itself. And so a word is spoken against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, when men never come from the dispersion to the congregation which has received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Unto which congregation if any come without hypocrisy, though it be through the ministry of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, a reprobate and a hypocrite, so he be a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> minister, he shall receive remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in this <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For such is the working of this Spirit in the Holy Church, even in this present time, when the grain  is as it were being threshed with the chaff, that he despises no man's sincere confession, and is deceived by no man's false pretences, and so flies from the reprobate, as yet by their ministry to gather together those that are approved.  One refuge then there is against unpardonable <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, that we take heed of an impenitent heart; and that it be not thought that repentance can avail ought, unless the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be kept to, in which remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is given, and the fellowship of the Spirit is preserved in the bond of peace.</p>

<p>38. I have through the mercy and assistance of the Lord handled, as I best was able, this most difficult question, if indeed I have been able to do it in any measure. Nevertheless, whatever I have not been able to apprehend in the difficulties  of it, let it not be imputed to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, which is a healthful exercise to the godly, even when it is hidden, but to my infirmity, who either could not see what others might have understood, or could not explain what I did understand. But for that which perhaps I have been able to discover by force of meditation, and to develop in words, to Him must the thanks be given, from whom I have sought, from whom I have asked, unto whom I have knocked, that I might have wherewithal to be nourished myself in meditation, and to minister to you in speaking.</p>
