<h1>Sermon 22</h1>

<p> <em>On the Feast of the Nativity, II.</em></p>

<h2>I. The mystery of the Incarnation demands our joy</h2>

<p>Let us be glad in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, dearly-beloved, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with spiritual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> that there has dawned for us the day of ever-new redemption, of ancient preparation , of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> bliss. For as the year rolls round, there recurs for us the commemoration  of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which promised from the beginning, accomplished in the fullness of time will endure for ever; on which we are bound with hearts up-lifted  to adore the divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>: so that what is the effect of God's great gift may be celebrated by the Church's great rejoicings. For God the almighty and merciful, Whose nature as goodness, Whose will is power, Whose work is mercy: as soon as the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> malignity killed us by the poison of his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, foretold at the very beginning of the world the remedy His <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> had prepared for the restoration of us mortals: proclaiming to the serpent that the seed of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should come to crush the lifting of his baneful head by its power, signifying no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that Christ would come in the flesh, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, Who born of a Virgin should by His uncorrupt birth condemn the despoiler of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> stock.  Thus in the whole and perfect nature of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God born, complete in what was His own, complete in what was ours. And <q>ours</q> we call what the Creator formed in us from the beginning and what He undertook to repair. For what the deceiver brought in and the deceived admitted had no trace in the Saviour. Nor because He partook of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> weaknesses, did He therefore share our faults. He took the form of a slave without stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, increasing the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and not diminishing the Divine: because that <q>emptying of Himself</q> whereby the Invisible made Himself visible and Creator and Lord of all things as He was, wished to be mortal, was the condescension of Pity not the failing of Power. </p>

<h2>II. The new character of the birth of Christ explained</h2>

<p>Therefore, when the time came, dearly beloved, which had been fore-ordained for men's redemption , there enters these lower parts of the world, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, descending from His heavenly throne and yet not quitting His Father's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, begotten in a new order, by a new nativity. In a new order, because being invisible in His own nature He became visible in ours, and He whom nothing could contain, was content to be contained: abiding before all time He began to be in time: the Lord of all things, He obscured His immeasurable majesty and took on Him the form of a servant: being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that cannot suffer, He did not disdain to be man that can, and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> as He is, to subject Himself to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of death.  And by a new nativity He was begotten, conceived by a Virgin, born of a Virgin, without paternal desire, without injury to the mother's <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>: because such a birth as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no taint of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, became One who was to be the Saviour of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, while it possessed in itself the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> substance. For when God was born in the flesh, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself was the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as the archangel witnessed to the Blessed Virgin Mary: <q>because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> shall come upon you, and the power of the most High shall overshadow you: and therefore, that which shall be born of you shall be called <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360739"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;1:35</a></span> .</q> The origin is different but the nature like: not by intercourse with man but by the power of God was it brought about: for a Virgin conceived, a Virgin bare, and a Virgin she remained. Consider here not the condition of her that bare but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that was born; for He was born Man as He willed and was able. If you inquire into the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His nature, you must acknowledge the matter to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>: if you search for the mode of His birth, you must confess the power to be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> came to do away with not to endure our pollutions: not to succumb to our faults but to heal them.  He came that He might cure every weakness of our corruptness and all the sores of our defiled <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: for which reason it behooved Him to be born by a new order, who brought to men's bodies the new gift of unsullied purity. For the uncorrupt nature of Him that was born had to guard the primal <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of the Mother, and the infused power of the Divine Spirit had to preserve in spotlessness and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> that sanctuary which He had chosen for Himself: that Spirit (I say) who had determined to raise the fallen, to restore the broken, and by overcoming the allurements of the flesh to bestow on us in abundant measure the power of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>: in order that the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> which in others cannot be retained in child-bearing, might be attained by them at their second birth.</p>

<h2>III. Justice required that Satan should be vanquished by God made man</h2>

<p>And, dearly beloved, this very fact that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> chose to be born of a Virgin does it not appear to be part of the deepest design? I mean, that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> should not be aware that Salvation had been born for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and through the obscurity of that spiritual conception, when he saw Him no different to others, should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him born in no different way to others. For when he observed that His nature was like that of all others, he thought that He had the same origin as all had: and did not understand that He was free from the bonds of transgression because he did not find Him a stranger to the weakness of mortality. For though the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>  mercy of God had infinitely many schemes to hand for the restoration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, it chose that particular design which put in force for destroying the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> work, not the efficacy of might but the dictates of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of the ancient foe not undeservedly made good its despotic rights over all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and with no unwarrantable supremacy tyrannized over those who had been of their own accord lured away from God's commands to be the slaves of his will. And so there would be no <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in his losing the immemorial slavery of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, were he not conquered by that which he had subjugated. And to this end, without male seed Christ was conceived of a Virgin, who was fecundated not by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> intercourse but by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. And whereas in all mothers conception does not take place without stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this one received purification from the Source of her conception. For no taint of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> penetrated, where no intercourse occurred. Her unsullied <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> when it ministered the substance. The Lord took from His mother our nature, not our fault.  The slave's form is created without the slave's estate, because the New Man is so commingled with the old, as both to assume the reality of our race and to remove its ancient flaw.</p>

<h2>IV. The Incarnation deceived the Devil and caused him to break the bond under which he held men</h2>

<p>When, therefore, the merciful and almighty Saviour so arranged the commencement of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> course as to hide the power of His Godhead which was inseparable from His manhood under the veil of our weakness, the crafty foe was taken off his guard and he thought that the nativity of the Child, Who was born for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, was as much subject to himself as all others are at their birth. For he saw Him crying and weeping, he saw Him wrapped in swaddling clothes, subjected to <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, offering the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> which the law required. And then he perceived in Him the usual growth of boyhood, and could have had no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of His reaching man's estate by natural steps. Meanwhile, he inflicted insults, multiplied injuries, made use of curses, affronts, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, abuse, in a word, poured upon Him all the force of his fury and exhausted all the varieties of trial: and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how he had poisoned man's nature, had no conception that He had no share in the first transgression Whose mortality he had ascertained by so many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>. The unscrupulous thief and greedy robber persisted in assaulting Him Who had nothing of His own, and in carrying out the general sentence on original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, went beyond the bond on which he rested , and required the punishment of iniquity from Him in Whom he found no fault. And thus the malevolent terms of the deadly compact are annulled, and through the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of an overcharge the whole debt is cancelled. The strong one is bound by his own chains, and every device of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one recoils on his own head. When the prince of the world is bound, all that he held in captivity is released.  Our nature cleansed from its old contagion regains its <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> estate, death is destroyed by death, nativity is restored by nativity: since at one and the same time redemption does away with slavery, regeneration changes our origin, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> justifies the sinner.</p>

<h2>V. The Christian is exhorted to share in the blessings of the Incarnation</h2>

<p>Whoever then you are that devoutly and faithfully boastest of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name, estimate this atonement at its right worth. For to you who wast a castaway, banished from the realms of paradise, dying of your weary exile, reduced to dust and ashes, without further hope of living, by the Incarnation of the Word was given the power to return from afar to your Maker, to recognize your parentage, to become free after slavery, to be promoted from being an outcast to sonship: so that, you who were born of corruptible flesh, may be reborn by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and obtain through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> what you had not by nature, and, if you acknowledge yourself the son of God by the spirit of adoption, dare to call God Father. Freed from the accusings of a bad <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, aspire to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, do <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> supported by the Divine help, imitate the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> upon earth, feed on the strength of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> sustenance, fight fearlessly on the side of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> against hostile <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, and if you keep your allegiance  in the heavenly warfare, <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not that you will be crowned for your victory in the triumphant camp of the Eternal King, when the resurrection that is prepared for the faithful has raised you to participate in the heavenly Kingdom.</p>

<h2>VI. The festival has nothing to do with sun-worship, as some maintain</h2>

<p>Having therefore so confident a hope, dearly beloved, abide firm in the Faith in which you are built: lest that same tempter whose tyranny over you Christ has already destroyed, win you back again with any of his wiles, and mar even the joys of the present festival by his deceitful art, misleading simpler <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> with the pestilential notion of some to whom this our solemn feast day seems to derive its <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, not so much from the nativity of Christ as, according to them, from the rising of the new sun.  Such men's hearts are wrapped in total darkness, and have no growing perception of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light: for they are still drawn away by the foolish <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of heathendom, and because they cannot lift the eyes of their mind above that which their carnal sight beholds, they pay divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the luminaries that minister to the world. Let not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> entertain any such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> and portentous lie. Beyond all measure are things temporal removed from the Eternal, things corporeal from the Incorporeal, things governed from the Governor. For though they possess a wondrous beauty, yet they have no Godhead to be worshipped. That power then, that wisdom, that majesty is to be adored which created the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> out of nothing, and framed by His almighty methods the substance of the earth and sky into what forms and dimensions He willed. Sun, moon, and stars may be most useful to us, most fair to look upon; but only if we render thanks to their Maker for them and worship God who made them, not the creation which does Him service. Then praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, dearly beloved, in all His works and judgments. Cherish an undoubting belief in the Virgin's pure conception. Honour the sacred and Divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> restoration with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and sincere service. Embrace Christ born in our flesh, that you may deserve to see Him also as the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> reigning in His majesty, who with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> remains in the unity of the Godhead for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
