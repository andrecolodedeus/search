<h1>Sermon 23</h1>

<p> <em>On the Feast of the Nativity, III.</em></p>

<h2>I. The truths of the Incarnation never suffer from being repeated</h2>

<p>The things which are connected with the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>  of today's solemn feast are well known to you, dearly-beloved, and have frequently been heard: but as yonder visible light affords pleasure to eyes that are unimpaired, so to sound hearts does the Saviour's nativity give <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; and we must not keep silent about it, though we cannot treat of it as we ought. For we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that what Isaiah says, <q>who shall declare his generation <span class="stiki" id="note360748"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;53:8</a></span>?</q> applies not only to that <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, whereby the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is co-eternal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but also to this birth whereby <q>the Word became flesh.</q> And so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, equal and of the same nature from the Father and with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Creator and Lord of the Universe, Who is completely present everywhere, and completely exceeds all things, in the due course of time, which runs by His own disposal, chose for Himself this day on which to be born of the blessed virgin Mary for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the world, without loss of the mother's <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. For her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> was violated neither at the conception nor at the birth: <q>that it might be fulfilled,</q> as the Evangelist says, <q>which was spoken by the Lord through Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, behold the virgin shall conceive in the womb, and shall bear a son, and they shall call his name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, which is interpreted, God with us <span class="stiki" id="note360749"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;1:22-23</a></span> .</q> For this wondrous child-bearing of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin produced in her offspring one person which was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Divine , because neither substance so retained their properties that there could be any division of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in them; nor was the creature taken into partnership with its Creator in such a way that the One was the in-dweller, and the other the dwelling; but so that the one nature was blended  with the other. And although the nature which is taken is one, and that which takes is another, yet these two diverse natures come together into such close union that it is one and the same Son who says both that, as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Man, <q>He is less than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> and that, as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>He is equal with the Father.</q></p>

<h2>II. The Arians could not comprehend the union of God and man</h2>

<p>This union, dearly beloved, whereby the Creator is joined to the creature, <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> blindness could not see with the eyes of intelligence, but, not believing that the Only-begotten of God was of the same <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and substance with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, spoke of the Son's Godhead as inferior, drawing its arguments from those words which are to be referred to the <q>form of a slave,</q> in respect of which, in order to show that it belongs to no other or different person in Himself, the same <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with the same form, says, <q>The Father is greater than I <span class="stiki" id="note360752"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;14:28</a></span>,</q> just as He says with the same form, <q>I and my Father are one. </q> For in <q>the form of a slave,</q> which He took at the end of the ages for our restoration, He is inferior to the Father: but in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in which He was before the ages, He is equal to the Father. In His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> humiliation He was <q>made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the Law <span class="stiki" id="note360754"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;4:4</a></span>:</q> in His Divine majesty He abides the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, <q>through whom all things were made <span class="stiki" id="note360755"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> .</q> Accordingly, He Who in the form of God made man, in the form of a slave was made man. For both natures retain their own proper character without loss: and as the form of God did not do away with the form of a slave, so the form of a slave did not impair the form of God.  And so the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of power united to weakness, in respect of the same <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, allows the Son to be called inferior to the Father: but the Godhead, which is One in the Trinity of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, excludes all notion of inequality. For the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the Trinity has nothing temporal, nothing dissimilar in nature: Its will is one, Its substance identical, Its power equal, and yet there are not three Gods, but one God ; because it is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and inseparable unity, where there can be no diversity.  Thus in the whole and perfect nature of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God born, complete in what was His own, complete in what was ours. And by <q>ours</q> we mean what the Creator formed in us from the beginning, and what He undertook to repair. For what the deceiver brought in, and man deceived committed, had no trace in the Saviour; nor because He partook of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> weaknesses, did He therefore share our faults. He took the form of a slave without stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, increasing the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and not diminishing the divine: for that <q>emptying of Himself,</q> whereby the Invisible made Himself visible, was the bending down of pity, not the failing of power.</p>

<h2>III. The Incarnation was necessary to the taking away of sin</h2>

<p>In order therefore that we might be called to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> bliss from our original bond and from earthly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, He came down Himself to us to Whom we could not ascend, because, although there was in many the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, yet the variety of our shifting opinions was deceived by the craft of misleading <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and man's <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> was dragged into diverse and conflicting notions by a falsely-called science. But to remove this mockery, whereby men's minds were taken captive to serve the arrogant <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, the teaching of the Law was not sufficient, nor could our nature be restored merely by the Prophet.' exhortations; but the reality of redemption had to be added to moral injunctions, and our fundamentally corrupt origin had to be re-born afresh. A Victim had to be offered for our atonement Who should be both a partner of our race and free from our contamination, so that this design of God whereby it pleased Him to take away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world in the Nativity and Passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, might reach to all generations : and that we should not be disturbed but rather strengthened by these <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, which vary with the character of the times, since the Faith, whereby we live, has at no time suffered variation.</p>

<h2>IV. The blessings of the Incarnation stretch backwards as well as reach forward</h2>

<p>Accordingly let those men cease their complaints who with disloyal murmurs speak against the dispensations of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and babble about the lateness of the Lord's Nativity as if that, which was fulfilled in the last age of the world, had no bearing upon the times that are past. For the Incarnation of the Word did but contribute to the doing of that which was done : and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was never in the remotest age at a standstill. What the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> foretold, that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> announced: nor was that fulfilled too late which has always been <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. But the Wisdom and Goodness of God made us more receptive of His call by thus delaying the work which brought <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: so that what through so many ages had been foretold by many signs, many utterances, and many <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, might not be doubtful in these days of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: and that the Saviour's nativity, which was to exceed all wonders and all the measure of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, might engender in us a Faith so much the firmer, as the foretelling of it had been ancient and oft-repeated. And so it was no new counsel, no tardy pity whereby God took thought for men: but from the constitution of the world He ordained one and the same Cause of Salvation for all. For the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is ever justified, was augmented, not begun, when Christ was born: and this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of God's great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, wherewith the whole world is now filled, was so effectively presignified that those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that promise obtained no less than they, who were the actual recipients.</p>

<h2>V. The coming of Christ in our flesh corresponds with our becoming members of His body</h2>

<p>Wherefore since the loving-kindness is manifest, dearly beloved, wherewith all the riches of Divine goodness are showered on us, whose call to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life has been assisted not only by the profitable examples of those who went before, but also by the visible and bodily appearing of the Truth Itself, we are bound to keep the day of the Lord's Nativity with no <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> nor carnal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. And we shall each keep it worthily and thoroughly, if we remember of what Body we are members, and to what a Head we are joined, lest any one as an ill-fitting joint cohere not with the rest of the sacred building. Consider, dearly beloved and by the illumination of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> thoughtfully bear in mind Who it was that received us into Himself, and that we have received in us: since, as the Lord Jesus became our flesh by being born, so we also became His body by being re-born. Therefore are we both members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: and for this reason the blessed Apostle says, <q>Glorify and carry God in your body :</q> for while suggesting to us the standard of His own gentleness and humility, He fills us with that power whereby He redeemed us, as the Lord Himself promises: <q>come unto Me all you who labour and are heavy-laden, and I will refresh you. Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly of heart, and you shall find rest to your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note360763"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;11:28</a></span> </q> Let us then take the yoke, that is not heavy nor irksome, of the Truth that rules us, and let us imitate His humility, to Whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> we wish to be conformed: He Himself helping us and leading us to His promises, Who, according to His great mercy, is powerful to blot out our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and to perfect His gifts in us, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, Who lives and reigns for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
