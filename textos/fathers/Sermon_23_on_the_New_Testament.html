<h1>Sermon 23 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[LXXIII. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse19">Matthew 13:19</a> <em>, etc., where the Lord Jesus explains the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> of the sower.</em></p>

<p>1. Both yesterday and today you have heard the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> of the sower, in the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. Do ye who were present yesterday, recollect today. Yesterday we read of that sower, who when he scattered seed, <q>some fell by the way side,</q>  which the birds picked up; <q>some in stony places,</q> which dried up from the heat; <q>some among thorns, which were choked,</q> and could not bring forth fruit; and <q>other some into good ground, and it brought forth fruit, a hundred, sixty, thirty fold.</q> But today the Lord has again spoken another <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the sower, <q>who sowed good seed in his field. While men slept the enemy came, and sowed tares upon it.</q>  As long as it was only in the blade, it did not appear; but when the fruit of the good seed began to appear, <q>then appeared the tares also.</q> The servants of the householder were offended, when they saw a quantity of tares among the good wheat, and wished to root them out, but they were not suffered to do so; but it was said to them, <q>Let both grow together until the harvest.</q>  Now the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> explained this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> also; and said that He was the sower of the good seed, and He showed how that the enemy who sowed the tares was the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; the time of harvest, the end of the world; His field the whole world. And what says He? <q>In the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, to burn them, but gather the wheat into My barn.</q> Why are you so hasty, He says, you servants full of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>? You see tares among the wheat, you see <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> among the good; and you wish to root up the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ones; be quiet, it is not the time of harvest. That time will come, may it only find you wheat! Why do ye vex yourselves? Why bear impatiently the mixture of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with the good? In the field they may be with you, but they will not be so in the barn.</p>

<p>2. Now ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that those three places mentioned yesterday where the seed did not grow, <q>the way side,</q> <q>the stony ground,</q> and <q>the thorny places,</q> are the same as these <q>tares.</q> They received only a different name under a different similitude. For when similitudes are used, or the literal meaning of a term is not expressed, not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> but a similitude of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is conveyed by them. I see that but few have understood my meaning; yet it is for the benefit of all that I speak. In things visible, a way side is a way side, stony ground is stony ground, thorny places are thorny places; they are simply what they are, because the names are used in their literal sense. But in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and similitudes one thing may be called by many names; therefore there is nothing inconsistent in my telling you that that <q>way side,</q> that <q>stony ground,</q> those <q>thorny places,</q> are bad <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and that they too are the <q>tares.</q> Is not Christ called <q>the Lamb</q>? Is not Christ <q>the Lion</q> too? Among wild beasts, and cattle, a lamb is simply a lamb, and a lion, a lion: but Christ is both. The first are respectively what they are in propriety of expression; the Latter both together in a figurative sense.  Nay much more; besides this it may happen that under a figure, things very different from one another may be called by one and the same name. For what is so different as Christ and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? Yet both Christ and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> are called <q>a lion.</q> Christ is called <q>a lion:</q> <q>The Lion has prevailed of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>;</q>  and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is called a lion: <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your adversary the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> walks about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour?</q>  Both the one and the other then is a lion; the one a lion by reason of His strength; the other for his savageness; the one a lion for His <q>prevailing;</q> the other for his injuring. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> again is a serpent, <q>that old serpent;</q>  are we commanded then to imitate the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, when our Shepherd told us, <q>Be wise as serpents, and simple as doves</q>? </p>

<p>3. Accordingly I yesterday addressed <q>the way side,</q> I addressed the <q>stony ground,</q> I addressed the <q>thorny places;</q> and I said, Be changed while ye may: turn up with the plough the hard ground, cast the stones out of the field, pluck up the thorns out of it. Be loth to retain that hard heart, from which the word of God may quickly pass away and be lost. Be loth to have that lightness of soil, where the root of charity can take no deep hold. Be loth to choke the good seed which is sown in you by my labours, with the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> and the cares of this world. For it is the Lord who sows; and we are only His labourers. But be ye the <q>good ground.</q> I said yesterday, and I say again today to all, Let one bring forth <q>a hundred, another sixty, another thirty fold.</q> In one the fruit is more, in another less; but all will have a place in the barn. Yesterday I said all this, today I am addressing the tares; but the sheep themselves are the tares. O <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, O you, who in filling only press the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> lives; amend yourselves before the harvest come. <q>Say not, I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and what has befallen me?</q>  God has not lost His power; but He is requiring repentance from you. I say this to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, who yet are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; I say this to the tares. For they are in the field; and it may so be, that they who today are tares, may tomorrow be wheat. And so I will address the wheat also.</p>

<p>4. O you <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, whose lives are good, you sigh and groan as being few among many, few among very many. The winter will pass away, the summer will come; lo! The harvest will soon be here. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will come who can make the separation, and who cannot make mistakes. We in this time present are like those servants of whom it was said, <q>Will You that we go and gather them up?</q>  for we were wishing, if it might be so, that no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ones should remain among the good. But it has been told us, <q>Let both grow together until the harvest.</q>  Why? For you are such as may be deceived. Hear finally; <q>Lest while you gather up the tares, you root up also the wheat with them.</q>  What good are you doing? Will ye by your eagerness make a waste of My harvest? The reapers will come, and who the reapers are He has explained, <q>And the reapers are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q>  We are but men, the reapers are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. We too indeed, if we finish our course, shall be equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but now when we chafe against the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, we are as yet but men. And we ought now to give ear to the words, <q>Wherefore let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall.</q>  For do ye think, my Brethren, that these tares we read of do not get up into this  seat?  Think ye that they are all below, and none above up here? God grant we may not be so. <q>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you.</q>  I tell you of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, my Beloved, even in these high seats there is both wheat, and tares, and among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> there is wheat, and tares. Let the good tolerate the bad; let the bad change themselves, and imitate the good. Let us all, if it may be so, attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; let us all through His mercy escape the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of this world. Let us seek after good days, for we are now in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> days; but in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> days let us not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>, that so we may be able to arrive at the good days.</p>
