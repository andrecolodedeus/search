<h1>Sermon 24</h1>

<p> <em>On the Feast of the Nativity, IV.</em></p>

<h2>I. The Incarnation fulfils all its types and promises</h2>

<p>The Divine goodness, dearly beloved, has indeed always taken thought for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> in various manners, and in many portions, and of His mercy has imparted many gifts of His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> to the ages of old; but in these last times has exceeded all the abundance of His usual kindness, when in Christ the very Mercy has descended to sinners, the very Truth to those that are astray, the very Life to those that are dead: so that Word, which is co-eternal and co-equal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, might take our <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> nature into union with His Godhead, and, being born God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, might also be born Man of man. This was indeed promised from the foundation of the world, and had always been prophesied by many intimations of facts and words : but how small a portion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> would these types and fore-shadowed <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> have saved, had not the coming of Christ fulfilled those long and secret promises: and had not that which then benefited but a few <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in the prospect, now benefited myriads of the faithful in its accomplishment. Now no longer then are we led to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> by signs and types, but being confirmed by the gospel story we worship that which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to have been done; the prophetic lore  assisting our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, so that we have no manner of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about that which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have been predicted by such sure oracles. For hence it is that the Lord says to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: <q>In your seed shall all nations be blessed <span class="stiki" id="note360766"><a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse18">Genesis&nbsp;22:18</a></span>:</q> hence David, in the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, sings, saying: <q>The Lord swore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to David, and He shall not frustrate it: of the fruit of your loins will I set upon your seat ;</q> hence the Lord again says through Isaiah: <q>behold a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive in her womb, and shall bear a Son, and His Name shall be called <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, which is interpreted, God with us <span class="stiki" id="note360768"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;7:14</a></span>,</q> and again, <q>a rod shall come forth from the root of Jesse, and a flower shall arise from his root. </q> In which rod, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the blessed Virgin Mary is predicted, who sprung from the stock of Jesse and David and fecundated by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, brought forth a new flower of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, becoming a virgin-mother.</p>

<h2>II. The Incarnation was the only effective remedy to the fall</h2>

<p>Let the righteous then <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and let the hearts of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> turn to God's praise, and the sons of men confess His wondrous acts; since in this work of God especially our <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> estate realizes how highly its Maker values it: in that, after His great gift to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> in making us after His image, He contributed far more largely to our restoration when the Lord Himself took on Him <q>the form of a slave.</q> For though all that the Creator expends upon His creature is part of one and the same Fatherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, yet it is less wonderful than man should advance to divine things than that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should descend to humanity. But unless the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> did deign to do this, no kind of righteousness, no form of wisdom could rescue any one from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> bondage and from the depths of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death. For the condemnation that passes with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from one upon all would remain, and our nature, corroded by its deadly wound, would discover no remedy, because it could not alter its state in its own strength. For the first man received the substance of flesh from the earth, and was quickened with a rational spirit by the in-breathing of his Creator , so that living after the image and likeness of his Maker, he might preserve the form of God's goodness and righteousness as in a bright mirror. And, if he had perseveringly maintained this high dignity of his nature by observing the Law that was given him, his uncorrupt mind would have raised the character even of his earthly body to heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But because in unhappy rashness he trusted the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> deceiver, and agreeing to his presumptuous counsels, preferred to forestall rather than to win the increase of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> that was in store for him, not only did that one man, but in him all that came after him also hear the verdict: <q>earth you are, and unto earth shall you go <span class="stiki" id="note360771"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;3:19</a></span>;</q> <q>as in the earthy,</q> therefore, <q>such are they also that are earthy <span class="stiki" id="note360772"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse48">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:48</a></span>,</q> and no one is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, because no one is heavenly.</p>

<h2>III. We all become partakers in the Birth of Christ, by the re-birth of baptism</h2>

<p>And so to undo this chain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death, the Almighty <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, that fills all things and contains all things, altogether equal to the Father and co-eternal in one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> from Him and with Him, took on Him man's nature, and the Creator and Lord of all things deigned to be a mortal: choosing for His mother one whom He had made, one who, without loss of her maiden <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, supplied so much of bodily substance, that without the pollution of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> seed the New Man might be possessed of purity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In Christ, therefore, born of the Virgin's womb, the nature does not differ from ours, because His nativity is wonderful. For He Who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man: and there is no lie in either nature. <q>The Word became flesh</q> by exaltation of the flesh, not by failure of the Godhead: which so tempered its power and goodness as to exalt our nature by taking it, and not to lose His own by imparting it. In this nativity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of David, <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> sprang out of the earth, and righteousness looked down from heaven. </q> In this nativity also, Isaiah's saying is fulfilled, <q>let the earth produce and bring forth <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and let righteousness spring up together <span class="stiki" id="note360774"><a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;45:8</a></span> .</q> For the earth of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, which in the first transgressor, was cursed, in this Offspring of the Blessed Virgin only produced a seed that was blessed and free from the fault of its stock. And each one is a partaker of this spiritual origin in regeneration; and to every one when he is re-born, the water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is like the Virgin's womb; for the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> fills the font, Who filled the Virgin, that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which that sacred conception overthrew, may be taken away by this mystical washing.</p>

<h2>IV. The Manich&aelig;ans, by rejecting the Incarnation, have fallen into terrible iniquities</h2>

<p>In this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, dear beloved, the mad <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> has no part, nor have they any partnership in the regeneration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who say that He was corporeally born of the Virgin Mary: so that, as they do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His real nativity, they do not accept His real passion either; and, not acknowledging Him really buried, they reject His genuine resurrection. For, having entered on the perilous path of their abominable dogma, where all is dark and slippery, they rush into the abyss of death over the precipice of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, and find no sure ground on which to rest; because, besides all their other diabolical enormities, on the very chief feast of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> worship, as their latest confession has made manifest , they revel in bodily as well as mental pollution, losing their own modesty as well as the purity of their Faith; so that they are found to be as filthy in their <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> as they are <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a> in their doctrines.</p>

<h2>V. Other heresies contain some portion of truth, but the Manich&aelig;ans contain none whatever</h2>

<p>Other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, dearly beloved, although they are all rightly to be condemned in their variety, yet have each in some part of them that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, in laying down that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is less than the Father and a creature, and in thinking that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was like all else made by the same (Father), has lost himself in great <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; but he has not denied the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and unchangeable Godhead in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, though he could not see it in the Unity of the Trinity. Macedonius was devoid of the light of the Truth when he did not receive the Godhead of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but he did acknowledge one power and the same nature in the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Sabellius was plunged into inextricable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by holding the unity of substance to be inseparable in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but granted to a singleness of nature what he should have attributed to an equality of nature , and because he could not understand a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Trinity, he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in one and the same person under a threefold appellation. Photinus, misled by his mental blindness, acknowledged in Christ <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man of our substance, but did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him born God of God before all ages, and so losing the entirety of the Faith, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to have taken on Him the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh in such a way as to assert that there was no <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in it, because the Godhead Itself took its place.  Thus, if all the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which the catholic Faith has <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> are recanted, something is found in one after another which can be separated from its damnable setting. But in the detestable dogma of the Manicheans there is absolutely nothing which can be adjudged tolerable in any degree.</p>

<h2>VI. Christians must cling to the one Faith and not be led astray</h2>

<p>But you, dearly beloved, whom I address in no less earnest terms than those of the blessed Apostle Peter, <q>a chosen race, a royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation, a people for God's own possession <span class="stiki" id="note360778"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:9</a></span>,</q> built upon the impregnable rock, Christ, and joined to the Lord our Saviour by His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> assumption of our flesh, remain firm in that Faith, which you have professed before many witnesses, and in which you were reborn through water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and received the anointing of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and the seal of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.  But <q>if any one preach to you any thing beside that which you have learned, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360780"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse9">Galatians&nbsp;1:9</a></span>:</q> refuse to put <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> fables before the clearest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and what you may happen to read or hear contrary to the rule of the catholic and Apostolic creed, judge it altogether deadly and diabolical. Be not carried away by their deceitful keepings of sham and pretended <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> which tend not to the cleansing, but to the destroying of men's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. They put on indeed a cloke of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, but under this deceit they conceal the filthiness of their acts, and from the recesses of their ungodly heart hurl shafts to wound the simple; that, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart. </q> A mighty bulwark is a sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to which nothing has to be added or taken away: because unless it is one, it is no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as the Apostle says, <q>one Lord, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in us all <span class="stiki" id="note360782"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;4:5-6</a></span> .</q> Cling to this unity, dearly beloved, with minds unshaken, and in it <q>follow after</q> all <q><a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360783"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;12:14</a></span>,</q> in it carry out the Lord's commands, because <q>without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is impossible to please God ,</q> and without it nothing is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, nothing is pure, nothing alive: <q>for the just lives by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ,</q> and he who by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> deception loses it, is dead though living, because as righteousness is gained by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so too by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life gained, as says our Lord and Saviour. And this is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom You have sent. <span class="stiki" id="note360786"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;17:3</a></span> May He make you to advance and persevere to the end, Who lives and reigns with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
