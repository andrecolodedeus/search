<h1>Sermon 24 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[LXXIV. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse52">Matthew 13:52</a> <em>, <q>Therefore every scribe who has been made a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> to the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>,</q> etc.</em></p>

<p>1. The lesson of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> reminds me to seek out, and to explain to you, Beloved, as the Lord shall give me power, who is that Scribe instructed in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, who is <q>like an householder bringing out of his treasure things new and old.</q>  For here the lesson ended. <q>What are the new and old things of an instructed Scribe?</q> Now it is well known who they were, whom the ancients, after the custom of our Scriptures, called <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a>, those, namely, who professed the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Law. For such were called <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> among the Jewish people, not such as are so called now in the service  of judges, or the custom of states. For we must not enter school to no purpose, but we must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what signification to take the words of Scripture; lest when anything is mentioned out of it, which is usually understood in another secular use of the term, the hearer mistake it, and by thinking of its customary meaning, understand not what he has heard. The <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> then were they who professed the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Law, and to them belonged both the keeping and the studying, as well as also the transcribing and the expounding, of the books of the Law.</p>

<p>2. Such were they whom <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> rebukes, because they have the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and <q>would neither enter in themselves, nor suffer others to enter in;</q>  in these words finding fault with the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a>, the teachers of the law of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Of whom in another place He says, <q>Whatsoever they say, do, but do not ye after their works, for they say and do not.</q>  Why is it said to you, <q>For they say and do not?</q> but that there are some of whom what the Apostle says, is clearly exemplified, <q>Thou that preachest a man should not steal, do you steal? Thou that sayest a man should not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, do you commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>? Thou that abhorrest <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, do you commit sacrilege? Thou that makest your boast of the Law, through breaking the Law do you dishonour God? For the name of God is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> through you.</q>  It is surely plain that the Lord speaks of these, <q>For they say and do not.</q> They then are <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a>, but not <q>instructed in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q></p>

<p>3. Peradventure some of you may say, <q>And how can a bad man speak what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, when it is written, in the words of the Lord Himself, 'A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> man out of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> treasure of his heart brings forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things. You hypocrites, how can you being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speak <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things?'</q>  In the one place He says, <q>How can you being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speak <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things?</q> in the other He says, <q>What they say, do, but do ye not after their works. For they say, and do not.</q> If <q>they say and do not,</q> they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; if they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, they cannot <q>speak <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things;</q> how then are we to do what we hear from them, when we cannot hear from them what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>? Now take heed, Holy and Beloved,  how this question may be solved. Whatever an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> man brings forth from himself, is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; whatever an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> man brings forth out of his own heart, is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; for there is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> treasure. But whatever a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man brings forth out of his heart, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; for there is the good treasure. Whence then did those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men bring forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things? <q>Because they sat in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> seat.</q>  Had He not first said, <q>They sit in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> seat;</q> He would never have enjoined that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men should be heard. For what they brought forth out of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> treasure of their own heart, was one thing; another what they gave utterance to out of the seat of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the criers so to say of the judge. What the crier says, will never be attributed to him if he speak in the presence of the judge. What the crier says in his own house is one thing, what the crier says as hearing it from the judge is another. For whether he will or no, the crier must proclaim the sentence  of punishment even of his own friend. And so whether he will or no, must he proclaim the sentence of the acquittal even of his own enemy. Suppose him to speak from his heart; he acquits his friend, and punishes his enemy. Suppose him to speak from the judge's chair; he punishes his friend, and acquits his enemy. So with the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a>; suppose them to speak out of their own heart; you will hear, <q>Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die.</q>  Suppose them to speak from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> seat; you will hear, <q>You shall not kill, You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, You shall not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">steal</a>, You shall not bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. Honour your father and mother; you shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself.</q>  Do then this which the official seat  proclaims by the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a>; not that which their heart utters. For so embracing both judgments of the Lord, you will not be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> in the one, and guilty of disobedience in the other; but wilt understand that both agree together, and wilt regard both that as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, <q>that a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> man out of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> treasure brings forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things;</q> and that other also, that those <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> did not speak <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things out of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> treasure of their heart, but that they were able to speak <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things out of the treasure of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> seat.</p>

<p>4. So then those words of the Lord will not disturb you, when He says, <q>Every tree is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by his own fruit. Do men gather grapes of thorns, and figs of thistles?</q>  The <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore were thorns and thistles, and notwithstanding, <q>what they say do, but do ye not after their works.</q> So then the grape is gathered from thorns, and the fig from thistles, as He has given you to understand according to the method I have just laid down. For so sometimes in the vineyard's thorny hedge, the vines get entangled, and clusters of grapes hang from the brambles. You had no sooner heard the name of thorns, than you were on the point of disregarding the grape. But seek for the root of the thorns, and you will see where to find it. Follow too the root of the hanging cluster, and you will see where to find it. So understand that the one refers to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee's</a> heart, the other to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> seat.</p>

<p>5. But why were they such as they were? <q>Because,</q> says St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>the veil is upon their heart. And they do not see that the old things are passed away, and all things have become new.</q>  Hence it is that they were such, and all others who even now are like them. Why are they old things? Because they have been a long while published. Why new? Because they relate to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. How the veil then is taken away, the Apostle himself tells us. <q>But when you shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.</q>  So then the Jew who does not turn to the Lord, does not carry on his mind's eye to the end. Just as at that time the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in this figure did not carry on the gaze of their eyes <q>to the end,</q>  that is, to the face of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. For the shining face of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> contained a figure of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; the veil was interposed because the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> could not yet behold the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of his countenance. <q>Which figure is done away.</q>  For so said the Apostle; <q>which is done away.</q> Why done away? Because when the emperor comes, the images of him are taken away. The image is looked upon, when the emperor is not present; but where he is, whose image it is, there the image is removed. There were then images borne before Him, before that our Emperor the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> came. When the images were taken away, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Emperor's presence is seen. Therefore, <q>When any one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</q> For the voice of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> sounded through the veil, but the face of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was not seen. And so now the voice of Christ sounds to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by the voice of the old Scriptures: they hear their voice, but they see not the face of Him that speaks. Would they then that the veil should be taken away? <q>Let them turn to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</q> For then the old things are not taken away, but laid up in a treasury, that the Scribe may henceforth be <q>instructed in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, bringing forth out of his treasure</q> not <q>new things</q> only, nor <q>old things</q> only. For if he bring forth <q>new things</q> only or <q>old things</q> only; he is not <q>a scribe instructed in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, bringing forth out of his treasure things new and old.</q> If he say and do them not; he brings forth from the official seat, not from the treasure of his heart. And (we speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, Holy Brethren) what things are brought out of the old, are illustrated by the new. Therefore do <q>we turn to the Lord, that the veil may be taken away.</q></p>
