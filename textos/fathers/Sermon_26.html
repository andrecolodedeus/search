<h1>Sermon 26</h1>

<p> <em>On the Feast of the Nativity, VI.</em></p>

<h2>I. Christmas morning is the most appropriate time for thoughts on the Nativity</h2>

<p>On all days and at all times, dearly beloved, does the birth of our Lord and Saviour from the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin-mother</a> occur to the thoughts of the faithful, who meditate on divine things, that the mind may be aroused to the acknowledgment of its Maker, and whether it be occupied in the groans of supplication, or in the shouting of praise, or in the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, may employ its spiritual insight on nothing more frequently and more trustingly than on the fact that God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, begotten of the co-eternal Father, was also born by a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> birth. But this Nativity which is to be adored in heaven and on earth is suggested to us by no day more than this when, with the early light still shedding its rays on nature , there is borne in upon our senses the brightness of this wondrous <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Gabriel's converse with the astonished Mary and her conception by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as wondrously promised as <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, seem to recur not only to the memory but to the very eyes. For today the Maker of the world was born of a Virgin's womb, and He, who made all natures, became Son of her, whom He created. Today the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> appeared clothed in flesh, and That which had never been visible to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> eyes began to be tangible to our hands as well. Today the shepherds learned from <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels'</a> voices that the Saviour was born in the substance of our flesh and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and today the form of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> message was pre-arranged by the leaders of the Lord's flocks , so that we too may say with the army of the heavenly host: <q>Glory in the highest to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and on earth peace to men of good will.</q></p>

<h2>II. Christians are essentially participators in the nativity of Christ</h2>

<p>Although, therefore, that infancy, which the majesty of God's Son did not disdain, reached mature manhood by the growth of years and, when the triumph of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> and resurrection was completed, all the actions of humility which were undertaken for us ceased, yet today's festival renews for us the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> childhood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> born of the Virgin Mary: and in adoring the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, we find we are celebrating the commencement of our own life. For the birth of Christ is the source of life for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> folk, and the birthday of the Head is the birthday of the body. Although every individual that is called has his own order, and all the sons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are separated from one another by intervals of time, yet as the entire body of the faithful being born in the font of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is crucified with Christ in His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, raised again in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, and placed at the Father's right hand in His ascension, so with Him are they born in this nativity. For any believer in whatever part of the world that is re-born in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, quits the old paths of his original nature  and passes into a new man by being re-born; and no longer is he reckoned of his earthly father's stock but among the seed of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, Who became the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> in order that we might have the power to be the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For unless He came down to us in this humiliation, no one would reach His presence by any merits of his own. Let not earthly wisdom shroud in darkness the hearts of the called on this point, and let not the frailty of earthly thoughts raise itself against the loftiness of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for it will soon return to the lowest dust. At the end of the ages is fulfilled that which was ordained from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>: and in the presence of realities, when signs and types have ceased, the Law and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> have become Truth: and so <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is found the father of all nations, and the promised blessing is given to the world in his seed: nor are they only <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> whom blood and flesh  begot, but the whole body of the adopted enter into possession of the heritage prepared for the sons of Faith. Be not disturbed by the cavils of silly questionings, and let not the effects of the Divine word be dissipated by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> calculation; we with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God and <q>waver not through unbelief <span class="stiki" id="note360791"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;4:20-21</a></span> </q> but <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> most assuredly that what the Lord promised, He is able to perform.</q></p>

<h2>III. Peace with God is His best gift to man</h2>

<p>The Saviour then, dearly beloved, is born not of fleshly seed but of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, in such wise that the condemnation of the first transgression did not touch Him. And hence the very greatness of the boon conferred demands of us reverence worthy of its splendour. For, as the blessed Apostle teaches, <q>we have received not the spirit of this world but the Spirit which is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things which are given us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360792"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:12</a></span>:</q> and that Spirit can in no other way be rightly worshipped, except by offering Him that which we received from Him. But in the treasures of the Lord's bounty what can we find so suitable to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the present feast as the peace, which at the Lord's nativity was first proclaimed by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>-<a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a>? For that it is which brings forth the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the nurse of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and the mother of unity: the rest of the blessed and our <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> home; whose proper work and special office it is to join to God those whom it removes from the world. Whence the Apostle incites us to this good end, in saying, <q>being justified therefore by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> let us have peace towards God <span class="stiki" id="note360793"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;5:1</a></span> .</q> In which brief sentence are summed up nearly all the commandments; for where <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> peace is, there can be no lack of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But what is it, dearly beloved, to have peace towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except to wish what He bids, and not to wish what He forbids? For if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> friendships seek out equality of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and similarity of desires, and difference of habits can never attain to full harmony, how will he be partaker of divine peace, who is pleased with what displeases God and desires to get delight from what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to be offensive to God? That is not the spirit of the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; such wisdom is not acceptable to the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the adopted. That chosen and royal race must live up to the dignity of its regeneration, must <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what the Father loves, and in nought disagree with its Maker, lest the Lord should again say: <q>I have begotten and raised up sons, but they have scorned Me: the ox <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his owner and the ass his master's crib: but <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me and My people has not acknowledged Me <span class="stiki" id="note360794"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;1:2-3</a></span> .</q></p>

<h2>IV. We must be worthy of our calling as sons and friends of God</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of this boon is great, dearly beloved, and this gift exceeds all gifts that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should call man son, and man should name God Father: for by these terms we perceive and learn the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which reached so great a height. For if in natural progeny and earthly <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> those who are born of noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> are lowered by the faults of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> intercourse, and unworthy offspring are put to shame by the very brilliance of their ancestry; to what end will they come who through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the world do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to be outcast from the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Christ? But if it gains the praise of men that the father's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> should shine again in their descendants, how much more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> is it for those who are born of God to regain the brightness of their Maker's likeness and display in themselves Him Who begot them, as says the Lord: <q>Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven <span class="stiki" id="note360795"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;5:16</a></span>?</q> We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> indeed, as the Apostle John says that <q>the whole world lies in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one <span class="stiki" id="note360796"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:19</a></span>,</q> and that by the stratagems of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> numberless attempts are made either to frighten man in his struggle upwards by adversity or to spoil him by prosperity, but <q>greater is He that is in us, than he that is against us ,</q> and they who have peace with God and are always saying to the Father with their whole hearts <q>your will be done <span class="stiki" id="note360798"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;6:10</a></span> </q> can be overcome in no battles, can be hurt by no assaults. For accusing ourselves in our confessions and refusing the spirit's consent to our fleshly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, we stir up against us the enmity of him who is the author of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but secure a peace with God that nothing can destroy, by accepting His gracious service, in order that we may not only surrender ourselves in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to our King but also be united to Him by our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>. For if we are like-minded, if we wish what He wishes, and disapprove what He disapproves, He will finish all our <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> for us, He Who gave the will, will also give the power: so that we may be fellow-workers in His works, and with the exultation of Faith may utter that prophetic song: <q>the Lord is my light and my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: whom shall I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? The Lord is the defender of my life: of whom shall I be afraid ?</q></p>

<h2>V. The birth of Christ is the birth of peace to the Church</h2>

<p>They then who <q>are born not of blood nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of man but of God <span class="stiki" id="note360800"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;1:13</a></span>,</q> must offer to the Father the unanimity of peace-loving sons, and all the members of adoption must meet in the First-begotten of the new creation, Who came to do not His own Will but His that sent Him; inasmuch as the Father in His gracious favour has adopted as His heirs not those that are discordant nor those that are unlike Him, but those that are in feeling and affection one. They that are re-modelled after one pattern must have a spirit like the model. The birthday of the Lord is the birthday of peace: for thus says the Apostle, <q>He is our peace, who made both one ;</q> since whether we be Jew or Gentile, <q>through Him we have access in one Spirit to the Father. </q> And it was this in particular that He taught His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> before the day of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> which He had of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> fore-ordained, saying, <q>My peace I give unto you, My peace I leave for you <span class="stiki" id="note360803"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;14:27</a></span>;</q> and lest under the general term the character of His peace should escape notice, He added, <q>not as the world give I unto you <span class="stiki" id="note360804"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse27">Ib</a></span> .</q> The world, He says, has its friendships, and brings many that are apart into loving harmony. There are also minds which are equal in <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>., and similarity of desires produces equality of affection. And if any are perchance to be found who are not pleased with what is mean and dishonourable, and who exclude from the terms of their connection unlawful compacts, yet even such if they be either <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> , belong not to God's friendship but to this world's peace. But the peace of the spiritual and of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> coming down from above and leading upwards refuses to hold communion with the lovers of the world, resists all obstacles and flies from pernicious pleasures to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> joys, as the Lord says: <q>Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also <span class="stiki" id="note360806"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;6:21</a></span>:</q> that is, if what you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is below you will descend to the lowest depth: if what you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is above, you will reach the topmost height: there may the Spirit of peace lead and bring us, whose wishes and feeling are at one, and who are of one mind in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope and in charity: since <q>as many as are led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> these are sons of God <span class="stiki" id="note360807"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;8:14</a></span> </q> Who reigns with the Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
