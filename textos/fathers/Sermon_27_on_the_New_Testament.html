<h1>Sermon 27 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[LXXVII. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse21">Matthew 15:21</a> <em>,<q>Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the parts of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Sidon. And behold, a Canaanitish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q> etc.</em></p>

<p>1. This <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of Canaan, who has just now been brought before us in the lesson of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, shows us an example of humility, and the way of godliness; shows us how to rise from humility unto exaltation. Now she was, as it appears, not of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, of whom came the Patriarchs, and Prophets, and the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> according to the flesh; of whom the Virgin Mary herself was, who was the Mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> then was not of this people; but of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For, as we have heard, the Lord <q>departed into the coasts of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Sidon, and behold, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of Canaan came out of the same coasts,</q>  and with the greatest earnestness begged of Him the mercy to heal her daughter, <q>who was grievously vexed with a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Sidon were not cities of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; though they bordered on that people. So then, as being eager to obtain mercy she cried out, and boldly knocked; and He made as though He heard her not,  not to the end that mercy might be refused her, but that her desire might be enkindled; and not only that her desire might be enkindled, but that, as I have said before, her humility might be set forth. Therefore did she cry, while the Lord was as though He heard her not, but was ordering in silence what He was about to do. The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> besought the Lord for her, and said, <q>Send her away; for she cries after us.</q> And He said, <q>I am not sent, but unto the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> </p>

<p>2. Here arises a question out of these words; <q>If He was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, how came we from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> into Christ's fold? What is the meaning of the so deep economy  of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, that whereas the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the purpose of His coming&mdash; that He might have a Church in all nations, He said that 'He was not sent, but unto the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>'?</q> We understand then by this that it behooved Him to manifest His Bodily presence, His Birth, the exhibition of His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and the power of His Resurrection, among that people: that so it had been ordained, so set forth from the beginning, so predicted, and so fulfilled; that Christ Jesus was to come to the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, to be seen and slain, and to gain from among them those whom He foreknew. For that people was not wholly condemned, but sifted. There was among them a great quantity of chaff, but there was also the hidden worth  of the grain; there was among them that which was to be burnt, there was among them also that wherewith the barn was to be filled. For whence came the Apostles? Whence came Peter? Whence the rest?</p>

<p>3. Whence was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself, who was first called Saul? That is, first <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>? For when he was Saul, his name was derived from Saul: now Saul was a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> king; and in his reign he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> David.  So when he who was afterwards <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>,  was Saul, he was <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, at that time a persecutor of the innocent, at that time a waster of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For he had received letters from the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (burning as he was with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name), that he might show up whatever <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> he should find, to be punished.  While he is on his way, while he is breathing out slaughter, while he is thirsting for blood, he is thrown to the ground by the voice of Christ from heaven the persecutor, he is raised up the preacher. In him was fulfilled that which is written in the Prophet, <q>I will wound and I will heal.</q>  For that only in man does God wound, which lifts itself up against God. He is no unkind  physician who opens the swelling, who cuts, or cauterizes the corrupted part. He gives pain, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but he only gives pain, that he may bring the patient on to health. He gives pain; but if he did not, he would do no good. Christ then by one word laid Saul low, and raised up <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; that is, He laid low the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and raised up the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>. For what was the reason of his change of name, that whereas he was afore called Saul, he chose afterwards to be called <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; but that he acknowledged in himself that the name of Saul when he was a persecutor, had been a name of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>? He chose therefore a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> name; to be called <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, that is, the least. For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is, <q>the least.</q> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is nothing else but little. And now glorying in this name, and giving us a lesson  of humility, he says, <q>I am the least of the Apostles.</q>  Whence then, whence was he, but of the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? Of them were the other Apostles, of them was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, of them were they whom the same <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> mentions, as having seen the Lord after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. For he says, <q>That He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.</q> </p>

<p>4. Of this people too, of the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, were they, who when Peter was speaking, setting forth the Passion, and Resurrection, and Divinity of Christ (after that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> had been received, when all they on whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> had come, spoke with the tongues of all nations), being pricked in spirit as they heard him, sought counsel for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, understanding as they did that they were guilty of the Blood of Christ; because they had crucified, and slain Him, in whose name though slain by them they saw such great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought; and saw the presence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And so seeking counsel they received for answer; <q>Repent, and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> every one of you, in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shall be forgiven you.</q>  Who should despair of the forgiveness of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, when the crime of killing Christ was forgiven to those who were guilty of it? They were converted from among this people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; were converted, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. They came to the Lord's table, and in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> drank that Blood, which in their fury they had shed. Now in what sort they were converted, how decidedly,  and how perfectly, the Acts of the Apostles show. <q>For they sold all that they possessed, and laid the prices of their things at the Apostles' feet; and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need; and no man said that ought was his own, but they had all things common.</q>  And, <q>They were,</q> as it is written, <q>of one heart and of one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> Lo here are the sheep of whom He said, <q>I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> For to them He exhibited His Presence, for them in the midst of their <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> against Him He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> as He was being crucified, <q>Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do.</q>  The Physician understood how those frenzied men were in their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> putting the Physician to death, and in putting their Physician to death, though they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not, were preparing a medicine for themselves. For by the Lord so <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> are all we cured, by His Blood redeemed, by the Bread of His Body delivered from famine. This Presence then did Christ exhibit to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And so He said, <q>I am not sent, but unto the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>;</q> that to them He might exhibit the Presence of His body; not that He might disregard, and pass over the sheep which He had among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</p>

<p>5. For to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> He went not Himself, but sent His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And in this was fulfilled what the Prophet said; <q>A people whom I have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> has served Me.</q> See how deep, how clear, how express the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is; <q>a people whom I have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>,</q> that is, to whom I have not exhibited My Presence, <q>has served Me.</q> How? It goes on to say, <q>By the hearing of the ear they have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> Me:</q>  that is, they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, not by seeing, but by hearing. Therefore have the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> the greater praise. For the others saw and slew Him; the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> heard and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Now it was to call and gather together the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that that might be fulfilled which we have just now chanted, <q>Gather us from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that we may confess to Your Name, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in Your praise,</q>  that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> was sent. He, the least, made great, not by himself, but by Him whom he once <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, was sent to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,  from a robber become a shepherd, from a wolf a sheep. He, the least Apostle, was sent to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and laboured much among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and through him the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. His Epistles are the witnesses.</p>

<p>6. Of this you have a very sacred figure in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> also. A daughter of a ruler of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> was really dead, and her father besought the Lord, that He would go to her; he had left her sick, and in extreme danger.  The Lord set out to visit and heal the sick; in the mean time it was announced that she was dead, and it was told the father; <q>Your daughter is dead, trouble not the Master.</q> But the Lord who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He could raise the dead, did not deprive the despairing father of hope, and said to him, <q>Fear not: only <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> So he set out to the maiden; and in the way a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who had suffered from an issue of blood, and in her lengthened illness had spent to no purpose all that she had upon physicians, pressed herself in, how she could, among the crowds. When she touched the border of His garment, she was made whole. And the Lord said, <q>Who touched Me?</q> The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what had taken place, and saw that He was thronged by the multitudes, and that He was troubling Himself about one single <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who had touched Him gently, answered in astonishment, The multitudes press You, and sayest Thou, Who touched Me? And He said, Somebody has touched Me? For the other press, she has touched. The many  then rudely  press the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, few touch it healthfully. <q>Somebody,</q> says He, <q>has touched Me, for I perceive that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is gone out of Me. And when the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> saw that she was not hid, she fell down at His feet,</q> and confessed what had taken place. After this He set out again, and arrived whither He was going, and raised to life the young daughter of the ruler of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> who was found to be dead.</p>

<p>7. This was a literal fact, and was fulfilled as it is related; but nevertheless these very things which were done by the Lord had some further signification, being (if we may so say) a sort of visible and significative words. And this is especially plain, in that place where He sought fruit on the tree out of season, and because He found none, dried up the tree by His curse.  Unless this action be regarded as a figure, there is no good meaning in it; first to have sought fruit on that tree when it was not the season for fruit on any tree; and then even if it were now the time of fruit, what fault in the tree was it to have none? But because it signified, that He seeks not for leaves only, but for fruit also, that is, not for the words only, but for the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, by drying up that tree whereon he found only leaves, he signified their punishment who can speak <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, but will not do them. And so it is in this place also. For surely there is a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> in it. He who foreknows all things says, <q>Who touched Me?</q> The Creator makes Himself like one who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>; and He asks, who not only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this, but who even foreknew all other things. Doubtless there is something which Christ would speak to us in this significant <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>.</p>

<p>8. That daughter of the ruler of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> was a figure of the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, for whose sake Christ had come, who said, <q>I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> But the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who suffered from the issue of blood, figured the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, to which Christ was not sent in His bodily presence. He was going to the former, He was intent on her recovery; meanwhile the latter runs to meet Him, touches His border as though He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not; that is, she is healed by Him who is in some sense absent. He says, <q>Who touched Me?</q> as though He would say; I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this people; <q>A people whom I have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> has served Me. Some one has touched Me. For I perceive that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is gone out of Me;</q> that is, that My <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> has gone out and filled the whole world. Now it is the border that is touched, a small and outside  part of the garment.  Consider the Apostles as it were the garment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Among them <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was the border; that is, the last and least. For he said of himself that he was both; <q>I am the least of the Apostles.</q>  For he was called after them all, he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> after them all, he healed more than they all. The Lord was not sent but <q>unto the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> But because a <q>people whom He had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, was also to serve Him, and to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him in the hearing of the ear,</q> He made mention of them too when He was among the others. For the same Lord said in a certain place, <q>Other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, that there may be one fold and one shepherd.</q> </p>

<p>9. Of these was this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; therefore she was not refused, but only put off. <q>I am not sent,</q> says He, <q>but unto the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> And she was instant in her cries: she persevered, she knocked, as if she had already heard, <q>Ask, and receive; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</q> She kept on, she knocked. For so the Lord when He spoke these words, <q>Ask, and you shall receive; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you;</q>  had also said before, <q>Give not that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you;</q>  that is, lest after despising your pearls, they should even ill use you.  Cast not therefore before them what they despise.</p>

<p>10. And how distinguish we (as might be answered) who are <q>swine,</q> and who are <q>dogs</q>? This has been shown in the case of this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. For He only answered to her entreaties, <q>It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</q>  You are a dog, you are one of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, you worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. But for dogs what is so proper  as to lick stones? <q>It is not</q> therefore <q>meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</q> Had she retired after these words, she had gone away as she had come, a dog; but by knocking she was made of a dog one of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> kind.  For she persevered in asking, and from that reproach as it were she manifested her humility, and obtained mercy. For she was not excited, nor incensed, because she was called a dog, as she asked the blessing, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for mercy, but she said, <q>Truth, Lord;</q>  <q>You have called me a dog, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a dog I am, I acknowledge my name: it is the Truth that speaks: but I ought not on that account to be refused this blessing. Verily I am a dog; 'yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.' It is but a moderate and a small blessing I desire; I do not press to the table, I only seek for the crumbs.</q></p>

<p>11. See, Brethren, how the value of humility is set before us! The Lord had called her a dog; and she did not say, <q>I am not,</q> but she said, <q>I am.</q> And because she acknowledged herself to be a dog, immediately the Lord said, <q>Woman, great is your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; be it unto you even as you have asked.</q>  You have acknowledged yourself to be a dog, I now acknowledge you to be of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> kind. <q>O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, great is your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;</q> you have asked, and sought, and knocked; receive, find, be it opened unto you. See, Brethren, how in this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was a Canaanite, that is, who came from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and was a type, that is a figure, of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of humility has been eminently set before us. For the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation, to the end that it might be deprived of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, was puffed up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, because to them it had been vouchsafed  to receive the Law, because out of this nation the Patriarchs had proceeded, the Prophets had sprung, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, had done the great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> which we have heard of in the Psalm,  had led the people through the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, when the waters retired, and had received the Law, which he gave to this people. This was that whereupon the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation was lifted up, and through this very <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> it happened that they were not willing to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> themselves to Christ the author of humility, and the restrainer of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> swelling, to God the Physician, who, being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> became Man, that man might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> himself to be but man. O mighty remedy! If this remedy cure not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what can cure it. He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is made Man; He lays aside His Divinity, that is, in a manner sequestrates,  hides, that is, what was His Own, and appears only in that He had taken to Him. Being God He is made man: and man will not acknowledge himself to be man, that is, will not acknowledge himself to be mortal, will not acknowledge himself to be frail, will not acknowledge himself to be a sinner, will not acknowledge himself to be sick, that so at least as sick he may seek the physician; but what is more perilous still, he fancies himself in sound health.</p>

<p>12. So then for this reason that people did not come to Him, that is by reason of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; and the natural branches are said to be broken off from the olive tree, that is from that people founded  by the Patriarchs; in other words, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are for their punishment <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> barren through the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; and the wild olive is grafted into that olive tree. The wild olive tree is the people of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. So says the Apostle, <q>that the wild olive tree is grafted into the good olive tree, but the natural branches are broken off.</q>  Because of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> they were broken off: and the wild olive tree grafted in because of humility. This humility did the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> show forth when she said, <q>Truth, Lord,</q> <q>I am a dog, I desire only the crumbs.</q> In this humility also did the Centurion please Him; who when he desired that his servant might be healed by the Lord, and the Lord said, <q>I will come and heal him,</q> answered, <q>Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof, but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. I am not worthy that You should come under my roof.</q>  He did not receive Him into his house, but he had received Him already in his heart. The more <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, the more capacious, and the more full. For the hills drive back the water, but the valleys are filled by it. And what then, what said the Lord to those who followed Him after that he had said, <q>I am not worthy that You should come under my roof</q>? <q>Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, no, not in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>;</q> that is, in that people to whom I came, <q>I have not found so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> And whence great? Great from being the least, that is, great from humility. <q>I have not found so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;</q> like a grain of mustard seed, which by how much smaller it is, by so much the more burning is it. Therefore did the Lord at once graft the wild olive into the good olive tree. He did it then when He said, <q>Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, no, not in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q></p>

<p>13. Lastly, mark what follows. <q>Therefore,</q>&mdash; that is, because <q>I have not found so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,</q> that is, so great humility with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash;<q>Therefore I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Isaac and Jacob in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q>  <q>Shall sit,</q> that is, <q>shall rest.</q> For we must not form notions of carnal banquets there, or desire any such thing in that kingdom, as to change not <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but only to make an exchange of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. For it is one thing to desire the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> for the sake of wisdom and life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; another, for the sake of earthly felicity, as though there we should have it in more abundant and greater measure. If you think to be rich in that kingdom, you do not cut off, but only changest desire; and yet rich you will really be, and in none other place but there will you be rich; for here your want gathers together the abundance of things. Why have rich men much? Because they want much. A greater want heaps together as it were greater means; there want itself shall die. Then you shall be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> rich, when you shall be in want of nothing. For now you are not surely rich, and an Angel poor, who has not horses, and carriages, and servants. Why? Because he does not want any of these: because in proportion to his greater strength, is his want the less. Therefore there there are riches, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> riches. Figure not to yourselves then banquets of this earth in that place. For the banquets of this world are daily medicines; they are necessary for a kind of sickness we have, wherewith we are born. This sickness every one is sensible of, when the hour for refreshment is passed. Would you see how great a sickness this is, that as an acute fever would be fatal in seven days? Do not fancy yourself then to be in health. Immortality will be health. For this present is only one long sickness. Because you support your disease by daily medicines; you fancy yourself in health; take away the medicines, and then see what you can do.</p>

<p>14. For from the moment we are born, we must needs be dying. This disease must needs bring us to death. This indeed physicians say when they examine their patients. For instance, <q>This man has the dropsy, he is dying; this disease cannot be cured. This man has the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>:  this disease too cannot be cured. He is in a consumption. Who can cure this? He must needs die, he must perish.</q> See, the physician has now pronounced that he is in a consumption; that he cannot but die; and yet sometimes the dropsical patient does not die of his disease, and the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprous</a> does not die of his, nor the consumptive patient of his; but now it is absolutely necessary that every one who is born should die of this. He dies of it, he cannot do otherwise. This the physician and the unskilled both pronounce upon; and though he die somewhat more slowly, does he on that account not die? Where then is there <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> health, except where there is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>? But if it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and no corruption, no wasting, what need will there be there of nourishment? Therefore, when you hear it said, <q>They shall sit down with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and Jacob;</q>  get not your body, but your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in order. There shall you be filled; and this inner  man has its proper food. In relation to it is it said, <q>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.</q>  And so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> filled shall they be that they shall hunger no more.</p>

<p>15. Therefore did the Lord graft in at once the wild olive tree, when He said, <q>Many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>;</q> that is, they shall be grafted into the good olive tree. For <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, are the roots of this olive tree; <q>but the children of the kingdom,</q> that is, the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>shall go away into outer darkness.</q> The <q>natural branches shall be broken off,</q> that the <q>wild olive tree may be grafted in.</q> Now why did the natural branches deserve to be cut off, except for <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>? Why the wild olive tree to be grafted in, except for humility? Whence also that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said, <q>Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</q>  And thereupon she hears, <q>O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, great is your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q>  And so again that centurion, <q>I am not worthy that You should come under my roof.</q>  <q>Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, no, not in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q>  Let us then learn, or let us hold fast, humility. If we have it not yet, let us learn it; if we have it, let us not lose it. If we have it not yet, let us have it, that we may be grafted in; if we have it already, let us hold it fast, that we may not be cut off.</p>
