<h1>Sermon 28</h1>

<p> <em>On the Festival of the Nativity, VIII.</em></p>

<h2>I. The Incarnation an unceasing source of joy</h2>

<p>Though all the divine utterances exhort us, dearly beloved, to <q><a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the Lord always <span class="stiki" id="note360829"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse4">Philippians&nbsp;4:4</a></span>,</q> yet today we are no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> incited to a full spiritual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Lord's nativity is shining brightly upon us , so that we may have recourse to that unutterable condescension of the Divine Mercy, whereby the Creator of men deigned to become man, and be found ourselves in His nature whom we worship in ours. For God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the only-begotten of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and not-begotten Father, remaining <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <q>in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and unchangeably and without time  possessing the property of being no way different to the Father He received <q>the form of a slave</q> without loss of His own majesty, that He might advance us to His state and not lower Himself to ours. Hence both natures abiding in possession of their own properties such unity is the result of the union that whatever of Godhead is there is inseparable from the manhood: and whatever of manhood, is indivisible from the Godhead.</p>

<h2>II. The Virgin's conception explained</h2>

<p>In celebrating therefore the birthday of our Lord and Saviour, dearly beloved, let us entertain pure thoughts of the blessed Virgin's child-bearing, so as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that at no moment of time was the power of the Word wanting to the flesh and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which she conceived, and that the temple of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body did not previously receive its form and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that its Inhabitant might come and take possession but through Himself and in Himself was the beginning given to the New Man, so that in the one <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and Man there might be Godhead without a mother, and Manhood without a Father. For her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> fecundated by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> at one and the same time brought forth without trace of corruption both the offspring and the Maker of her race. Hence also the same Lord, as the Evangelist relates, asked of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> whose son they had learned Christ to be on the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and when they replied that the tradition was He would come of David's seed, <q>How,</q> says He, <q>does David in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> call Him Lord, saying, the Lord said to my Lord: sit on My right hand till I place your enemies as the footstool of your feet ?</q> And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> could not solve the question put, because they did not understand that in the one Christ both the stock of David and the Divine nature were there prophesied.</p>

<h2>III. In redeeming man, justice as well as mercy had to be considered</h2>

<p>But the majesty of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in which He is equal with the Father in its garb of a slave's humility feared no diminution, required no augmentation: and the very effect of His mercy which He expended on the restitution of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He was able to bring about solely by the power of His Godhead; so as to rescue the creature that was made in the image of God from the yoke of his cruel oppressor. But because the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> had not shown himself so violent in his attack on the first man as to bring him over to his side without the consent of His <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, man's <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and hostile desires had to be destroyed in such wise that the standard of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> should not stand in the way of the gift of Grace. And therefore in the general ruin of the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> there was but one remedy in the secret of the Divine plan which could succour the fallen, and that was that one of the sons of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> should be born free and innocent of original transgression, to prevail for the rest both by His example and His merits. Still further, because this was not permitted by natural generation, and because there could be no offspring from our faulty stock without seed, of which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>Who can make a clean thing conceived of an unclean seed? Is it not  You who is  alone <span class="stiki" id="note360833"><a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse4">Job&nbsp;14:4</a></span>?</q> David's Lord was made David's Son, and from the fruit of the promised branch  sprang One without fault, the twofold <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> joining together into one Person, that by one and the same conception and birth might spring <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, in Whom was present both <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead for the performance of mighty works and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Manhood for the endurance of sufferings.</p>

<h2>IV. All heresies proceed from failure to believe the twofold nature of Christ</h2>

<p>The catholic Faith then, dearly beloved, may scorn the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> that bark against it, who, deceived by the vanity of worldly wisdom, have forsaken the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Truth, and being unable to understand the Incarnation of the Word, have constructed for themselves out of the source of enlightenment occasion of blindness. For after investigating almost all false <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers'</a> opinions, even those which presume to deny the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, we come to the conclusion that hardly any one has gone astray, unless he has refused to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the reality of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> in Christ under the confession of one Person. For some have ascribed to the Lord only manhood , others only Deity.  Some have said that, though there was in Him <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead, His flesh was unreal.  Others have acknowledged that He took <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> flesh but say that He had not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father; and by assigning to His Godhead what belonged to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> substance, have made for themselves a greater and a lesser <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although there can be in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead no grades: seeing that whatever is less than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is not God.  Others recognizing that there is no difference between Father and Son, because they could not understand unity of Godhead except in unity of Person, have maintained that the Father is the same as the Son : so that to be born and nursed, to suffer and die, to be buried and rise again, belonged to the same Father who sustained throughout the Person of both Man and the Word. Certain have thought that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> had a body not of our substance but assumed from higher and subtler elements : whereas certain others have considered that in the flesh of Christ there was no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but that the Godhead of the Word Itself fulfilled the part of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.  But their unwise assertion passes into this form that, though they acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, yet they say it was devoid of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, because the Godhead of Itself was sufficient for all purposes of reason to the Man as well as to the God in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Lastly the same people have dared to assert that a certain portion of the Word was turned into Flesh, so that in the manifold varieties of this one dogma, not only the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the flesh and of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but also the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Word Itself is dissolved.</p>

<h2>V. Nestorianism and Eutychianism are particularly to be avoided at the present time</h2>

<p>There are many other astounding falsehoods also which we must not weary your ears, beloved, with enumerating. But after all these various impieties, which are closely connected by the relationship that exists between one form of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and another, we call your devout attention to the avoiding of these two <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> in particular: one of which, with <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> for its author, some time ago attempted to gain ground, but ineffectually; the other, which is equally damnable, has more recently sprung up with Eutyches as its propounder. The former dared to maintain that the blessed Virgin Mary was the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> manhood only, so that in her conception and childbearing no union might be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have taken place of the Word and the Flesh: because the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did not Himself become <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, but of His mere condescension linked Himself with created man. This can in no way be tolerated by catholic ears, which are so imbued with the gospel of Truth that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of a surety there is no hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> unless He were Himself the Son of the Virgin who was His mother's Creator. On the other hand this <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> propounder of more recent profanity has confessed the union of the two Natures in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but has maintained that the effect of this very union is that of the two one remained while the substance of the other no longer <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, which of course could not have been brought to an end except by either destruction or separation.  But this is so opposed to sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that it cannot be entertained without loss of one's <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name. For if the Incarnation of the Word is the uniting of the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> natures, but by the very fact of their coming together that which was twofold became single, it was only the Godhead that was born of the Virgin's womb, and went through the deceptive appearance of receiving nourishment and bodily growth: and to pass over all the changes of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> state, it was only the Godhead that was crucified, dead, and buried: so that according to those who thus think, there is no reason to hope for the resurrection, and Christ is not <q>the first-begotten from the dead <span class="stiki" id="note360843"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse18">Colossians&nbsp;1:18</a></span>;</q> because He was not One who ought to have been raised again, if He had not been One who could be slain.</p>

<h2>VI. The Deity and the Manhood were present in Christ from the very first</h2>

<p>Keep far from your hearts, dearly beloved, the poisonous lies of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> inspirations, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Godhead of the Son underwent no growth while with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, be wise and consider that to the same nature to which it was said in Adam, <q>You are earth, and unto earth shall you go <span class="stiki" id="note360844"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;3:19</a></span>,</q> it is said in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>sit on My right hand. </q> According to that Nature, whereby Christ is equal to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the Only-begotten was never inferior to the sublimity of the Father; nor was the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which He had with the Father a temporal possession; for He is on the very right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of which it is said in Exodus, <q>Your right hand, O Lord, is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in power <span class="stiki" id="note360846"><a href="../bible/exo016.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;16:6</a></span>;</q> and in Isaiah, <q>Lord, who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> our report? And the arm of the Lord, to whom is it revealed <span class="stiki" id="note360847"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;53:1</a></span>?</q> The man, therefore, assumed into the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, was in such wise received into the unity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Person from His very commencement in the body, that without the Godhead He was not conceived, without the Godhead He was not brought forth, without the Godhead He was not nursed. It was the same Person in the wondrous acts, and in the endurance of insults; through His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness crucified, dead and buried: through His Divine power, being raised the third day, He ascended to the heavens, sat down at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and in His nature as man received from the Father that which in His nature as God He Himself also gave. </p>

<h2>VII. The fullness of the Godhead is imparted to the Body (the Church) through the Head, (Christ)</h2>

<p>Meditate, dearly beloved on these things with devout hearts, and be always mindful of the apostle's injunction, who admonishes all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, saying, <q>See lest any one deceive you through <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain deceit according to the tradition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and not according to Christ; for in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and you have been filled in Him <span class="stiki" id="note360849"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse8">Colossians&nbsp;2:8-10</a></span> .</q> He said not <q>spiritually</q> but <q>bodily,</q> that we may understand the substance of flesh to be real, where there is the dwelling in the body of the fullness of the Godhead: wherewith, of course, the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is also filled, which, clinging to the Head, is the body of Christ; who lives and reigns with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, God for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
