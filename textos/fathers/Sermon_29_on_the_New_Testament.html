<h1>Sermon 29 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[LXXIX. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>Again on the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/mat017.htm">Matthew 17</a> <em>., where Jesus showed Himself on the mount to His three <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</em></p>

<p>1. We heard when the Holy <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was being read of the great vision on the mount, in which Jesus showed Himself to the three <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, Peter, James, and John. <q>His face did shine as the sun:</q> this is a figure of the shining of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. <q>His raiment was white as the snow:</q>  this is a figure of the purity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to which it was said by the Prophet, <q>Though your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be as scarlet, I will make them white as snow.</q>  Elias and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> were talking with Him; because the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> receives <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> from the Law and the Prophets. The Law is represented in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the Prophets in Elias; to speak briefly. For there are the mercies of God vouchsafed through a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Martyr to be rehearsed. Let us give ear. Peter desired three tabernacles to be made, one for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, one for Elias, and one for Christ. The solitude of the mountain had charms for him; he had been wearied with the tumult of the world's business. But why sought he three tabernacles, but because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not as yet the unity of the Law, and of Prophecy, and of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>? Lastly, he was corrected by the cloud, <q>While he yet spoke, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them.</q> Lo, the cloud has made one tabernacle; wherefore did you seek for three? <q>And a voice came out of the cloud, This is My beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased, hear ye Him.</q>  Elias speaks; but <q>hear Him;</q> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> speaks; but <q>hear Him.</q> The Prophets speak, the Law speaks; but <q>hear Him.</q> who is the voice of the Law, and the tongue of the Prophets. He spoke in them, and when He vouchsafed so to do, He appeared in His own person. <q>Hear ye Him:</q> let us then hear Him. When the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> spoke, think it was the cloud: from thence has the voice sounded out to us. Let us hear Him; that is, let us do what He says, let us hope for what He has promised.</p>
