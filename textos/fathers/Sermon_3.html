<h1>Sermon 3</h1>

<p> <em>On His Birthday, III: Delivered on the Anniversary of his Elevation to the Pontificate.</em></p>

<h2>I. The honour of being raised to the episcopate must be referred solely to the Divine Head of the Church</h2>

<p>As often as God's mercy deigns to bring round the day of His gifts to us, there is, dearly-beloved, just and reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for rejoicing, if only our appointment to the office be referred to the praise of Him who gave it. For though this recognition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may well be found in all His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, yet I take it to be peculiarly binding on me, who, regarding my own utter insignificance and the greatness of the office undertaken, ought myself also to utter that exclamation of the Prophet, <q>Lord, I heard Your speech and was afraid: I considered Your works and was dismayed. </q> For what is so unwonted and so dismaying as labour to the frail, exaltation to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, dignity to the undeserving? And yet we do not despair nor lose heart, because we put our trust not in ourselves but in Him who works in us. And hence also we have sung with harmonious voice the psalm of David, dearly beloved, not in our own praise, but to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Christ the Lord. For it is He of whom it is <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> written, <q>You are a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever after the order of Melchizedeck ,</q> that is, not after the order of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> descending along his own line of offspring was a temporal ministry, and ceased with the law of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, but after the order of Melchizedeck, in whom was prefigured the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> High Priest. And no reference is made to his parentage because in him it is understood that He was portrayed, whose generation cannot be declared. And finally, now that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of this Divine <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> has descended to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> agency, it runs not by the line of birth, nor is that which flesh and blood created, chosen, but without regard to the privilege of paternity and succession by inheritance, those men are received by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as its rulers whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> prepares: so that in the people of God's adoption, the whole body of which is <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> and royal, it is not the prerogative of earthly origin which obtains the unction , but the condescension of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> which creates the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<h2> 2. From Christ and through St. Peter the priesthood is handed on in perpetuity</h2>

<p>Although, therefore, dearly beloved, we be found both weak and <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> in fulfilling the duties of our office, because, whatever devoted and vigorous action we desire to do, we are hindered by the frailty of our very condition; yet having the unceasing propitiation of the Almighty and perpetual Priest, who being like us and yet equal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, brought down His Godhead even to things <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and raised His Manhood even to things Divine, we worthily and piously <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over His dispensation, whereby, though He has delegated the care of His sheep to many shepherds, yet He has not Himself abandoned the guardianship of His beloved flock. And from His overruling and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> protection we have received the support of the Apostles' aid also, which assuredly does not cease from its operation: and the strength of the foundation, on which the whole superstructure of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is reared, is not weakened  by the weight of the temple that rests upon it. For the solidity of that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was praised in the chief of the Apostles is perpetual: and as that remains which Peter <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so that remains which Christ instituted in Peter. For when, as has been read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> lesson , the Lord had asked the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> whom they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Him to be amid the various opinions that were held, and the blessed Peter had replied, saying, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> the Lord says, <q>Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona, because flesh and flood has not revealed it to you, but My Father, which is in heaven. And I say to you, that you are Peter, and upon this rock will I build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto you the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. And whatsoever you shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose on earth, shall be loosed also in heaven <span class="stiki" id="note360666"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;16:16-19</a></span> .</q></p>

<h2>III. St. Peter's work is still carried out by his successors</h2>

<p>The dispensation of Truth therefore abides, and the blessed Peter persevering in the strength of the Rock, which he has received, has not abandoned the helm of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which he undertook. For he was ordained before the rest in such a way that from his being called the Rock, from his being pronounced the Foundation, from his being constituted the Doorkeeper of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, from his being set as the Umpire to bind and to loose, whose judgments shall retain their validity in heaven, from all these mystical titles we might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of his association with Christ. And still today he more fully and effectually performs what is entrusted to him, and carries out every part of his duty and charge in Him and with Him, through Whom he has been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. And so if anything is rightly done and rightly decreed by us, if anything is won from the mercy of God by our daily supplications, it is of his work and merits whose power lives and whose authority prevails in his See. For this, dearly-beloved, was gained by that confession, which, inspired in the Apostle's heart by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, transcended all the uncertainty of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> opinions, and was endued with the firmness of a rock, which no assaults could shake. For throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Peter daily says, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and every tongue which confesses the Lord, accepts the instruction his voice conveys. This Faith conquers the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and breaks the bonds of his prisoners. It uproots us from this earth and plants us in heaven, and the gates of Hades cannot prevail against it. For with such solidity is it endued by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that the depravity of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> cannot mar it nor the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> overcome it.</p>

<h2>IV. This festival then is in St. Peter's honour, and the progress of his flock redounds to his glory</h2>

<p>And so, dearly beloved, with reasonable <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> we celebrate today's festival by such methods, that in my <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> person he may be recognized and honoured, in whom abides the care of all the shepherds, together with the charge of the sheep commended to him, and whose dignity is not abated even in so unworthy an heir. And hence the presence of my venerable brothers and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, so much desired and valued by me, will be the more sacred and precious, if they will transfer the chief <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of this service in which they have deigned to take part to him whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be not only the patron of this see, but also the primate of all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. When therefore we utter our exhortations in your ears, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he is speaking whose representative we are: because it is his warning that we give, nothing else but his teaching that we preach, beseeching you to <q>gird up the loins of your mind <span class="stiki" id="note360667"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:13</a></span>,</q> and lead a chaste and sober life in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not to let your mind forget his supremacy and consent to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the flesh. Short and fleeting are the joys of this world's pleasures which endeavour to turn aside from the path of life those who are called to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. The faithful and religious spirit, therefore, must desire the things which are heavenly, and being eager for the Divine promises, lift itself to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the incorruptible Good and the hope of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light. But be sure, dearly-beloved, that your labour, whereby you resist <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and fight against carnal desires, is pleasing and precious in God's sight, and in God's mercy will profit not only yourselves but me also, because the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> pastor makes his boast of the progress of the Lord's flock. <q>For you are my crown and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360668"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:20</a></span>,</q> as the Apostle says; if your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which from the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> has been preached in all the world has continued in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. For though the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is in all the world, ought to abound in all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, yet you especially, above all people, it becomes to excel in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, because founded as you are on the very citadel of the Apostolic Rock, not only has <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> redeemed you in common with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but the blessed Apostle Peter has instructed you far beyond all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Through the same Christ our Lord.</p>
