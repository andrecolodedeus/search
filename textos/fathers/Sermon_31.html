<h1>Sermon 31</h1>

<p> <em>On the Feast of the Epiphany, I.</em></p>

<h2>I. The Epiphany a necessary sequel to the Nativity</h2>

<p>After celebrating but lately the day on which immaculate <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> brought forth the Saviour of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, the venerable feast of the Epiphany, dearly beloved, gives us continuance of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that the force of our exultation and the fervour of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may not grow cool, in the midst of neighbouring and kindred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>.  For it concerns all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that the infancy of the Mediator between God and men was already manifested to the whole world, while He was still detained in the tiny town. For although He had chosen the Israelitish nation, and one <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> out of that nation, from whom to assume the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, yet He was unwilling that the early days of His birth should be concealed within the narrow limits of His mother's home: but desired to be soon recognized by all, seeing that He deigned to be born for all. To three  wise men, therefore, appeared a star of new splendour in the region of the East, which, being brighter and fairer than the other stars, might easily attract the eyes and minds of those that looked on it, so that at once that might be observed not to be meaningless, which had so unusual an appearance. He therefore who gave the sign, gave to the beholders understanding of it, and caused inquiry to be made about that, of which He had thus caused understanding, and after inquiry made, offered Himself to be found.</p>

<h2>II. Herod's evil designs were fruitless. The wise men's gifts were consciously symbolical</h2>

<p>These three men follow the leading of the light above, and with steadfast gaze <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> the indications of the guiding splendour, are led to the recognition of the Truth by the brilliance of Grace, for they supposed that a king's birth was notified in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sense , and that it must be sought in a royal city. Yet He who had taken a slave's form, and had come not to judge, but to be judged, chose <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> for His nativity, Jerusalem for His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>. But <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, hearing that a prince of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was born, suspected a successor, and was in great terror: and to compass the death of the Author of Salvation, pledged himself to a false homage. How <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> had he been, if he had imitated the wise men's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and turned to a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> use what he designed for deceit. What blind <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of foolish jealousy, to think you can overthrow the Divine plan by your frenzy. The Lord of the world, who offers an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Kingdom, seeks not a temporal. Why do you attempt to change the unchangeable order of things ordained, and to forestall others in their crime? The death of Christ belongs not to your time. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> must be first set on foot, the Kingdom of God first preached, healings first given to the sick, wondrous acts first performed. Why do you wish yourself to have the blame of what will belong to another's work, and why without being able to effect your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> design, do you bring on yourself alone the charge of wishing the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? You gain nothing and carriest out nothing by this intriguing. He that was born voluntarily shall die of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. The Wise men, therefore, fulfil their desire, and come to the child, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the same star going before them. They adore the Word in flesh, the Wisdom in infancy, the Power in weakness, the Lord of majesty in the reality of man: and by their gifts make open acknowledgment of what they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in their hearts, that they may show forth the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and understanding.  The <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> they offer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the myrrh to Man, the gold to the King, consciously paying <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the Divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> Nature in union: because while each substance had its own properties, there was no difference in the power  of either.</p>

<h2>III. The massacre of the innocents is in harmony with the Virgin's conception, which again teaches us purity of life</h2>

<p>And when the wise men had returned to their own land, and Jesus had been carried into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> at the Divine suggestion, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> blazes out into fruitless schemes. He orders all the little ones in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> to be slain, and since he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not which infant to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, extends a general sentence against the age he suspects. But that which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> king removes from the world, Christ admits to heaven: and on those for whom He had not yet spent His redeeming blood, He already bestows the dignity of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Lift your faithful hearts then, dearly-beloved, to the gracious blaze of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light, and in adoration of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> dispensed for man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>  give your diligent heed to the things which have been wrought on your behalf. Love the purity of a chaste life, because Christ is the Son of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. <q>Abstain from fleshly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> which <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360856"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:11</a></span>,</q> as the blessed Apostle, present in his words as we read, exhorts us, <q>In <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> be ye children <span class="stiki" id="note360857"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:20</a></span>,</q> because the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> conformed Himself to the infancy of mortals. Follow after humility which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> deigned to teach His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Put on the power of patience, in which you may be able to gain  your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; seeing that He who is the Redemption of all, is also the Strength of all. <q>Set your minds on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth <span class="stiki" id="note360859"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse2">Colossians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> .</q> Walk firmly along the path of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and life: let not earthly things hinder you for whom are prepared heavenly things through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> lives and reigns for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
