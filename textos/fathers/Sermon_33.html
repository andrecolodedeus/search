<h1>Sermon 33</h1>

<p> <em>On the Feast of the Epiphany, III.</em></p>

<h2>I. When we were yet sinners, Christ came to save</h2>

<p>Although I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, dearly-beloved, that you are fully aware of the purpose of today's festival, and that the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>  have according to use unfolded it to you, yet that nothing may be omitted on our part, I shall venture to say on the subject what the Lord has put in my mouth: so that in our common <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> the devotion of our hearts may be so much the more sincere as the reason of our keeping the feast is better understood. The <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> Mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having determined to succour the perishing world in these latter times, fore-ordained the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all nations in the Person of Christ; in order that, because all nations had long been turned aside from the worship of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and even God's peculiar people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had nearly entirely fallen away from the enactments of the Law, now that all were shut up under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> , He might have mercy upon all.</p>

<p>For as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> was everywhere failing and the whole world was given over to vanity and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, if the Divine Power had not deferred its judgment, the whole of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> would have received the sentence of damnation. But <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> was changed to forgiveness, and, that the greatness of the Grace to be displayed might be the more conspicuous, it pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to apply the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of remission to the abolishing of men's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> at a time when no one could boast of his own merits.</p>

<h2>II. The wise men from the East are typical fulfilments of God's promise to Abraham</h2>

<p>Now the manifestation of this unspeakable mercy, dearly-beloved, came to pass when <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> held the royal power in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, where the legitimate succession of Kings having failed and the power of the High-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> having been overthrown, an alien-born had gained the sovereignty: that the rising of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> King might be attested by the voice of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, which had said: <q>a prince shall not fail from Juda, nor a leader from his loins, until He come for whom it is reserved , and He shall be the expectation of the nations.</q> Concerning which an innumerable succession was once promised to the most blessed patriarch <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to be begotten not by fleshly seed but by fertile <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and therefore it was compared to the stars in multitude that as father of all the nations he might hope not for an earthly but for a heavenly progeny. And therefore, for the creating of the promised posterity, the heirs designated under the figure of the stars are awakened by the rising of a new star, that the ministrations of the heaven might do service in that wherein the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the heaven had been adduced. A star more brilliant than the other stars arouses wise men that dwell in the far East, and from the brightness of the wondrous light these men, not unskilled in observing such things, appreciate the importance of the sign: this doubtless being brought about in their hearts by Divine inspiration, in order that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of so great a sight might not be hid from them, and, what was an unusual appearance to their eyes, might not be obscure to their minds. In a word they scrupulously set about their duty and provide themselves with such gifts that in worshipping the One they may at the same time show their belief in His threefold function: with gold they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Person of a King, with myrrh that of Man, with <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> that of God. </p>

<h2>III. The chosen race is no longer the Jews, but believers of every nation</h2>

<p>And so they enter the chief city of the Kingdom of Jud&aelig;a, and in the royal city ask that He should be shown them Whom they had learned was begotten to be King. <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> is perturbed: he fears for his safety, he trembles for his power, he asks of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and teachers of the Law what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has predicted about the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he ascertains what had been prophesied: <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> enlightens the wise men, unbelief blinds the experts: carnal <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> understands not what it reads, sees not what it points out; refers to the pages, whose utterances it does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Where is your boasting, O Jew? Where your noble birth drawn from the stem of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>? Is not your <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> become uncircumcision <span class="stiki" id="note360864"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;2:25</a></span>? Behold, the greater serves the less <span class="stiki" id="note360865"><a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse23">Genesis&nbsp;25:23</a></span>, and by the reading of that covenant  which you keep in the letter only, you become the slave of strangers born, who enter into the lot of your heritage. Let the fullness of the nations enter into the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the patriarchs, yea let it enter, and let the sons of promise receive in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> seed the blessing which his sons, according to the flesh, renounce their claim to. In the three <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>  let all people worship the Author of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>: and let God be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> not in Jud&aelig;a alone, but in all the world, so that everywhere <q>His name</q> may be <q>great in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. </q> For while the dignity of the chosen race is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be degenerate by unbelief in its descendants, it is made common to all alike by our belief.</p>

<h2>IV. The massacre of the Innocents through the consequent flight of Christ, brings the truth into Egypt</h2>

<p>Now when the wise men had worshipped the Lord and finished all their devotions, according to the warning of a dream, they return not by the same route by which they had come. For it behooved them now that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Christ not to walk in the paths of their old line of life, but having entered on a new way to keep away from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> they had left: and it was also to baffle <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> design, who, under the cloke of homage, was planning a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> plot against the Infant Jesus. Hence when his crafty hopes were overthrown, the king's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> rose to a greater fury. For reckoning up the time which the wise men had indicated, he poured out his cruel rage on all the men-children of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and in a general massacre of the whole of that city  slew the infants, who thus passed to their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, thinking that, if every single babe was slain there, Christ too would be slain. But He Who was postponing the shedding of His blood for the world's redemption till another time, was carried and brought into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> aid, and thus sought the ancient cradle of the Hebrew race, and in the power of a greater <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> dispensing the princely office of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Joseph, in that He, the Bread of Life and the Food of reason that came down from heaven, removed that worse than all famines under which the Egyptians' minds were labouring, the lack of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> , nor without that sojourn would the symbolism of that One Victim have been complete; for there first by the slaying of the lamb was fore-shadowed the health-bringing sign of the Cross and the Lord's <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>.</p>

<h2>V. We must keep this festival as thankful sons of light</h2>

<p>Taught then, dearly-beloved, by these <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, let us with reasonable <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> celebrate the day of our <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> and the commencement of the nations' calling: <q>giving thanks to</q> the merciful God <q>who made us worthy,</q> as the Apostle says, <q>to be partakers of the lot of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in light: who delivered us from the power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360871"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse12">Colossians&nbsp;1:12-13</a></span>:</q> since as Isaiah prophesied, <q>the people of the nations that sat in darkness, have seen a great light, and they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them has the light shined <span class="stiki" id="note360872"><a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;9:2</a></span> .</q> Of whom he also said to the Lord, <q>nations which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not you, shall call on you: and peoples which were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of you, shall run together unto you. </q> This day <q><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> saw and was glad <span class="stiki" id="note360874"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse56">John&nbsp;8:56</a></span>,</q> when he understood that the sons of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> would be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in his seed that is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and foresaw that by believing he should be the father of all nations, <q>giving <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and being fully assured that What He had promised, He was able also to perform <span class="stiki" id="note360875"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;4:21</a></span> .</q> This day David sang of in the psalms saying: <q>all nations that you have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord: and they shall glorify Your name ;</q> and again: <q>The Lord has made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> His <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: His righteousness has He openly showed in the sight of the nations. </q> This in good <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have taken place ever since the three wise men aroused in their far-off land were led by a star to recognize and worship the King of heaven and earth, [which to those who gaze aright ceases not daily to appear. And if it could make Christ <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when concealed in infancy, how much more able was it to reveal Him when reigning in majesty].  And surely their worship of Him exhorts us to imitation; that, as far as we can, we should serve our gracious God who invites us all to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For whosoever lives religiously and chastely in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <q>sets his mind on the things which are above, not on the things that are upon the earth <span class="stiki" id="note360879"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse2">Colossians&nbsp;3:2</a></span>,</q> is in some measure like the heavenly light: and while he himself keeps the brightness of a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life, he points out to many the way to the Lord like a star. In which regard, dearly-beloved, you ought all to help one another in turn, that in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, which is reached by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> and good works, you may shine as the sons of light: through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, Who with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> lives and reigns for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
