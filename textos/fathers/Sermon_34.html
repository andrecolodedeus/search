<h1>Sermon 34</h1>

<p> <em>On the Feast of the Epiphany, IV.</em></p>

<h2>I. The yearly observance of the Epiphany is profitable to Christians</h2>

<p>It is the right and reasonable duty of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, dearly-beloved, on the days which bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the works of Divine mercy, to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with the whole heart and to celebrate with all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the things which have been wrought for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: for the very law of recurring seasons calls us to such devout observance, and has now brought before us the feast of the Epiphany, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the Lord's appearance soon after the day on which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> co-eternal with the Father was born of a Virgin. And herein the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God has established a great safeguard to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that, while the worship of the Saviour's earliest infancy is repeated year by year, the production of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man's nature in Him might be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the original verifications themselves. For this it is that justifies the ungodly, this it is that makes sinners <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, to wit the belief in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Manhood of the one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our Lord: the Godhead, whereby being before all ages <q>in the form of God</q> He is equal with the Father: the Manhood whereby in the last days He is united to Man in the <q>form of a slave.</q> For the confirmation therefore of this Faith which was to be fore-armed against all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, it was a wondrous loving provision of the Divine plan that a nation which dwelt in the far-off country of the East and was cunning in the art of reading the stars, should receive the sign of the infant's birth who was to reign over all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. For the unwonted splendour of a bright new star appeared to the wise men and filled their mind with such wonder, as they gazed upon its brilliance, that they could not think they ought to neglect what was announced to them with such distinctness. And, as the event showed, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God was the disposing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this wondrous thing: who when the whole of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> itself was still unaware of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth, brought it to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the nations who would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and declared that which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> words could not yet explain, through the preaching of the heavens.</p>

<h2>II. Both Herod and the wise men originally had an earthly conception of the kingdom signified; but the latter learned the truth, the former did not</h2>

<p>But although it was the office of the Divine condescension to make the Saviour's Nativity recognizable to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, yet for the understanding of the wondrous sign the wise men could have had intimation even from the ancient prophecies of Balaam, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it was predicted of old and by constant repetition spread abroad: <q>A star shall rise out of Jacob, and a man shall rise out of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and shall rule the nations. </q> And so the three men aroused by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the shining of a strange star, follow the guidance of its twinkling light, thinking they will find the babe designated at Jerusalem in the royal city. But finding themselves mistaken in this opinion, through the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and teachers of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> they learned what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> had foretold of the birth of Christ; so that confirmed by a twofold <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, they sought with still more eager <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> Him whom both the brightness of the star and the sure word of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> revealed. And when the Divine oracle was proclaimed through the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests'</a> answers and the Spirit's voice declared, which says: <q>And you, <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, the land of Judah, are not least among the princes of Judah; for out of you shall come a leader to rule My people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360881"><a href="../bible/mic005.htm#verse2">Micah&nbsp;5:2</a></span>,</q> how easy and how natural it was that the leading men among the Hebrews should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what they taught! But it appears that they held material notions with <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, and reckoned Christ's kingdom as on the same level as the powers of this world: so that they hoped for a temporal leader while he dreaded an earthly rival. The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that racks you, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, is wasted; in vain do you try to vent your rage on the infant you suspect. Your realm cannot hold Christ; the Lord of the world is not satisfied with the narrow limits of your sway. He, whom you do not wish to reign in Jud&aelig;a, reigns everywhere: and you would rule more happily yourself, if you were to submit to His command. Why do you not do with sincerity what in treacherous falseness you promise? Come with the wise men, and in suppliant adoration worship the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> King. But you, from too great fondness for Jewish blindness, will not imitate the nations' <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and directest your stubborn heart to cruel wiles, though you are doomed neither to stay Him whom you fear nor to harm them whom you slay.</p>

<h2>III. The perseverance of the Magihas led to the most important results</h2>

<p>Led then, dearly beloved, into <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> by <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> the guidance of the star, the wise men <q>rejoiced with very great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>,</q> as the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> has told us: <q>and entering the house, found the child with Mary, His mother; and falling down they worshipped Him; and opening their treasures they presented to Him gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh <span class="stiki" id="note360882"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;2:10-11</a></span> .</q> What wondrous <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which was taught them not by earthly wisdom, but by the instruction of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>! Whence came it that these men, who had quitted their country without having seen Jesus, and had not noticed anything in His looks to enforce such systematic adoration, observed this method in offering their gifts? Unless it were that besides the appearance of the star, which attracted their bodily eyes, the more refulgent rays of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> taught their hearts that before they started on their toilsome road, they must understand that He was signified to Whom was owed in gold royal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, in <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> Divine adoration, in myrrh the acknowledgment of mortality. Such a belief and understanding no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, as far as the enlightenment of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> went, might have been sufficient in themselves and have prevented their using their bodily eyes in inquiring into that which they had beheld with their mind's fullest gaze. But their sagacious diligence, persevering till they found the child, did good service for future peoples and for the men of our own time: so that, as it profited us all that the apostle Thomas, after the Lord's resurrection, handled the traces of the wounds in His flesh, so it was of advantage to us that His infancy should be attested by the visit of the wise men. And so the wise men saw and adored the Child of the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>, <q>of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh <span class="stiki" id="note360883"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;1:3</a></span>,</q> <q>made from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the law <span class="stiki" id="note360884"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm">Galatians&nbsp;iv</a></span>,</q> which He had come <q>not to destroy but to fulfil <span class="stiki" id="note360885"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;5:17</a></span> .</q> They saw and adored the Child, small in size, powerless to help others , incapable of speech, and in nought different to the generality of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> children. Because, as the testimonies were trustworthy which asserted in Him the majesty of invisible Godhead, so it ought to be impossible to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <q>the Word became flesh,</q> and the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> took man's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature: lest either the inexpressible marvels of his acts which were to follow or the infliction of sufferings which He had to bear should overthrow the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our Faith by their inconsistency: seeing that no one at all can be justified save those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the Lord Jesus to be both <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Man.</p>

<h2>IV. The Manich&aelig;an heresy corrupts the Scriptures in order to disprove the truth</h2>

<p>This peerless Faith, dearly-beloved, this Truth proclaimed throughout all ages, is opposed by the devilish <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>: who to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the deceived have woven a deadly tissue of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">wicked doctrine</a> out of impious and forged lies, and over the ruins of their mad opinions men have fallen headlong to such depths as to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> a Christ with a fictitious body, who presented nothing solid, nothing real to the eyes and touch of men , but displayed an empty shape of fancy-flesh. For they wish it to be thought unworthy of belief that God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> placed Himself within a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> body and subjected His majesty to such a degradation as to be joined to our fleshly nature and be born in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> substance although this is entirely the outcome of His power, not of His ill-treatment, and it is His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> condescension, not His being polluted that should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in. For if yonder visible light is not marred by any of the uncleannesses with which it is encompassed, and the brightness of the sun's rays, which is doubtless a material creature, is not contaminated by any of the dirty or muddy places to which it penetrates, is there anything whatever its quality which could pollute the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and immaterial Light? Seeing that by allying Himself to that creature which He had made after His own image He furnished it with purification and received no stain, and healed the wounds of its weakness without suffering loss of power. And because this great and unspeakable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of divine Godliness was announced by all the testimonies of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, those opponents of the Truth of which we speak have rejected the law that was given through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the divinely inspired utterances  of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and have tampered with the very pages of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, by removing or inserting certain things: forging for themselves under the Apostles' names and under the words of the Saviour Himself many volumes of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, whereby to fortify their lying <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and instil deadly poison into the minds of those to be deceived. For they saw that everything contradicted and made against them and that not only by the New but also by the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> and treacherous folly was confuted. And yet persisting in their mad lies they cease not to disturb the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> with their deceits, persuading those miserable creatures whom they can ensnare to deny that man's nature was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> taken by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>; to deny that He was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> crucified for the world's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: to deny that from His side wounded by the spear flowed the blood of Redemption and the water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> : to deny that He was buried and raised again the third day: to deny that in sight of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> He was lifted above all the heights of the skies to take His seat on the right hand of the Father; and in order that when all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Apostles' Creed was destroyed, there may be nothing to frighten the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> or inspire the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> with hope, to deny that the living and the dead must be judged by Christ; so that those whom they have <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> of the power of these great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> may learn to worship Christ in the sun and moon, and under the name of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to adore Manich&aelig;us himself, the inventor of all these <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>.</p>

<h2>V. Avoid all dealings with the heretics, but intercede with God for them</h2>

<p>To confirm your hearts therefore, dearly-beloved, in the Faith and Truth, let today's festival help you all, and let the catholic confession be fortified by the testimony of the manifestation of the Saviour's infancy, while we <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of those who deny the flesh of our nature in Christ: about which the blessed Apostle John has forewarned us in no doubtful utterance, saying, <q>every spirit which confesses Christ Jesus to have come in the flesh is of God: and every spirit which destroys Jesus is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this is <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. </q> Consequently let no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> have anything in common with men of this kind, let him have no alliance or intercourse with such. Let it advantage the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that many of them in the mercy of God have been discovered, and that their own confession has disclosed how <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> their lives were. Let no one be deceived by their discriminations between food and food, by their soiled raiment, by their pale faces. Fasts are not <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> which proceed not on the principle of abstinence but with deceitful design. Let this be the end of their harming the unwary, and deluding the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>; henceforth no one's fall shall be excusable: no longer must he be held simple but extremely worthless and perverse who hereafter shall be found entangled in detestable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. A practice countenanced by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and Divinely instituted, not only do we not forbid, we even incite you to, that you should supplicate the Lord even for such: since we also with tears and mourning feel pity for the ruins of cheated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, carrying out the Apostles' example of loving-kindness , so as to be weak with those that are weak and to <q>weep with those that weep. </q> For we hope that God's mercy can be won by the many tears and due amendment of the fallen: because so long as life remains in the body no man's restoration must be despaired of, but the reform of all desired with the Lord's help, <q>who raises up them that are crushed, looses them that are chained, gives light to the blind :</q> to whom is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
