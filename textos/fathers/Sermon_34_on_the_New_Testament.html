<h1>Sermon 34 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[LXXXIV. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse17">Matthew 19:17</a> <em>, <q>If you would enter into life, keep the commandments.</q></em></p>

<p>1. The Lord said to a certain young man, <q>If you will enter into life, keep the commandments.</q>  He did not say, <q>If you will enter into life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>,</q> but <q>If you will enter into life;</q> laying down that as life, which is to be life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Let us first then set forth the value of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of this life. For even this present life, under whatever circumstances, is loved; and men <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and dread to end it of whatever kind it be; however full of trouble and misery. Hence may we see, hence consider, how the life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> should be loved; when this life so miserable, and which must sometime come to an end, is loved so much. Consider, Brethren, how greatly should that life be loved, where you will never end life. Thou dost <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, it seems, this present life, where you labour so much, hastest to and fro, art busy, sufferest fatigue; yea scarcely to be enumerated are the necessities of this miserable life; sowing, ploughing, clearing the ground, sailing, grinding, cooking, weaving; and after all these things you have to end your life. See the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> you suffer in this miserable life, which you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; and do you think that you shall always live, and never die? Temples, stones, marbles, joined so strongly together with iron and lead, fall into ruin for all their strength; and does a man suppose that he shall never die? Learn then, Brethren, to seek for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, where you will not endure all this, but will reign with God for ever. <q>For he who wishes life,</q> as the Prophet says, <q>loves to see good days.</q>  For in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> days death is rather wished for than life. Do we not hear and see men when they are involved in some tribulations and distresses, in law-suits or sicknesses and they see that they are in travail, do we not hear them saying nothing else but, <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, send me death, hasten my days</q>? Yet when sickness comes, they run about, and physicians are fetched, and money and rewards are promised. Death himself says to you, <q>Lo, here I am, whom but a little while ago you were asking of the Lord, why would you fly from me now? I have found you to be a self-deceiver, and a lover of this miserable life.</q></p>

<p>2. But as concerning these days which we are passing now, the Apostle says, <q>Redeeming the time, because the days are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q>  Are not these days indeed <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which we spend in this corruptible flesh, in or under so heavy a load of the corruptible body, amid so great <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, amid so great difficulties, where there is but false pleasure, no security of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, a tormenting <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, a greedy <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, a withering sadness? Lo, what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> days! Yet no one is willing to end these same <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> days, and hence men earnestly <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> God that they may live long. Yet what is it to live long, but to be long tormented? What is it to live long, but to add <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> days to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> days? When boys are growing up, it is as if days are being added to them; whereas they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are being diminished; and their very reckoning is false. For as we grow in up, the number of our days rather diminishes than increases. Appoint for any man at his birth, for instance, eighty years; every day he lives, he diminishes somewhat of that sum. Yet silly men <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at the oft-recurring birthdays, both of themselves and their children. O sensible man! If the wine in your bottle is diminished, you are sad; days are you losing, and are you glad? These days then are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and so much the more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in that they are loved. This world is so alluring, that no one is willing to finish a life of sorrow. For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the blessed life is this, when we shall rise again, and reign with Christ. For the ungodly too shall rise again but to go into the fire. Life then is there again, but that which is blessed. And blessed life there can be none but that which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, where are <q>good days;</q> and those not many days, but one day. They are called <q>days</q> after the custom of this life. That day <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no rising, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no setting. To that day there succeeds no tomorrow; because no yesterday precedes it. This day, or these days, and this life, this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life, have we in promise. It is then the reward of a certain work. So if we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the reward, let us not fail in the work; and so shall we reign with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> for ever.</p>
