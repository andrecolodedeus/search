<h1>Sermon 40 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[XC. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse2">Matthew 22:2</a> <em>, etc., about the marriage of the king's son; against the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, on charity. Delivered at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> in the Restituta</em>. </p>

<p>1. All the faithful  <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the marriage of the king's son, and his feast, and the spreading  of the Lord's Table is open to them all  who will. But it is of importance to each one to see how he approaches, even when he is not forbidden to approach It. For the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> teach us that there are two feasts of the Lord; one to which the good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> come, the other to which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> come not. So then the feast, of which we have just now heard when the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was being read, has both good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> guests. All who excused themselves from this feast are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but not all those who entered in are good. You therefore who are the good guests at this feast do I address, who have in your minds the words, <q>He that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks judgment to himself.</q>  All you who are such do I address, that you look not for the good without, that you bear with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> within.</p>

<p>2. I do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that you wish to hear, Beloved, who they are of whom I have spoken in my address, that they should not look for the good without, and should bear with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> within. If all within are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, whom do I address? If all within are good, whom did I advise them to bear with being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? Let me first then with the Lord's assistance get out of this difficulty as best I can. If you consider good perfectly and strictly  speaking, none is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> but God Alone. You have the Lord saying most plainly, <q>Why do you call Me good? There is none Good but One, that is, God.</q>  How then can that marriage feast have good and bad guests, if <q>none is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> but God Alone</q>? In the first place ye ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that after a certain sort we are all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Yes, doubtless after a certain sort are we all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but after no sort are we all good. For can we compare ourselves with the Apostles, to whom the Lord Himself said, <q>If you then being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to give good gifts unto your children?</q>  If we consider the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, there was but one <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one among the twelve Apostles, with reference to whom the Lord said in a certain place, <q>And you are clean, but not all.</q>  But yet in addressing them all together, He said, <q>If you being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> Peter heard this, John heard this, Andrew heard this, all the rest of the eleven Apostles heard it. What did they hear? <q>If you being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to give good gifts unto your children; how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to them that ask Him?</q> When they heard that they were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, they were in despair; but when they heard that God in heaven was their Father, they revived. <q>You being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>;</q> what then is due to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but punishment? <q>How much more shall your Father which is in heaven?</q> What is due to children but reward. In the name of <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></q> is the dread of punishment; in the name of <q>children</q> is the hope of heirs.</p>

<p>3. According to a certain respect then they were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, who after another respect were good. For to them to whom it is said, <q>You being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to give good gifts unto your children;</q> is added immediately, <q>How much more shall your Father which is in heaven?</q> He is then the Father of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but not of those who are to be left so; because He is the Physician of them who are to be cured. According to a certain sort then they were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And yet those guests of the Householder at the King's marriage, were not I suppose of that number of whom it was said, <q>they invited good and bad,</q>  that they should be reckoned among the number of the bad, who we have heard were shut out in his person who was found not to have a wedding garment. According to a certain respect, I repeat they were bad, who yet were good; and according to a certain respect they were good, who yet were bad. Hear John according to what respect they were bad: <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.</q>  Behold after what respect they were bad: because they had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. According to what respect were they good? <q>If we confess our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, He is faithful and just to forgive us our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</q>  If then we should say, on the principle of this interpretation which you have now heard me bring, as I think, out of the sacred Scriptures, viz. that the same men are both after a certain manner, good, and after a certain manner bad; if we should wish to receive according to this sense the words, <q>they invited good and bad,</q> the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, that is, at once good and bad; if we should wish so to receive them, we are not permitted so to do, by reason of that one who was found <q>not having a wedding garment,</q> and who was not merely <q>cast forth,</q> so as to be deprived of that feast, but so as to be condemned in the punishment of everlasting darkness.</p>

<p>4. But one will say, What of one man? What strange, what great matter is it, if one among the crowd <q>not having a wedding garment</q> crept in unperceived to the servants of the Householder? Could it be said because of that one, <q>they invited good and bad</q>? Attend therefore, my Brethren, and understand. That one man represented one class; for they were many. Here some diligent hearer may answer me, and say, <q>I have no wish for you to tell me your guesses; I wish to have it <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to me that that one represented many.</q>  By the Lord's present help, I will prove it clearly; nor will I search far, that I may be able to prove it. God will assist me in His own words in this place, and will furnish you by my ministry with a plain <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of it. <q>The Master of the house came in to see the guests.</q>  See, my Brethren, the servants' business was only to invite and bring in the good and bad; see that it is not said, that the servants took notice of the guests, and found among them a man which had not on a wedding garment, and spoke to him. This is not written. The Master of the house saw him, the Master of the house discovered, the Master of the house inspected, the Master of the house separated him out. It was not right to pass over this. But I have undertaken to establish another point, how that that one signifies many. <q>The Master of the house</q> then <q>came in to see the guests, and He found there a man which had not on a wedding garment. And He says unto him, Friend, how did you come in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</q>  For He who questioned him was One, to whom he could give no feigned reply. The garment that was looked for is in the heart, not on the body; for had it been put on externally, it could not have been concealed even from the servants. Where that wedding garment must be put on, hear in the words, <q>Let your <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> be clothed with righteousness.</q>  Of that garment the Apostle speaks,  <q>If so be that we shall be found clothed, and not naked.</q>  Therefore was he discovered by the Lord, who escaped the notice of the servants. Being questioned, he is speechless: he is bound, cast out, and condemned one by many. I have said, Lord, that Thou teachest us that in this Thou dost give warning to all. Recollect then with me, my Brethren, the words which you have heard, and you will at once discover, at once determine, that that one was many. True it was one man whom the Lord questioned, to one He said, <q>Friend, how did you come in hither?</q> It was one who was speechless, and of that same one was it said, <q>Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</q>  Why? <q>For many are called, but few chosen.</q>  How can any one gainsay this manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? <q>Cast him,</q> He says, <q>into outer darkness.</q> <q>Him,</q> that one man assuredly, of whom the Lord says, <q>for many are called, but few chosen.</q> So then it is the few who are not cast out. He was it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> but one man <q>who had not the wedding garment. Cast him out.</q> But why is he cast out? <q>For many are called, but few chosen.</q> Leave alone the few, cast out the many. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that man was but one. Yet undoubtedly that one not only was many, but those many in numbers far surpassed the number of the good. For the good are many also; but in comparison of the bad, they are few. In the crop there is much wheat; compare it with the chaff, and the grains of grain are few. The same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> considered in themselves are many, in comparison with the bad are few. How do we prove that in themselves they are many? <q>Many shall come from the East and from the West.</q> Whither shall they come? To that feast, into which both good and bad enter. But speaking of another feast, He subjoined, <q>and shall sit down with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q>  That is the feast to which the bad shall not approach. Be that feast which now is, received worthily, that we may attain to the other. The same then are many, who are also few; in themselves many; in comparison with the bad few. Therefore what says the Lord? He found one, and said, <q>Let the many be cast out, the few remain.</q> For to say, <q>many are called, but few chosen,</q> is nothing else than to show plainly who in this present feast are accounted to be such, as to be brought to that other feast, where no bad men shall come.</p>

<p>5. What is it then? I would not that you all who approach the Lord's Table which is in this life, should be with the many who are to be shut out, but with the few who are to be reserved. And how shall you be able to attain to this? Take <q>the wedding garment.</q> You will say, <q>Explain this 'wedding garment' to us.</q> Without a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that is the garment which none but the good have, who are to be left at the feast, reserved unto that other feast to which no bad man approaches, who are to be brought safely there by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord; these have <q>the wedding garment.</q> Let us then, my Brethren, seek for those among the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who have something which bad men have not, and this will be <q>the wedding garment.</q> If we speak of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, you see how that these are common to the bad and good. Is it Baptism? Without Baptism it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> no one attains to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but not every one that has Baptism attains to Him. I cannot therefore understand Baptism, the Sacrament itself that is, to be <q>the wedding garment;</q> for this garment I see in the good, I see in the bad. Peradventure it is the Altar, or That which is received at the Altar. But no; we see that many eat, and <q>eat and drink judgment to themselves.</q> What is it then? Is it <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>? The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> fast also. Is it running together to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> run there also. Lastly, is it <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>? Not only do the good and bad perform them, but sometimes the good perform them not. See, among the ancient people <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh's</a> magicians wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> did not; among the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> only and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> wrought them; the rest did not, but saw, and feared, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.  Were the magicians of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> who did <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, better men than the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> who could not do them, and yet that people were the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, hear the Apostle, <q>Are all <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? Have all the gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues?</q> </p>

<p>6. What is that <q>wedding garment</q> then? This is the wedding garment: <q>Now the end of the commandment,</q> says the Apostle, <q>is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned.</q>  This is <q>the wedding garment.</q> Not charity of any kind whatever; for very often they who are partakers together of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> seem to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another. They who commit robberies together, who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the hurtful arts of sorceries, and the stage together, who join together in the shout of the chariot race, or the wild beast fight; these very often <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another; but in these there is no <q>charity out of a pure heart, and of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned. The wedding garment</q> is such charity as this. <q>Though I speak with the tongues of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and of Angels, and have not charity, I have become as sounding brass, and a tinkling cymbal.</q>  Tongues have come in alone, and it is said to them, <q>How came ye in hither not having a wedding garment?</q> <q>Though,</q> said he, <q>I have the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and understand all <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and though I have all <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</q> See, these are the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of men who very often have not <q>the wedding garment.</q> <q>Though,</q> he says, <q>I have all these, and have not Christ, I am nothing.</q> Is then <q>the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a></q> nothing? Is then <q>the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a></q>  nothing? It is not that these are nothing; but <q>I,</q> if I have them, <q>and have not charity, am nothing.</q> How many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things profit nothing without this one good thing! If then I have not charity, though I bestow <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> freely upon the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, though I have come to the confession of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Name even unto blood and fire, these things may be done even through the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and so are vain. Because then they may be done even from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and so be vain, and not through the rich charity of a godly affection, he names them all also in express terms, and you give ear to them; <q>though I distribute all my goods for the use of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profits me nothing.</q>  This then is <q>the wedding garment.</q> Question yourselves; if you have it, you may be without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in the Feast of the Lord. In one and the same man there exist two things, charity and desire. Let charity be born in you, if it be yet unborn, and if it be born, be it nourished, fostered, increased. But as to that desire, though in this life it cannot be utterly extinguished; <q>for if we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us;</q>  but in so far as desire is in us, so far we are not without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: let charity increase, desire decrease; that the one, that is, charity, may one day be perfected, and desire be consumed. Put on <q>the wedding garment:</q> you I address, who as yet have it not. You are already within, already do ye approach to the Feast, and still have ye not yet the garment to do <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the Bridegroom; <q>You are yet seeking your own things, not the things which are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>'s.</q>  For <q>the wedding garment</q> is taken in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the union, the union, that is, of the Bridegroom to the Bride. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Bridegroom; it is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Bride; it is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Pay <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>  to the Bride, pay <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the Bridegroom. If you pay due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to them both, you will be their children. Therefore in this make progress. Love the Lord, and so learn to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> yourselves; that when by loving the Lord you shall have loved yourselves, you may securely <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourselves. For when I find a man that does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> himself, how shall I commit his neighbour whom he should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> as himself to him? And who is there, you will say, who does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> himself? Who is there? See, <q>He that loves iniquity <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q>  Does he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> himself, who loves his body, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to his own hurt, to the hurt of both his body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? And who loves his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? He that loves God with all his heart and with all his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. To such an one I would at once entrust his neighbour. <q>Love your neighbour as yourselves.</q></p>

<p>7. One may say, <q>Who is my neighbour?</q> Every man is your neighbour. Had we not all the same two <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>? Animals of every species are neighbours one to the other, the dove to the dove, the leopard to the leopard, the asp to the asp, the sheep to the sheep, and is not man neighbour to man? Call to mind the ordering of the creation. God spoke, the waters brought forth swimming creatures, great whales, fish, birds, and such like things. Did all the birds come of one bird? Did all vultures come of one vulture? Did all doves come of one dove? Did all snakes come of one snake? Or all gilt-heads of one gilt-head?  or all sheep of one sheep? No, the earth assuredly brought forth all these kinds together. But when it came to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the earth did not bring forth man. One father was made for us; not even two, father and mother: one father, I say, was made for us, not even two, father and mother; but out of the one father came the one mother; the one father came from none, but was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the one mother came out of him. Mark then the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of our race: we flowed out of one fountain; and because that one was turned to bitterness, we all became from a good, a wild olive tree. And so <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> came also. One begot us unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death, yet as one race, yet as neighbours one to another, yet as not merely like, but related to each other. There came <em>One</em> against <em>one</em>; against the one who scattered, One who gathers. Thus against the one who slays, is the One who makes alive. <q>For as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</q>  Now as whosoever is born of the first, dies; so whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Christ is made alive. Provided, that is, that he have <q>the wedding garment,</q> and be invited as one who is to remain, and not to be cast out.</p>

<p>8. So then, my Brethren, have charity. I have explained it to be this garment, this <q>wedding garment.</q> Faith is praised, it is plain, it is praised: but what kind of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> this is, the Apostle distinguishes. For certain who boasted of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and had not a good conversation, the Apostle James rebukes and says, <q>You believe there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, you do well; the devils also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and tremble.</q>  Call to mind with me whereupon Peter was praised, whereupon called blessed. Was it because he said, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living God</q>?  He who pronounced Him blessed, regarded not the sound of the words, but the affection of the heart. For would ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Peter's blessedness lay not in these words? The devils also said the same. <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You who You are, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q>  Peter confessed Him to be <q>the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;</q> the devils confessed Him to be <q>the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> <q>Distinguish, my lord, distinguish between the two.</q> I do make a plain distinction. Peter spoke in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the devils from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. And again Peter says, <q>I am with You, even unto death.</q>  The devils say, <q>What have we to do with You?</q> So then you who have come to the feast, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> only. Distinguish well the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and then in you is recognised <q>the wedding garment.</q> Let the Apostle make the distinction, let him teach us; <q>neither <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> avails anything, nor uncircumcision, but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q>  Tell us, what <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Do not even the devils <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and tremble? I will tell you, he says, and listen, I will now draw the distinction, <q>But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> What <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, then, and of what kind? <q>That which works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> <q>Though I have all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,</q> he says, <q>and all <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</q> Have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ye cannot have. This I warn, this I exhort, this in the name of the Lord I teach you, Beloved, that you have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; for you may possibly have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. I do not exhort you to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For you cannot have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> I mean of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and your neighbour; whence can it come without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? How does he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God? How does the fool <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>who says in his heart, there is no God</q>?  Possible it is that you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Christ has come and not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ. But it is not possible that you should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and yet say that Christ has not come.</p>

<p>9. So then, have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. This is the <q>wedding garment.</q> You who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your friends, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your enemies. Let not this be hard to you. What then do ye lose thereby, when you gain so much? What? Do you ask of God as some great favour, that your enemy may die? This is not <q>the wedding garment.</q> Turn your thoughts to the Bridegroom Himself hanging upon the Cross for you, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to His Father for His enemies; <q>Father,</q> says He, <q>forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do.</q>  You have seen the Bridegroom speaking thus; see too the friend of the Bridegroom, a guest <q>with the wedding garment.</q> Look at the blessed Stephen, how he rebukes the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as though in rage and resentment, <q>You stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you have resisted the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Which of the Prophets have not your fathers killed?</q>  You have heard how severe he is with his tongue. And at  once you are prepared to speak against any one; and I would it were against him who offends <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not who offends you. One offends <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and you do not rebuke him; he offends you, and you cry out; where is that <q>wedding garment</q>? You have heard therefore how Stephen was severe; now hear how he loved. He offended those whom he was rebuking, and was <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> by them. And as he was being overwhelmed and bruised to death by the hands of his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> persecutors on every side, and the blows of the stones, he first said, <q>Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, receive my spirit.</q>  Then after he had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for himself standing, he bent the knee for them who were <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoning</a> him, and said, <q>Lord, lay not this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to their charge; let me die in my body, but let not these die in their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.</q>  After these words he added no more; he spoke them and departed; his last <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was for his enemies. Learn ye hereby to have <q>the wedding garment.</q> So do you too bend the knee, and beat your forehead against the ground, and as you are about to approach the Table of the Lord, the Feast of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, do not say, <q>O that mine enemy might die! Lord, if I have deserved ought of You, slay mine enemy.</q> Because if so be that you say so, do you not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest He should answer you, <q>If I should choose to slay your enemy, I should first slay you. What! Do you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> because you have now come invited hither? Think only what you were but a little while ago. Have you not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> Me? Have you not derided Me? Did you not wish to wipe out My Name from off the earth? Yet now you applaud yourself because you have come invited hither! If I had slain you when you were Mine enemy, how could I have made you My friend? Why, by your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> do you teach Me to do, what I did not in your own case?</q> Yea rather God says to you, <q>Let me teach you to imitate Me. When I was hanging on the Cross, I said, 'Forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do.'  This lesson I taught My brave soldier. Be My recruit against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. In no other way will you fight at all unconquerably, unless you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for your enemies. Yet by all means ask this, yea ask this very thing, ask that you may <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> your enemy; but ask it with discernment; distinguish well what you ask. See, a man is your enemy; answer me, what is it in him which is at enmity with you? Is it in this, that he is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that he is at enmity with you? No. What then? That he is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In that he is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in that he is that I made him, he is not at enmity with you.</q> He says to you, I did not make man <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; he became <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by disobedience, who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>  rather than God. What he has made himself, is at enmity with you; in that he is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he is your enemy; not in that he is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For I hear the word <q>man,</q> and <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>;</q> the one is the name of nature, the other of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> I cure; and the nature I preserve. And so your God says to you, <q>See, I do avenge you, I do slay your enemy; I take away that which makes him <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, I preserve that which constitutes him a man: now if I shall have made him a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, have I not slain your enemy, and made him your friend?</q> So ask on what you are asking, not that the men may perish, but that these their enmities may perish. For if you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for this, that the man may die; it is the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of one <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man against another; and when you say, <q>Slay the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one,</q> God answers you, <q>Which of you?</q></p>

<p>10. Extend your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> then, and limit it not to your wives and children. Such <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is found even in beasts and sparrows. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the sparrows and the swallows how they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their mates, how together they hatch their eggs, and nourish their young together, by a sort of free  and natural kindliness, and with no thought of a return. For the sparrow does not say, <q>I will nourish my young, that when I am grown old, they may feed me.</q> He has no such thought; he loves and feeds them, for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of them; displays the affection of a parent, and looks for no return. And so, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, I am sure, do ye <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your children. <q>For the children ought not to lay up for the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> for the children.</q>  Yea upon this plea it is that many of you excuse your <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, that you are getting for your children, and are laying by for them.  But I say, extend your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, let this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> grow; for to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wives and children, is not yet that <q>wedding garment.</q> Have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to Godward. First <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God. Extend yourselves out to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and whomsoever you shall be able, draw on to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. There is your enemy: let him be drawn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. There is a son, a wife, a servant; let them be all drawn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. There is a stranger; let him be drawn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. There is an enemy; let him be drawn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Draw, draw on your enemy; by drawing him on he shall cease to be your enemy. So let charity be advanced, so be it nourished, that being nourished it may be perfected; so be <q>the wedding garment</q> put on; so be the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, after which we were created, by this our advancing, engraven anew in us. For by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was it bruised, and worn away. How is it bruised? How worn away? When it is rubbed against the earth? And what is, <q>When it is rubbed against the earth</q>? When it is worn by earthly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>. For <q>though man  walks in this image, yet is he disquieted in vain.</q>  Truth is looked for in God's image, not vanity. By the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> then be that image, after which we were created, engraven anew, and His Own tribute rendered to our C&aelig;sar. For so you have heard from the Lord's answer, when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> tempted Him, as He said, <q>Why do you tempt Me, you hypocrites; show Me the tribute money,</q>  that is, the impress and superscription of the image. Show me what ye pay, what ye get ready, what is exacted of you. And <q>they showed Him a denarius;</q> and <q>He asked whose image and superscription it had.</q> They answered, <q>C&aelig;sar's.</q> So C&aelig;sar looks for his own image. It is not C&aelig;sar's will that what he ordered to be made should be lost to him, and it is not surely <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that what He has made should be lost to Him. C&aelig;sar, my Brethren, did not make the money; the masters of the mint  make it; the workmen have their orders, he issues his commands to his ministers. His image was stamped upon the money; on the money was C&aelig;sar's image. And yet he requires what others have stamped; he puts it in his treasures; he will not have it refused him. Christ's coin is man. In him is Christ's image, in him Christ's Name, Christ's gifts, Christ's rules of duty. </p>
