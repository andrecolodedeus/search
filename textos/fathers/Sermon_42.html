<h1>Sermon 42</h1>

<p> <em>On Lent, IV.</em></p>

<h2>I. <em>The Lenten fast an opportunity for restoring our purity.</em></h2>

<p>In proposing to preach this most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and important fast to you, dearly beloved, how shall I begin more fitly than by quoting the words of the Apostle, in whom Christ Himself was speaking, and by reminding you of what we have read : <q>behold, now is the acceptable time, behold now is the day of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q> For though there are no seasons which are not full of Divine blessings, and though access is ever open to us to God's mercy through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, yet now all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> minds should be moved with greater <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to spiritual progress, and animated by larger confidence, when the return of the day, on which we were redeemed, invites us to all the duties of godliness: that we may keep the super-excellent <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Lord's passion with bodies and hearts purified. These great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> do indeed require from us such unflagging devotion and unwearied reverence that we should remain in God's sight always the same, as we ought to be found on the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> feast itself. But because few have this constancy, and, because so long as the stricter observance is relaxed in consideration of the frailty of the flesh, and so long as one's interests extend over all the various actions of this life, even <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> hearts must get some soils from the dust of the world, the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> has with great beneficence taken care that the discipline of the forty days should heal us and restore the purity of our minds, during which the faults of other times might be redeemed by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> acts and removed by chaste <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>.</p>

<h2>II. Lent must be used for removing all our defilements, and of good works there must be no stint</h2>

<p>As we are therefore, dearly-beloved, about to enter on those mystic days which are dedicated to the benefits of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, let us take care to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the Apostle's precepts, cleansing <q>ourselves from every defilement of flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360922"><a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:1</a></span>:</q> that by controlling the struggles that go on between our two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, the spirit which, if it is under the guidance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, should be the governor of the body, may uphold the dignity of its rule: so that we may give no offense to any, nor be subject to the chidings of reprovers. For we shall be rightly attacked with rebukes, and through our fault ungodly tongues will arm themselves to do harm to religion, if the conduct of those that fast is at variance with the standard of perfect purity. For our fast does not consist chiefly of mere abstinence from food, nor are dainties withdrawn from our bodily appetites with profit, unless the mind is recalled from wrong-doing and the tongue restrained from <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandering</a>. This is a time of gentleness and long-suffering, of peace and tranquillity: when all the pollutions of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> are to be eradicated and continuance of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is to be attained by us. Now let godly minds boldly accustom themselves to forgive faults, to pass over insults, and to forget wrongs. Now let the faithful spirit train himself with the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, that through <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and dishonour, through ill repute and good repute, the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> may be undisturbed in unwavering uprightness, not puffed up by praise and not wearied out by revilings. The self-restraint of the religious should not be gloomy, but sincere; no murmurs of complaint should be heard from those who are never without the consolation of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> joys. The decrease of worldly means should not be feared in the practice of works of mercy. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> poverty is always rich, because what it has is more than what it has not. Nor does the poor man <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to labour in this world, to whom it is given to possess all things in the Lord of all things. Therefore those who do the things which are good must have no manner of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest the power of doing should fail them; since in the gospel the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> devotion is extolled in the case of her two mites, and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> bounty gets its reward for a cup of cold water.  For the measure of our charitableness is fixed by the sincerity of our feelings, and he that shows mercy on others will never want for mercy himself. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Sarepta discovered this, who offered the blessed Elias in the time of famine one day's food, which was all she had, and putting the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> hunger before her own needs, ungrudgingly gave up a handful of grain and a little oil.  But she did not lose what she gave in all <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and in the vessels emptied by her godly bounty a source of new plenty arose, that the fullness of her substance might not be diminished by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> purpose to which she had put it, because she had never dreaded being brought to want.</p>

<h2>III. As with the Saviour, so with us, the devil tries to make our very piety its own snare</h2>

<p>But, dearly-beloved, <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who is the opponent of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, is jealous of these good desires, to which we are confident you are prompted of your own selves, and that to this end he is arming the force of his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> in order to make your very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> its own snare, and endeavouring to overcome by boastfulness those whom he could not defeat by distrustfulness. For the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is a near neighbour to good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and arrogance ever lies in wait hard by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: because it is hard for him that lives praise-worthily not to be caught by man's praise unless, as it is written, <q>he that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> in the Lord <span class="stiki" id="note360925"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:17</a></span> .</q> Whose intentions would that most naughty enemy not dare to attack? Whose <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> would he not seek to break down? Seeing that, as has been shown in the reading of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> , he did not restrain his wiles even against the Saviour of the world Himself. For being exceedingly afraid of His fast, which lasted 40 days and nights, he wished most cunningly to discover whether this power of abstinence was given Him or His very own: for he need not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the defeat of all his treacherous designs, if Christ were throughout subject to the same conditions as He is in body.  And so he first craftily examined whether He were Himself the Creator of all things, such that He could change the natures of material things as He pleased: secondly, whether under the form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh the Godhead lay concealed, to Whom it was easy to make the air His chariot, and convey His earthly limbs through space. But when the Lord preferred to resist him by the uprightness of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Manhood, than to display the power of His Godhead, to this he turns the craftiness of his third design, that he might tempt by the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of empire Him in Whom the signs of Divine power had failed, and entice Him to the worship of himself by promising the kingdoms of the world. But the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> cleverness was rendered foolish by God's wisdom, so that the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> foe was bound by that which he had formerly bound, and did not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to assail Him Whom it behooved to be slain for the world.</p>

<h2>IV. The perverse turn even their fasting into sin</h2>

<p>This adversary's wiles then let us beware of, not only in the enticements of the palate, but also in our purpose of abstinence. For he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to bring death upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> by means of food, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also how to harm us through our very <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and using the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> as his tools, as he once drove men to take what was forbidden, so in the opposite direction he prompts them to avoid what is allowed. It is indeed a helpful observance, which accustoms one to scanty diet, and checks the appetite for dainties: but woe to the dogmatizing of those whose very <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is turned to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For they condemn the creature's nature to the Creator's injury, and maintain that they are defiled by eating those things of which they contend the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the author: although absolutely nothing that exists is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, nor is anything in nature included in the actually bad. For the good Creator made all things good and the Maker of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is one, <q>Who made the heaven and the earth, the sea and all that is in them. </q> Of which whatever is granted to man for food and drink, is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and clean after its kind. But if it is taken with immoderate greed, it is the excess that disgraces the eaters and drinkers, not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the food or drink that defiles them. <q>For all things,</q> as the Apostle says, <q>are clean to the clean. But to the defiled and unbelieving nothing is clean, but their mind and <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is defiled <span class="stiki" id="note360929"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse15">Titus&nbsp;1:15</a></span> .</q></p>

<h2>V. Be reasonable and seasonable in your fasting</h2>

<p>But you, dearly-beloved, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> offspring of the catholic Mother, who have been taught in the school of Truth by God's Spirit, moderate your liberty with due reasonableness, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to abstain even from things lawful, and at seasons of greater strictness to distinguish one food from another with a view to giving up the use of some kinds, not to condemning their nature. And so be not infected with the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of those who are corrupted merely by their own ordinances, <q>serving the creature rather than the Creator <span class="stiki" id="note360930"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse26">Romans&nbsp;9:26</a></span>,</q> and offering a foolish abstinence to the service of the lights of heaven: seeing that they have chosen to fast on the first and second days of the week in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the sun and moon, proving themselves in this one instance of their perverseness twice disloyal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, twice <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a>, by setting up their fast not only in worship of the stars but also in contempt of the Lord's Resurrection. For they reject the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Christ our Lord in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> flesh of our nature was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> suffered, was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> buried and was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> raised. And in consequence, condemn the day of our rejoicing by the gloom of their <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. And since to conceal their infidelity they dare to be present at our meetings, at the Communion of the Mysteries  they bring themselves sometimes, in order to ensure their concealment, to receive Christ's Body with unworthy lips, though they altogether refuse to drink the Blood of our Redemption. And this we make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren, that men of this sort may be detected by you by these signs, and that they whose impious pretences have been discovered may be driven from the society of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> authority. For of such the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> in his foresight warns God's Church, saying: <q>but we beseech you, brethren, that you observe those who make discussions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you learned and turn away from them. For such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> serve not Christ the Lord but their own belly, and by sweet words and fair speeches beguile the hearts of the innocent <span class="stiki" id="note360932"><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;16:17-18</a></span> .</q></p>

<h2>VI. Make your fasting a reality by amendment in your lives</h2>

<p>Being therefore, dearly-beloved, fully instructed by these admonitions of ours, which we have often repeated in your ears in protest against abominable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, enter upon the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> days of Lent with Godly devoutness, and prepare yourselves to win God's mercy by your own works of mercy. Quench your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, wipe out enmities, cherish unity, and vie with one another in the offices of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> humility. Rule your slaves and those who are put under you with fairness, let none of them be tortured by imprisonment or chains. Forego vengeance, forgive offenses: exchange severity for gentleness, indignation for meekness, discord for peace. Let all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> find us self-restrained, peaceable, kind: that our <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> may be acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For in a word to Him we offer the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> abstinence and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godliness, when we keep ourselves from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> helping us through all, to Whom with the Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> belongs one Godhead and one Majesty, for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
