<h1>Sermon 42 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[XCII. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the same words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse42">Matthew 22:42</a></p>

<p>1. The question which was proposed to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> ought to solve. For the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who proposed it to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, did not solve it Himself, to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, I mean, He did not, but to us He has solved it. I will put you in remembrance, Beloved, and you will find that He has solved it. But first consider the knot of the question. He asked the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> what they <q>thought of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whose Son He was to be;</q> for they too look for the Christ. They read of Him in the Prophets, they expected Him to come, when He had come they killed Him; for where they read that Christ would come, there did they read that they should kill Christ. But His future coming they hoped for in the Prophets; for they did not see their future crime. He therefore so questioned them about the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, not as if about One who was unknown to them, or whose Name they had never heard, or whose coming they had never hoped for. For they <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in that even yet they hope for Him. And we indeed hope for Him too; but we hope for Him as One who is to come as Judge, not to be judged. For the Holy Prophets prophesied both, that He should come first to be judged unrighteously, that He should come afterwards to judge with righteousness. <q>What think ye,</q> then, says he, <q>of Christ? Whose Son is He? They answered Him, The Son of David.</q>  And this was entirely according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. But He said, <q>How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto My Lord, Sit on My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool. If David then in spirit call Him Lord, how is He his Son?</q> </p>

<p>2. Here then is need of a caution, lest Christ be thought to have denied that He was the Son of David. He did not deny that He was the Son of David, but He enquired the way. <q>You have said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Son of David, I do not deny it; but David calls Him Lord; tell me how is He his Son, who is also his Lord; tell me how?</q> They did not tell Him, but were silent. Let us then tell by the explanation of Christ Himself. Where? By His Apostle. But first, whereby do we prove that Christ has Himself explained it? The Apostle says, <q>Would ye receive a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of Christ who speaks in me?</q>  So then in the Apostle has He vouchsafed to solve this question. In the first place, what said Christ speaking by the Apostle to Timothy? <q>Remember that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was raised from the dead according to my <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</q>  See, Christ is the Son of David. How is He also David's Lord? Tell us, O Apostle: <q>who being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Acknowledge David's Lord. If you acknowledge David's Lord, our Lord, the Lord of heaven and earth, the Lord of the Angels, equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how is He David's Son? Mark what follows. The Apostle shows you David's Lord by saying, <q>Who being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And how is He David's Son? <q>But He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He humbled Himself, having become <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also has highly exalted Him.</q>  Christ <q>of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>,</q> the Son of David, rose again because <q>He emptied Himself.</q> How did He <q>empty Himself</q>? By taking that which He was not, not by losing that which He was. He <q>emptied Himself,</q> He <q>humbled himself.</q> Though He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He appeared as man. He was despised as He walked on earth, He who made the heaven. He was despised as though a mere man, as though of no power. Yea, not despised only, but slain moreover. He was that stone that lay on the ground, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> stumbled against it, and were shaken. And what does He Himself say? <q>Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be shaken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.</q>  First, He lay low, and they stumbled against Him; He shall come from above, and He will <q>grind</q> them that have been shaken <q>to powder.</q></p>

<p>3. Thus have ye heard that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is both David's Son, and David's Lord: David's Lord always, David's Son in time: David's Lord, born of the substance of His Father, David's Son, born of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, conceived by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Let us hold fast both. The one of them will be our <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> habitation, the other is our deliverance from our present exile. For unless <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> had vouchsafed to become man, man had perished. He was made that which He made, that what He made might not perish. Very Man, Very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> whole Christ. This is the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Whoso denies that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is God is a Photinian;  whoso denies that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is man is a <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a>.  Whoso confesses that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is God equal with the Father and very man, that He <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> suffered, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> shed His blood (for the Truth would not have set us free, if He had given a false price for us); whoso confesses both, is a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. He has the country, he has the way. He has the country, <q>In the beginning was the Word;</q>  He has the country, <q>Being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  He has the way, <q>The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>;</q>  He has the way, <q>He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant.</q>  He is the home whither we are going, He is the way whereby we go. Let us by Him go unto Him, and we shall not go astray.</p>
