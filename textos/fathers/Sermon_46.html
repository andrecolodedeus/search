<h1>Sermon 46</h1>

<p> <em>On Lent, VIII.</em></p>

<h2>I. Lent must be kept not only by avoiding bodily impurity but also by avoiding errors of thought and faith</h2>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> indeed, dearly-beloved, your devotion to be so warm that in the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, which is the forerunner of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, many of you will have forestalled our exhortations. But because the right practice of abstinence is needful not only to the mortification of the flesh but also to the purification of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, we desire your observance to be so complete that, as you cut down the pleasures that belong to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the flesh, so you should banish the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> that proceed from the imaginations of the heart. For he whose heart is polluted with no misbelief prepares himself with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and reasonable purification for the Paschal Feast, in which all the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of our religion meet together. For, as the Apostle says, that <q>all that is not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360933"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;14:23</a></span>,</q> the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> of those will be unprofitable and vain, whom the father of lying deceives with his delusions, and who are not fed by Christ's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> flesh. As then we must with the whole heart <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the Divine commands and sound doctrine, so we must use all foresight in abstaining from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> imaginations. For the mind then only keeps <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and spiritual fast when it rejects the food of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and the poison of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, which our crafty and wily foe plies us with more treacherously now, when by the very return of the venerable Festival, the whole church generally is admonished to understand the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of its <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For he is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> confessor and worshipper of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> resurrection, who is not confused about His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, nor deceived about His bodily nativity. For some are so ashamed of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the Cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as to impudently nullify the punishment which He underwent for the world's redemption, and have denied the very nature of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> flesh in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, not understanding how the impassible and unchangeable Deity of God's Word could have so far condescended for man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as by His power not to lose His own properties, and in His mercy to take on Him ours. And so in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, there is a twofold form but one person, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who is at the same time <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, is one Lord, accepting the condition of a slave by the design of loving-kindness, not by the law of necessity, because by His power He became <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, by His power passible, by His power mortal; that for the destruction of the tyranny of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death, the weak nature in Him might be capable of punishment, and the strong nature not lose anything of its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<h2>II. All the actions of Christ reveal the presence of the twofold nature</h2>

<p>And so, dearly-beloved, when in reading or hearing the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> you find certain things in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> subjected to injuries and certain things illumined by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, in such a way that in the same Person now the Humanity appears, and now the Divinity shines out, do not put down any of these things to a delusion, as if in Christ there is either Manhood alone or Godhead alone, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> both faithfully, worship both right humbly; so that in the union of the Word and the Flesh there may be no separation, and the bodily <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> may not seem delusive, because the divine signs were evident in Jesus. The attestations to both natures in Him are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and abundant, and by the depth of the Divine purpose all concur to this end, that the inviolable Word not being separated from the passible flesh, the Godhead may be understood as in all things partaker with the flesh and flesh with the Godhead. And, therefore, must the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mind that would eschew lies and be the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, use the Gospel-story confidently, and, as if still in company with the Apostles themselves, distinguish what is visibly done by the Lord, now by the spiritual understanding and now by the bodily organs of sight. Assign to the man that He is born a boy of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: assign to God that His mother's <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is not harmed, either by conception or by bearing. Recognize <q>the form of a slave</q> enwrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>, but acknowledge that it was the Lord's form that was announced by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, <q>proclaimed by the elements ,</q> adored by the wise men. Understand it of His humanity that he did not avoid the marriage feast: confess it Divine that he turned water into wine. Let your own feelings explain to you why He shed tears over a dead friend: let His Divine power be realized, when that same friend, after mouldering in the grave four days, is brought to life and raised only by the command of His voice. To make clay with spittle and earth was a work of the body: but to anoint therewith and enlighten the eyes of the blind is an undoubted mark of that power which had reserved for the revelation of its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that which it had not allowed to the early part of His natural life. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> to relieve bodily fatigue with rest in sleep: but it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Divine to quell the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of raging storms by a rebuking command. To set food before the hungry denotes <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> kindness and a philanthropic spirit: but with five loaves and two fishes to satisfy 5,000 men, besides <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children, who would dare deny that to be the work of Deity? A Deity which, by the co-operation of the functions of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> flesh, showed not only itself in Manhood, but also Manhood in itself; for the old, original wounds in man's nature could not be healed, except by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> taking to Himself flesh from the Virgin's womb, whereby in one and the same Person flesh and the Word co-existed.</p>

<h2>III. Hold fast to the statements of the Creed</h2>

<p>This belief in the Lord's Incarnation, dearly-beloved, through which the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is Christ's body , hold firm with heart unshaken and abstain from all the lies of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and remember that your works of mercy will only then profit you, and your strict continence only then bear fruit, when your minds are unsoiled by any defilement from wrong opinions. Cast away the arguments of this world's wisdom, for God <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> them, and none can arrive by them at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Truth, and keep fixed in your mind that which you say in the Creed. Believe  the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to be co-eternal with the Father by Whom all things were made and without Whom nothing was made, born also according to the flesh at the end of the times. Believe Him to have been in the body crucified, dead, raised up, and lifted above the heights of heavenly powers, set on the Father's right hand, about to come in the same flesh in which He ascended, to judge the living and the dead. For this is what the Apostle proclaims to all the faithful, saying: <q>if you be risen with Christ seek the things which are above, where Christ is sitting on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth. For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For when Christ, our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with Him in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360937"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse1">Colossians&nbsp;3:1-4</a></span> .</q></p>

<h2>IV. Use Lent for general improvement in the whole round of Christian duties</h2>

<p>Relying, therefore, dearly-beloved, on so great a promise, be heavenly not only in hope, but also in conduct. And though our minds must at all times be set on <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of mind and body, yet now during these 40 days of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> bestir yourselves  to yet more active works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, not only in the distribution of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, which are very effectual in attesting reform, but also in forgiving offenses, and in being merciful to those accused of wrongdoing, that the condition which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has laid down between Himself and us may not be against us when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. For when we say, in accordance with the Lord's teaching, <q>Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors <span class="stiki" id="note360939"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span>,</q> we ought with the whole heart to carry out what we say. For then only will what we ask in the next clause come to pass, that we be not led into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> and freed from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> : through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, Who with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> lives and reigns for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
