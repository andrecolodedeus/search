<h1>Sermon 49</h1>

<p> <em>On Lent, XI.</em></p>

<h2>I. The Lenten fast is incumbent on all alike</h2>

<p>On all days and seasons, indeed, dearly-beloved, some marks of the Divine goodness are set, and no part of the year is destitute of sacred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, in order that, so long as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> meet us on all sides, we may the more eagerly accept the never-ceasing calls of God's mercy. But all that is bestowed on the restoration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the various works and gifts of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is put before us more clearly and abundantly now, when no isolated portions of the Faith are to be celebrated, but the whole together. For as the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> festival approaches, the greatest and most binding of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> is kept, and its observance is imposed on all the faithful without exception; because no one is so <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> that he ought not to be holier, nor so devout that he might not be devouter. For who, that is set in the uncertainty of this life, can be found either exempt from <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, or free from fault? Who is there who would not wish for additions to his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or removal of his <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>? Seeing that adversity does us harm, and prosperity spoils us, and it is equally dangerous not to have what we want at all, and to have it in the fullest measure. There is a trap in the fullness of riches, a trap in the straits of poverty. The one lifts us up in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, the other incites us to complaint. Health tries us, sickness tries us, so long as the one fosters carelessness and the other sadness. There is a snare in security, a snare in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; and it matters not whether the mind which is given over to earthly thoughts, is taken up with pleasures or with cares; for it is equally unhealthy to languish under empty delights, or to labour under racking anxiety.</p>

<h2>II. The broad road is crowded, the narrow way of salvation nearly empty</h2>

<p>And thus is perfectly fulfilled that assurance of the Truth, by which we learn that <q>narrow and steep is the way that leads to life <span class="stiki" id="note360941"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;7:14</a></span>;</q> and while the breadth of the way that leads to death is crowded with a large company, the steps are few of those that tread the path of safety. And wherefore is the left road more thronged than the right, save that the multitude is prone to worldly joys and carnal goods? And although that which it desires is short-lived and uncertain, yet men endure toil more willingly for the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of pleasure than for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Thus while those who crave things visible are unnumbered, those who prefer the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> to the temporal are hardly to be found. And, therefore, seeing that the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says, <q>the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360942"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:18</a></span>,</q> the path of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> lies hid and in concealment, to a certain extent, since <q>by hope we were saved <span class="stiki" id="note360943"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;8:24</a></span>,</q> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> loves that above all things, which it attains to without any intervention of the flesh. A great work and toil it is then to keep our wayward heart from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and, with the numberless allurements of pleasure to ensnare it on all sides, not to let the vigour of the mind give way to any attack. Who <q>touches pitch, and is not defiled thereby <span class="stiki" id="note360944"><a href="../bible/sir013.htm#verse1">Sirach&nbsp;13:1</a></span>?</q> who is not weakened by the flesh? Who is not begrimed by the dust? Who, lastly, is of such purity as not to be polluted by those things without which one cannot live? For the Divine teaching commands by the Apostle's mouth that <q>they who have wives</q> should <q>be as though they had none: and those that weep as though they wept not; and those that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy as though they possessed not; and those that use this world as though they used it not; for the fashion of this world passes away. </q> Blessed, therefore, is the mind that passes the time of its pilgrimage in chaste sobriety, and loiters not in the things through which it has to walk, so that, as a stranger rather than the possessor of its earthly abode, it may not be wanting in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affections, and yet rest on the Divine promises.</p>

<h2>III. Satan is incited to fresh efforts at this season of the year</h2>

<p>And, dearly-beloved, no season requires and bestows this <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> more than the present, when by the observance of a special strictness a habit is acquired which must be persevered in. For it is well known to you that this is the time when throughout the world the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> waxes <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> army has to combat him, and any that have grown lukewarm and <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a>, or that are absorbed in worldly cares, must now be furnished with spiritual armour and their ardour kindled for the fray by the heavenly trumpet, inasmuch as he, through whose <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> death came into the world <span class="stiki" id="note360946"><a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse24">Wisdom&nbsp;2:24</a></span>, is now consumed with the strongest jealousy and now tortured with the greatest vexation. For he sees  whole tribes of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> brought in afresh to the adoption of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'s sons and the offspring of the New Birth multiplied through the virgin fertility of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He sees himself <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> of all his tyrannic power, and driven from the hearts of those he once possessed, while from either sex thousands of the old, the young, the middle-aged are snatched away from him, and no one is debarred by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> either of his own or original, where justification is not paid for deserts, but simply given as a free gift. He sees, too, those that have lapsed, and have been deceived by his treacherous snares, washed in the tears of penitence and, by the Apostle's key unlocking the gates of mercy, admitted to the benefit of reconciliation.  He feels, moreover, that the day of the Lord's Passion is at hand, and that he is crushed by the power of that cross which in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who was free from all debt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, was the world's ransom and not the penalty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>IV. Self-examination by the standard of God's commands the right occupation in Lent</h2>

<p>And so, that the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the fretting foe may effect nothing by its rage, a keener devotion must be awaked to the performance of the Divine commands, in order that we may enter on the season, when all the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the Divine mercy meet together, with preparedness both of mind and body, invoking the guidance and help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we may be strong to fulfil all things through Him, without Whom we can do nothing. For the injunction is laid on us, in order that we may seek the aid of Him Who lays it. Nor must any one excuse himself by reason of his weakness, since He Who has granted the will, also gives the power, as the blessed Apostle James says, <q>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who gives to all liberally and upbraids not, and it shall be given him <span class="stiki" id="note360949"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse5">James&nbsp;1:5</a></span> .</q> Which of the faithful does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> he ought to cultivate, and what <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> to fight against? Who is so partial or so unskilled a judge of his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> as not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what ought to be removed, and what ought to be developed? Surely no one is so devoid of reason as not to understand the character of his mode of life, or not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the secrets of his heart. Let him not then please himself in everything, nor judge himself according to the delights of the flesh, but place his every habit in the scale of the Divine commands, where, some things being ordered to be done and others forbidden, he can examine himself in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> balance by weighing the actions of his life according to this standard. For the designing mercy of God  has set up the brightest mirror in His commandments, wherein a man may see his mind's face and realize its conformity or dissimilarity to God's image: with the specific purpose that, at least, during the days of our Redemption and Restoration, we may throw off awhile our carnal cares and restless occupations, and betake ourselves from earthly matters to heavenly.</p>

<h2>V. Forgiveness of our own sins requires that we should forgive others</h2>

<p>But because, as it is written, <q>in many things we all stumble <span class="stiki" id="note360951"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse2">James&nbsp;3:2</a></span>,</q> let the feeling of mercy be first aroused and the faults of others against us be forgotten; that we may not violate by any <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of revenge that most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> compact, to which we bind ourselves in the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a>, and when we say <q>forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors,</q> let us not be hard in forgiving, because we must be possessed either with the desire for revenge, or with the leniency of gentleness, and for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is ever exposed to the dangers of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, it is more to be desired that his own faults should not need punishment  than that he should get the faults of others punished. And what is more suitable to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> than that not only in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but also in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> homes, there should be forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? Let threats be laid aside; let bonds be loosed, for he who will not loose them will bind himself with them much more disastrously. For whatsoever one man resolves upon against another, he decrees against himself by his own terms. Whereas <q>blessed are the merciful, for God shall have mercy on them :</q> and He is just and kind in His judgments, allowing some to be in the power of others to this end, that under fair government may be preserved both the profitableness of discipline and the kindliness of clemency, and that no one should dare to refuse that pardon to another's shortcomings, which he wishes to receive for his own.</p>

<h2>VI. Reconciliation between enemies and almsgiving are also Lenten duties</h2>

<p>Furthermore, as the Lord says, that <q>the peacemakers are blessed, because they shall be called sons of God <span class="stiki" id="note360954"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;5:9</a></span>,</q> let all discords and enmities be laid aside, and let no one think to have a share in the Paschal feast that has neglected to restore brotherly peace. For with the Father on high, he that is not in charity with the brethren, will not be reckoned in the number of His sons. Furthermore, in the distribution of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> and care of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, let our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> fast-times be fat and abound; and let each bestow on the weak and destitute those dainties which he denies himself. Let pains be taken that all may bless God with one mouth, and let him that gives some portion of substance understand that he is a minister of the Divine mercy; for God has placed the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the poor in the hand of the liberal man; that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are washed away either by the waters of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or the tears of repentance, may be also blotted out by <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>; for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>As water extinguishes fire, so <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> extinguishes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360955"><a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse30">Sirach&nbsp;3:30</a></span> .</q> Through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, etc.</p>
