<h1>Sermon 49 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[XCIX. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse37">Luke 7:37</a> <em>, <q>And behold, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was in the city, a sinner,</q> etc. On the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, against the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>.</em></p>

<p>1. Since I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that it is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that I should speak to you on the subject whereof we are now reminded by the words of the Lord out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, I will by His assistance deliver to you, Beloved, a Sermon touching the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For when the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was being read, you gave most earnest heed, and the story was reported, and represented before the eyes of your heart. For you saw, not with the body, but with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> <q>sitting at meat in the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee's</a> house,</q>  and when invited by him, not disdaining to go. You saw too a <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a></q> famous in the city, famous indeed in ill fame, <q>who was a sinner,</q> without invitation force her way into the feast, where her Physician was at meat, and with an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> shamelessness seek for health. She forced her way then, as it were unseasonably as regarded the feast, but seasonably as regarded her expected blessing; for she well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> under how severe a disease she was labouring, and she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He to whom she had come was able to make her whole; she approached then, not to the Head of the Lord, but to His Feet; and she who had walked long in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, sought now the steps of Uprightness. First she shed tears, the heart's blood; and washed the Lord's Feet with the duty of confession. She wiped them with her hair, she kissed, she anointed them: she spoke by her silence; she uttered not a word, but she manifested her devotion.</p>

<p>2. So then because she touched the Lord, in watering, kissing, washing, anointing His feet; the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> who had invited the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, seeing He was of that kind of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> men of whom the Prophet Isaiah says, <q>Who say, Depart far from me, touch me not, for I am clean;</q>  thought that the Lord did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. This he was thinking with himself, and saying in his heart, <q>This man if He were a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> this is that</q> has approached His feet. He supposed that He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> her, because He repelled her not, because He did not forbid her to approach Him, because He suffered Himself to be touched by her, sinner as she was. For whence <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> he, that He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> her? But what if He did <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O you <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, inviter and yet derider of the Lord! Thou dost feed the Lord, yet by whom you are to be fed yourself, you do not understand. Whereby do you know, that the Lord did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> had been, save because she was permitted to approach Him, save because by His sufferance she kissed His Feet, save because she washed, save because she anointed them? For these things a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> unclean ought not to be permitted to do with the Feet that are clean? So then had such a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> approached that <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee's</a> feet, he would have been sure to say what Isaiah says of such; <q>Depart from me, touch me not, for I am clean.</q> But she approached the Lord in her uncleanness, that she might return clean: she approached sick, that she might return whole: she approached Him, confessing, that she might return professing Him.</p>

<p>3. For the Lord heard the thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>. Let now the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> understand even by this, whether He was not able to see her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, who could hear his thoughts. So then He put forth to the man a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> concerning two men, who owed to the same creditor. For He was desirous to heal the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> also, that He might not eat bread at his house for nought; He hungered after him who was feeding Him, He wished to reform him, to slay, to eat him, to pass him over into His Own Body; just as to that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, He said, <q>I thirst.</q> What is, <q>I thirst</q>? I long for your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore are the words of the Lord in this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>  spoken; and there is this double object in them, both that that inviter might be cured together with those who ate at the table with Him, who alike saw the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and were alike <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Him, and that that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> might have the assurance her confession merited, and not be pricked any more with the stings of her <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. <q>One,</q> said He, <q>owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty; He forgave them both: which loved him most?</q> He to whom the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> was proposed answered, what of course common reason <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to answer. <q>I suppose, Lord, he to whom he forgave most. Then turning to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> he said unto Simon, Do you see this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? I entered into your house, you gave Me no water for My feet: she has washed My feet with tears, and wiped them with her hairs. You gave Me no <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>: this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> since the time she came in, has not ceased to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> My feet. My head with oil you did not anoint: but this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has anointed My feet with ointment. Therefore I say, her many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven her, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.</q> </p>

<p>4. Here arises a difficulty which must in real <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be resolved, and which requires your fixed attention, Beloved, lest haply my words may not be equal to the removing and clearing of the whole obscurity of it by reason of the stress of time; especially as this flesh of mine exhausted by its heat, now longs to be recruited, and demanding its due, and clogging the eagerness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> gives <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of that which is said, <q>The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</q>  Cause there is for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, yea great <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, lest by these words of the Lord, there steal over the minds of those who understand them not aright, who indulge their fleshly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and are loth to be brought away from them into liberty, that sentiment which, even as the Apostles preached, sprung up in the tongues of <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> men, of whom the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says, <q>And as some affirm that we say, Let us do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that good may come.</q>  For a man may say, <q>If 'he to whom little is forgiven, loves little;' and he to whom more is forgiven, loves more; and it is better to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> more, than to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> less; it is right that we should <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> much, and owe much which we may desire to be forgiven us, that so we may <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him the more who forgives us our large debts. For that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> who was a sinner, in the same proportion as she owed more, loved the more Him who forgave her her debts, as the Lord Himself says, 'Her many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven her, for she loved much.' Now why did she <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> much, but because she owed much? And afterwards He added and subjoined, 'But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.' Is it not better,</q> he may say, <q>that much should be forgiven me, than less, that thereupon I may <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> my Lord the more</q>? You see no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the great depth of this difficulty; ye see it, I am sure. You see too my stress of time; yes, this also do ye see and feel.</p>

<p>5. Accept then a few words. If I shall not do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the magnitude of the question, lay up for a time  what I shall say at present, and hold me a debtor for some future time. Suppose now two men, that by the clearer force of examples ye may think upon what I have proposed to you. One of them is full of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, has lived most wickedly for a length of time; the other of them has committed but few <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; they come both to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, are both <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, they enter debtors, they go out free; more has been forgiven to one, less to the other. I ask, how much does each <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? If I shall find that he loves most, to whom the most <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have been forgiven, it is to his greater advantage that he has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> much, his much iniquity was to his greater advantage, that so his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> might not be lukewarm. I ask the other how much he loves, I find less; for if I find that he too loves, as much as the other, to whom much has been forgiven, how shall I make answer to the words of the Lord, how shall that be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which the Truth has said, <q>To whom little is forgiven, the same loves little</q>? <q>See,</q> a man says, <q>but little has been forgiven me, I have not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> much; yet I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> as much as he, to whom much has been forgiven.</q> Do you speak <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or Christ? Has your lie been forgiven you to this end, that you should fix the charge of lying on Him who forgave you? If little has been forgiven you, you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> little. For if but little has been forgiven you, and you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> very much, you contradict Him who said, <q>To whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.</q> Therefore I give the more credit to Him, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> you better than you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> yourself. If you suppose that but little has been forgiven you, it is certain that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> but little. <q>What then,</q> says he, <q>ought I to do? Ought I to commit many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that there may be many which He shall be able to forgive me, that I may be able to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> more?</q> It presses me sore, but may the Lord, who has proposed this saying of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to us, deliver me out of this strait.</p>

<p>6. This was spoken on account of that <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> who thought that he had either no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or but few. Now unless he had had some <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, he would not have invited the Lord. But how little was it! He gave Him no <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, not so much as water for His Feet, much less tears; he did not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> Him with any of those offices of respect, with which that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> did, who well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what need she had of being cured, and by whom she might be cured. O <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, therefore do you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> but little, because you fondly think that but little is forgiven you; not because little really is forgiven you, but because you think that that which is forgiven is but little. <q>What then?</q> he says; <q>Am I who have never committed <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, to be reckoned a murderer? Am I who have never been guilty of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, to be punished for <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>? Or are these things to be forgiven me, which I have never committed?</q> See: once more suppose two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and let us speak to them. One comes with supplication, a sinner covered over with thorns as a hedgehog, and timid exceedingly as a hare. But the rock is the hedgehog's and the hare's refuge.  He comes then to the Rock, he finds refuge, he receives succour. The other has not committed many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; what shall we do for him that he may <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> much? What shall we persuade him? Shall we go against the words of the Lord, <q>To whom little is forgiven, the same loves little</q>? Yes, most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> so, to whom little is really forgiven. But O you who says that you have not committed many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: why have you not? By whose guidance? God be thanked, that by your movement and voice you have made signs that you have understood me. Now then, as I think, the difficulty has been solved. The one has committed many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and so is made a debtor for many; the other through God's guidance has committed but few. To Him to whom the one ascribes what He has forgiven, does the other also ascribe what he has not committed. You have not been an adulterer in that past life of yours, which was full of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, when as yet you were not enlightened, as yet discerned not good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not on Him, who was guiding you though you did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. Thus does your God speak to you: <q>I was guiding you for Myself, I was keeping you for Myself. That you might not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, no enticers were near you; that no enticers were near you, was My doing. Place and time were wanting; that they were wanting again, was My doing. Or enticers were near you, and neither place nor time was wanting; that you might not consent, it was I who alarmed you. Acknowledge then His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to whom you also owe it, that you have not committed the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The other owes me what was done, and you have seen forgiven him; and you owe to me what you have not done.</q> For there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which one man commits, which another man may not commit also, if He be wanting as a Director, by whom man was made.</p>

<p>7. Now then seeing I have resolved this profound difficulty, as best I could in so short a space of time (or if I have not resolved it yet, let me be held, as I have already said, a debtor for the rest); let us now rather consider briefly that question of the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Christ was supposed to be but a man both by him who invited Him, and by them who sat as guests at the table with Him. But that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was a sinner had seen something more than this in the Lord. For why did she all those things, but that her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> might be forgiven her? She <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> then that He was able to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that no man was able to forgive them. And we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they all, they who were at the table, that is, and that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who approached to the Feet of the Lord, all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that no man could forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Forasmuch then as they all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this; she who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that He could forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, understood Him to be more than man. So when He had said to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you;</q> they immediately said, <q>Who is this that forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> also?</q> Who is this, whom the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was a sinner already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>? Thou who sittest at the table as if in sound health, <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> not your Physician; because it may be through a stronger fever you have even lost your reason. For thus the frantic patient as he laughs is bewailed by those who are in health. Nevertheless, you do well to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and hold fast that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; yea, hold it fast, that no man is able to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. This <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that she could be forgiven by Christ, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Christ not to be man only, but God also. <q>Who,</q> say they, <q>is this that forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> also?</q> And the Lord did not tell them as they said, <q>Who is this?</q> <q>It is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>;</q> He did not tell them this, but suffering them to abide for a while still in their former opinion, He really solved the question which had excited them. For He who saw them at the table, heard their thoughts, and turning to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, He said, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has made you whole.</q> Let these who say, <q>Who is this that forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> also?</q> who think me to be but a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, think me but a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For you <q>your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has made you whole.</q></p>

<p>8. The Good Physician not only cured the sick then present, but provided also for them who were to be hereafter. There were to be men in after times, who should say, <q>It is I  who forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, I who justify, I who sanctify, I who cure whomsoever I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>.</q> Of this number are they who say, <q>Touch me not.</q>  Yes, so thoroughly are they of this number, that lately, in our conference,  as you may read in the records of it, when a place was offered them by the commissary,  that they should sit with us, they thought it right to answer, <q>It is told us in Scripture with such not to sit,</q> lest of course by the contact of the seats, our contagion (as they think) should reach to them. See if this is not, <q>Touch me not, for I am clean.</q> But on another day, when I had a better opportunity, I represented to them this most wretched vanity, when there was a question concerning the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, how that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in it do not contaminate the good: I answered them, because they would not on this account sit with us, and said that they had been so advised by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeing forsooth that it is written, <q>I have not sat in the council of vanity;</q>  I said, <q>If you will not sit with us, because it is written, 'I have not sat in the council of vanity;' why have ye entered this place with us, since it is written in the following words, 'And with them that do iniquity I will not enter in'?</q> So then in that they say, <q>Touch me not, for I am clean,</q> they are like to that <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, who had invited the Lord, and who thought that He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, simply because He did not hinder her from touching His Feet. But in another respect the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> was better, because whereas he supposed Christ to be but a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that by a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> could be forgiven. There was shown then a better understanding in <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> than <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. What said the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? <q>'Who is this that forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> also?' Does any man dare to usurp this to himself?</q> What on the other hand says the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>? <q>It is I who forgive, I cleanse, I sanctify.</q> Let not me, but Christ, answer him: O man, when I was thought by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to be but a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, I gave forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. (It is not I, but Christ who answers you.) And you, O <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, mere man as you are, dost say, <q>Come, O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, I will make you whole.</q> Whereas when I was thought to be but a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, I said, <q>Go, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has made you whole.</q></p>

<p>9. They answer, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> not,</q> as the Apostle says, <q>either what they speak, or whereof they affirm:</q>  they answer and say, <q>If men do not forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, then that is false which Christ says, 'Whatsoever you shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven also.'</q>  But you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> why this is said, and in what sense this is said. The Lord was about to give to men the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and He wished it to be understood that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven to His faithful by His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and not by men's deserts. For what are you, O man, but an invalid who hast need of healing. Would you make yourself my physician? Together with me, seek the Physician. For that the Lord might show this more plainly, that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which He has given to His faithful ones, and not by men's deserts, after He had risen from the dead, He says in a certain place, <q>Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>;</q>  and when He had said, <q>Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> He subjoined immediately, <q>Whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye remit, they are remitted unto them;</q>  that is, the Spirit remits them, not ye. Now the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. God therefore remits, not ye. But what are you in regard to the Spirit? <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwells in you?</q>  And again, <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your bodies are the temples of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which is in you, which you have of God?</q>  So then God dwells in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple, that is in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> faithful ones, in His Church; by them does He remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; because they are living temples.</p>

<p>10. But He who remits by man, can also remit even without man. For He who is able to give by another, has no less the power to give by Himself. To some He gave by the ministry of John. By whom did He give to John himself? With good reason, as God wished to show this, and to attest this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when certain in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> had had the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> preached to them,  and had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Philip the Evangelist, one of the seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> that were first chosen, they did not receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, though they had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Tidings were brought to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who were at Jerusalem, and they came to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>,  in order that they who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, might by imposition of their hands receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And so it was; <q>They came and laid their hands on them, and they received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q>  For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was at that time given in such sort, that He even visibly showed Himself to have been given. For they who received Him spoke with the tongues of all nations; to signify that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> among the nations was to speak in the tongues of all. So then they received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and He appeared evidently to be in them. Which when Simon saw, supposing that this power was of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, he wished it might be his also. What he thought to be of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, he wished to buy of men. <q>How much money,</q> says he, <q>will you take of me, that by imposition of my hands the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> may be given?</q> Then Peter says to him with execration, You have neither part nor lot in this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. Your money perish with you;  and the rest which he spoke in the same place suitably to the occasion.</p>

<p>11. Now why I have wished to bring this subject before you, give heed, Dearly Beloved. It was meet that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should first show that He works by the ministry of men; but afterwards by Himself, lest men should think, as Simon thought, that it was man's gift, and not God's. Though the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> themselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this well already. For there were one hundred and twenty  men collected together, when without the imposition of any hand the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came upon them. For who had laid hands on them at that time? And yet He came, and filled them first. After that offense of Simon, what did God do? See Him teaching, not by words but by things. That same Philip, who had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the men, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> had not come upon them, unless the Apostles had met together and laid their hands upon them, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the officer, that is, the eunuch of queen Candace, who had worshipped in Jerusalem, and returning thence was reading in his chariot Isaiah the Prophet,  and understood it not. Philip being admonished went up to his chariot, explained the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, unfolded the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, preached Christ.  The eunuch <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Christ, and said when they came unto a certain water, <q>See water, who does hinder me to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? Philip said to him, Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>? He answered, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Immediately he went down with him into the water.</q>  When the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> and sacrament of Baptism had been accomplished, that the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> might not be thought to be of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, there was no waiting, as in the other case, for the Apostles to come, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>  came immediately. Thus was Simon's thought destroyed, lest in such a thought he might have followers.</p> 

<p>12. Again, another more wonderful example. Peter came to Cornelius the centurion,  to a Gentile man, uncircumcised: he began to preach Christ Jesus both to him, and to those who were with him. <q>While Peter was yet speaking,</q>  I do not say, when as yet he had not laid on his hands, but when he had not even yet <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> them, and when they who were with Peter were in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether the uncircumcised ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> (for there had arisen an offense between the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and those who had been brought to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, between the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that is, and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> though uncircumcised), that God might take away this question, <q>while Peter was speaking, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came,</q> filled Cornelius, filled them who were with him. And by this very attestation of so great a thing, as it were a loud voice came to Peter, <q>Why do you <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of water? Already I am here.</q></p>

<p>13. So then let every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is to be delivered from her manifold <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord, to be cleansed as it were in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from her filthy prostitution, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> with all assurance, approach the Feet of the Lord, seek His Footsteps, confess in pouring out tears upon them, and wipe them with her hair. The Feet of the Lord are the preachers of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> hair is all superfluous possessions. Let her wipe the Feet with her hair, yea by all means wipe them, let her do works of mercy; and when she has wiped them, let her <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> them, let her receive peace, that she may have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. She has approached to such an one, has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by such an one as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>: from him let her hear, <q>Be followers of me, even as I also am of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q>  But she has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by another, by one <q>who seeks his own things, not the things which are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>'s:</q>  let her hear from the Lord, <q>Do what they say, but do not what they do.</q>  So let her assurance be in Him, whether she meet with a good Evangelist, or with one who acts not as he speaks. For she hears from the Lord with firm assurance, <q>O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, go your way, your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has made you whole.</q></p>
