<h1>Sermon 54</h1>

<p> <em>On the Passion, III.; delivered on the Sunday before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>.</em></p>

<h2>I. The two-fold nature of Christ set forth</h2>

<p>Among all the works of God's mercy, dearly-beloved, which from the beginning have been bestowed upon men's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, none is more wondrous, and none more sublime, than that Christ was crucified for the world. For to this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> all the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the ages preceding led up, and every variation which the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ordained in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, in prophetic signs, and in the observances of the Law, foretold that this was fixed, and promised its fulfilment: so that now types and figures are at an end, and we find our profit in believing that accomplished which before we found our profit in looking forward to. In all things, therefore, dearly-beloved, which pertain to the Passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith maintains and demands that we acknowledge the two Natures to have met in our Redeemer, and while their properties remained, such a union of both Natures to have been effected that, from the time when, as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> required, in the blessed Virgin's womb, <q>the Word became flesh,</q> we may not think of Him as God without that which is man, nor as man without that which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Each Nature does indeed express its real <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by actions that distinguish it, but neither separates itself from connection with the other. Nothing is wanting there on either side; in the majesty the humility is complete, in the humility the majesty is complete: and the unity does not introduce confusion, nor does the distinctiveness destroy the unity. The one is passible, the other inviolable; and yet the degradation belongs to the same Person, as does the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. He is present at once in weakness and in power; at once capable of death and the vanquisher of it. Therefore, God took on Him whole Manhood, and so blended the two Natures together by means of His mercy and power, that each Nature was present in the other, and neither passed out of its own properties into the other.</p>

<h2>II. The two natures acted conjointly, and the human sufferings were not compulsory, but in accordance with the Divine will</h2>

<p>But because the design of that <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which was ordained for our restoration before the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> ages, was not to be carried out without <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness and without Divine power , both <q>form</q> does that which is proper to it in common with the other, the Word, that is, performing that which is the Word's and the flesh that which is of the flesh. One of them gleams bright with <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, the other succumbs to injuries. The one departs not from equality with the Father's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the other leaves not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of our race. But nevertheless even His very endurance of sufferings does not so far expose Him to a participation in our humility as to separate Him from the power of the Godhead. All the mockery and insults, all the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and pain which the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> inflicted on the Lord, was not endured of necessity, but undertaken of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>: <q>for the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> came to seek and to save that which had perished <span class="stiki" id="note360974"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;19:10</a></span>:</q> and He used the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of His persecutors for the redemption of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in such a way that in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His Death and Resurrection even His murderers could have been saved, if they had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</p>

<h2>III. Judas' infamy has never been exceeded</h2>

<p>And hence, Judas, you are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> more criminal and unhappier than all; for when repentance should have called you back to the Lord, despair dragged you to the halter. You should have awaited the completion of your crime, and have put off your ghastly death by hanging, until Christ's Blood was shed for all sinners. And among the many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and gifts of the Lord's which might have aroused your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, at least, might have rescued you from your headlong fall, which at the Paschal supper you had received, being even then detected in your treachery by the sign of Divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Why do you distrust the goodness of Him, Who did not repel you from the communion of His body and blood, Who did not deny you the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of peace when you came with crowds and a band of armed men to seize Him. But O man that nothing could convert, O <q>spirit going and not returning ,</q> you followed your heart's rage, and, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> standing at your right hand, turned the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, which you had prepared against the life of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, to your own destruction, so that, because your crime had exceeded all measure of punishment, your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> might make you your own judge, your punishment allow you to be your own hangman.</p>

<h2>IV. Christ voluntarily bartered His glory for our weakness</h2>

<p>When, therefore, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself <span class="stiki" id="note360976"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:19</a></span>,</q> and the Creator Himself was wearing the creature which was to be restored to the image of its Creator; and after the Divinely-miraculous works had been performed, the performance of which the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> had once predicted, <q>then shall the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf shall hear; then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall be plain <span class="stiki" id="note360977"><a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;35:5-6</a></span>;</q> Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the time was now come for the fulfilment of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Passion, said, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sorrowful even unto death <span class="stiki" id="note360978"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;26:38-39</a></span>;</q> and again, <q>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me <span class="stiki" id="note360979"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;26:38-39</a></span> .</q> And these words, expressing a certain <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, show His desire to heal the affection of our weakness by sharing them, and to check our <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of enduring pain by undergoing it. In our Nature, therefore, the Lord trembled with our <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, that He might fully clothe our weakness and our frailty with the completeness of His own strength. For He had come into this world a rich and merciful Merchant from the skies, and by a wondrous exchange had entered into a bargain of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> with us, receiving ours and giving His, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for insults, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for pain, life for death: and He Whom more than 12,000 of the angel-hosts might have served  for the annihilation of His persecutors, preferred to entertain our fears, rather than employ His own power.</p>

<h2>V. St. Peter was the first to benefit by his Master's humiliation</h2>

<p>And how much this humiliation conferred upon all the faithful, the most blessed Apostle Peter was the first to prove, who, after the fierce blast of threatening cruelty had dismayed him, quickly changed, and was restored to vigour, finding remedy from the great Pattern, so that the suddenly-shaken member returned to the firmness of the Head. For the bond-servant could not be <q>greater than the Lord, nor the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> greater than the master ,</q> and he could not have vanquished the trembling of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty had not the Vanquisher of Death first feared. The Lord, therefore, <q>looked back upon Peter ,</q> and amid the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the falsehoods of witnesses, the injuries of those that scourged and spat upon Him, met His dismayed <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> with those eyes wherewith He had foreseen his dismay: and the gaze of the Truth entered into him, on whose heart correction must be wrought, as if the Lord's voice were making itself heard there, and saying, Where are you going, Peter? Why do you retire upon yourself? Turn to Me, put your trust in Me, follow Me: this is the time of My Passion, the hour of your suffering is not yet come. Why do you <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> what you, too, shall overcome? Let not the weakness, in which I share, confound you. I was fearful for you; be confident of Me.</p>

<h2>VI. The mad counsel of the Jews was turned to their own destruction</h2>

<p><q>And when morning had come all the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death <span class="stiki" id="note360983"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;27:1</a></span> .</q> This morning, O you <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, was for you not the rising, but the setting of the sun, nor did the wonted daylight visit your eyes, but a night of blackest darkness brooded on your naughty hearts. This morning overthrew for you the temple and its altars, did away with the Law and the Prophets, destroyed the Kingdom and the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, turned all your feasts into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> mourning. For you resolved on a mad and bloody counsel, you <q>fat bulls,</q> you <q>many oxen,</q> you <q>roaring</q> wild beasts, you rabid <q>dogs ,</q> to give up to death the Author of life and the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and, as if the enormity of your fury could be palliated by employing the verdict of him, who ruled your province, you lead Jesus bound to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> judgment, that the terror-stricken judge being overcome by your persistent shouts, you might choose a man that was a murderer for pardon, and demand the crucifixion of the Saviour of the world. After this condemnation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, brought about more by the cowardice than the power of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, who with washed hands but polluted mouth sent Jesus to the cross with the very lips that had pronounced Him innocent, the licence of the people, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the looks of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, heaped many insults on the Lord, and the frenzied mob wreaked its rage on Him, Who meekly and voluntarily endured it all. But because, dearly-beloved, the whole story is too long to go through today, let us put off the rest till Wednesday, when the reading of the Lord's Passion will be repeated.  For the Lord will grant to your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, that of His own free gift we may fulfil our promise: through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, Who lives and reigns for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
