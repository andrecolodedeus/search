<h1>Sermon 55</h1>

<p> <em>On the Lord's Passion IV., delivered on Wednesday in Holy Week.</em></p>

<h2>I. The difference between the penitence and blasphemy of the two robbers is a type of the human race</h2>

<p>That which we owe to your expectations, dearly-beloved, must be paid through the Lord's bountiful answer to your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that He Who has made you eager in the demanding would make us fit for the performing.</p>

<p>In speaking but lately of the Lord's Passion we reached the point in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> story, where <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> is said to have yielded to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews'</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shouts that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> should be crucified. And so when all things had been accomplished, which the Godhead veiled in frail flesh  permitted, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was fixed to the cross which He had also been carrying, two <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> being similarly crucified, one on His right hand, and the other on the left: so that even in the incidents of the cross might be displayed that difference which in His judgment must be made in the case of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; for the believing robber's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was a type of those who are to be saved, and the blasphemer's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> prefigured those who are to be damned. Christ's Passion, therefore, contains the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and of the instrument which the iniquity of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> prepared for His punishment, the Redeemer's power has made for us the stepping-stone to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> : and that Passion the Lord Jesus so underwent for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that, while hanging there nailed to the wood, He entreated the Father's mercy for His murderers, and said, <q>Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do <span class="stiki" id="note360988"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;23:34</a></span> .</q></p>

<h2>II. The chief priests showed utter ignorance of Scripture in their taunts</h2>

<p>But the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, for whom the Saviour sought forgiveness, rendered the torture of the cross yet worse by the barbs of railery; and at Him, on Whom they could vent no more fury with their hands, they hurled the weapons of their tongues, saying, <q>He saved others; Himself he cannot save. If He is the King of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, let Him now come down from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him <span class="stiki" id="note360989"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse42">Matthew&nbsp;27:42</a></span> .</q> From what spring of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, from what pool of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, O you <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, do you drink such poisonous <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>? What master informed you, what teaching convinced you that you ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to be King of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who should either not allow Himself to be crucified, or should shake Himself free from the binding nails. The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the Law, the sacred observances of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, the mouths of the Prophets never told you this: whereas you did find <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and oft-times written that which applies to your abominable wicked-doing and to the Lord's <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> suffering. For He Himself says by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, <q>I gave My back to the scourges, My cheeks to the palms of the hand, I turned not My face from the shame of spitting <span class="stiki" id="note360990"><a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;50:6</a></span> .</q> He Himself says by David, <q>They gave Me gall for My food, and in My thirst they supplied Me with vinegar ,</q> and again, <q>Many dogs came about Me, the council of evil-doers beset Me. They pierced My hands and My feet, they counted all My bones. But they themselves watched and gazed on Me, they parted My raiment among them, and for My robe they cast lots. </q> And lest the course of your own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doings should seem to have been foretold, and no power in the Crucified predicted, you read not, indeed, that the Lord descended from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, but you did read, <q>The Lord reigned on the tree. </q></p>

<h2>III. The triumph of the Cross is immediate and effective</h2>

<p>The Cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, therefore, symbolizes  the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> altar of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, on which the oblation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> nature should be celebrated by means of a salvation-bringing Victim. There the blood of the spotless Lamb blotted out the consequences of the ancient trespass: there the whole tyranny of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> was crushed, and humiliation triumphed <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> over the lifting up of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>: for so swift was the effect of Faith that of the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> crucified with Christ, the one who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Christ as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> entered paradise justified. Who can unfold the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of so great a boon? Who can state the power of so wondrous a change? In a moment of time the guilt of long evil-doing is done away; clinging to the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, amid the cruel tortures of his struggling <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he passes over to Christ; and to him, on whom his own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> had brought punishment, Christ's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> now gives a crown.</p>

<h2>IV. When the last act in the tragedy was over how must the Jews have felt?</h2>

<p>And then, having now tasted the vinegar, the produce of that vineyard which had degenerated in spite of its Divine Planter, and had turned to the sourness of a foreign vine , the Lord says, <q>it is finished;</q> that is, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are fulfilled: there is no more for Me to abide from the fury of the raging people: I have endured all that I foretold I should suffer. The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of weakness are completed, let the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of power be produced. And so He bowed the head and yielded up His Spirit and gave that Body, Which should be raised again on the third day, the rest of peaceful slumber. And when the Author of Life was undergoing this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> phase, and at so great a condescension of God's Majesty, the foundations of the whole world were shaken, when all creation condemned their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> crime by its upheaval, and the very elements of the world delivered a plain verdict against the criminals, what thoughts, what heart-searchings had you, O <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, when the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> went against you, and your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> could not be recalled, the crime having been done? What confusion covered you? What torment seized your hearts?</p>

<h2>V. Chastity and charity are the two things most needful in preparing for Easter Communion</h2>

<p>Seeing therefore, dearly-beloved, that God's Mercy is so great, that He has deigned to justify by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> many even from among such a nation, and had adopted into the company of the patriarchs and into the number of the chosen people us who were once perishing in the deep darkness of our old <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, let us mount to the summit of our hopes not sluggishly nor in sloth; but prudently and faithfully reflecting from what captivity and from how miserable a bondage, with what ransom we were purchased, by how strong an arm led out, let us glorify God in our body: that we may show Him dwelling in us, even by the uprightness of our manner of life. And because no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are worthier or more excellent than merciful loving-kindness and unblemished <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, let us more especially equip ourselves with these weapons, so that, raised from the earth, as it were on the two wings of active charity and shining purity, we may win a place in heaven. And whosoever, aided by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, is filled with this desire and glories not in himself, but in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, over his progress, pays due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. His threshold the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of destruction does not cross, for it is marked with the Lamb's blood and the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>.  He fears not the plagues of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and leaves his foes overwhelmed by the same waters by which he himself was saved. And so, dearly-beloved, with minds and bodies purified let us embrace the wondrous <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and, cleansed from all <q>the leaven of our old <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, let us keep </q> the Lord's <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> with due observance: so that, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> guiding us, we may be <q>separated</q> by no <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> <q>from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ ,</q> Who bringing peace by His blood to all things, has returned to the loftiness of the Father's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and yet not forsaken the lowliness of those who serve Him to Whom is the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
