<h1>Sermon 56 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[CVI. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse39">Luke 11:39</a> <em>, <q>Now do ye <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> cleanse the outside of the cup and the platter,</q> etc.</em></p>

<p>1. You have heard the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, how the Lord Jesus in that which He said to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, conveyed doubtless a lesson to His own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that they should not think that righteousness consists in the cleansing of the body. For every day did the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> wash themselves in water before they dined; as if a daily washing could be a cleansing of the heart. Then He showed what sort of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> they were. He told them who saw them; for He saw not their faces only but their inward parts. For that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, that <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, to whom Christ made answer, thought within himself, he uttered nothing aloud, yet the Lord heard him. For within himself he blamed the Lord Christ, because He had so come to his feast without having washed. He was thinking, the Lord heard, therefore He answered. What then did He answer? <q>Now do ye <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> wash the outside of the platter; but within you are full of guile and ravening.</q>  What! Is this to come to a feast! How did He not spare the man by whom He had been invited? Yea rather by rebuking He did spare him, that being reformed He might spare him in the judgment. And what is it that He shows to us? That Baptism also which is conferred once for all, cleanses by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is within, not without. Wherefore it is said and read in the Acts of the Apostles, <q>Cleansing their hearts by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q>  And the Apostle Peter thus speaks in his Epistle; <q>So too has He given you a similitude from <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah's</a> ark, how that eight <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were saved by water.</q> And then he added, <q>So also in a like figure will <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> save us, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.</q>  <q>This answer of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a></q> did the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> despise, and washed <q>that which was without;</q> within they continued full of pollution.</p>

<p>2. And what did He say to them after this? <q>But rather give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and behold all things are clean unto you.</q>  See the praise of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, do, and prove it. But mark awhile; this was said to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>. These <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> were <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the choice men as it were of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For those of most consideration and learning were then called <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>. They had not been washed by Christ's Baptism; they had not yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Christ, the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who walked among them, yet was not acknowledged by them. How then does He say to them, <q>Give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and behold all things are clean unto you</q>? If the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> had paid heed to Him, and given <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, at once according to His word <q>all things would have been clean to them;</q> what need then was there for them to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him? But if they could not be cleansed, except by believing on Him, who <q>cleanses the heart by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;</q> what means, <q>Give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and behold all things are clean unto you</q>? Let us carefully consider this, and perhaps He Himself explains it.</p>

<p>3. When He had spoken thus, doubtless they thought that they did give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. And how did they give them? They tithed all they had, they took away a tenth of all their produce, and gave it. It is no easy matter to find a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> who does as much. See what the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> did. Not wheat only, but wine, and oil; nor this only, but even the most trifling things, cummin, rue, mint, and anise,  in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to God's precept, they tithed all; put aside, that is, a tenth part, and gave <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of it. I suppose then that they recalled this to <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and thought that the Lord Christ was speaking to no purpose, as if to those who did not give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>; whereas they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> their own doings, how that they tithed, and gave <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of the minutest and most trifling of their produce. They mocked Him within themselves as He spoke thus, as if to men who did not give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this, immediately subjoined, <q>But woe unto you, <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, who <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> mint, and cummin, and rue, and all herbs.</q>  That ye may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, I am aware of your <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Doubtless these <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> are your <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>; yea even the minutest and most trifling of your fruits do ye <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a>; <q>Yet ye leave the weightier matters of the law, judgment and charity.</q> Mark. You have <q>left judgment and charity,</q> and you <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> herbs. This is not to do <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. <q>These,</q> says He, <q>ought ye to do, and not to leave the other undone.</q> Do what? <q>Judgment and charity, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and mercy;</q> and <q>not to leave the other undone.</q> Do these; but give the preference to the others.</p>

<p>4. If this be so, why did He say to them, <q>Do <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and behold all things are clean unto you</q>? What is, <q>Do <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a></q>? Do mercy. What is, <q>Do mercy</q>? If you understand, begin with your own self. For how should you be merciful to another, if you are cruel to yourself? <q>Give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and all things are clean unto you.</q> Do <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. What is <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>? Mercy. Hear the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>; <q>Have mercy on your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, pleasing God.</q>  Do <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, <q>Have mercy on your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, pleasing God.</q> Your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a beggar before you, return to your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Whosoever you are, who art living in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> or unbelief, return to your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; and there you find your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in beggary, you find it needy, you find it poor, you find it in sorrow, nay perhaps you do not find it in need, but dumb through its neediness. For if it beg, it <q>hungers after righteousness.</q> Now when you find your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in such a state (all this is within, in your heart), first do <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, give it bread. What bread? If the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> had asked this question, the Lord would have said to him, <q>Give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> For this He did say to him; but he did not understand it, when He enumerated to them the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> which they were used to do, and which they thought were unknown to Christ; and He says to them, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you do this, 'ye <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> mint and anise, cummin and rue;' but I am speaking of other <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>; ye despise 'judgment and charity.' In judgment and charity give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> What is <q>in judgment</q>? Look back, and discover yourself; mislike yourself, pronounce a judgment against yourself. And what is charity? <q>Love the Lord God with all your heart, and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with all your mind; <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself:</q>  and you have done <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> first to your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, within your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Whereas if you neglect this <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, give what you will, give how much you will; reserve of your goods not a tenth, but a half; give nine parts, and leave but one for your own self: you do nothing, when you do not <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and art poor in yourself. Let your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> have its food, that it perish not by famine. Give her bread. What bread, you will say? He speaks with you Himself. If you would hear, and understand, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the Lord, He would say to you Himself, I am the Living Bread which came down from heaven.  Would you not first give this Bread to your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and do <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> unto it? If then you believe, you ought so to do, that you may first feed your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Believe in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the things which are within shall be cleansed; and what is without shall be clean also. <q>Let us turn to the Lord,</q> etc.</p>
