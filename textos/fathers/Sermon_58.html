<h1>Sermon 58</h1>

<p> <em>(On the Passion, VII.)</em></p>

<h2>I. The reason of Christ suffering at the Paschal Feast</h2>

<p>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> indeed, dearly-beloved, that the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> festival partakes of so sublime a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> as to surpass not only the slender perceptions of my humility, but even the powers of great intellects. But I must not consider the greatness of the Divine work in such a way as to distrust or to feel ashamed of the service which I owe; for we may not hold our peace upon the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, even if it cannot be explained. But, your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> aiding us, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> God's Grace will be granted, to sprinkle the barrenness of our heart with the dew of His inspiration: that by the pastor's mouth things may be proclaimed which are useful to the ears of his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> flock. For when the Lord, the Giver of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, says: <q>open your mouth, and I will fill it ,</q> we dare likewise to reply in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> words: <q>Lord, You shall open my lips, and my mouth shall show forth Your praise. </q> Therefore beginning, dearly-beloved, to handle once more the Gospel-story of the Lord's Passion, we understand it was part of the Divine plan that the profane chiefs of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who had often sought occasion of venting their rage on Christ, should receive the power of exercising their fury at no other time than the Paschal festival. For the things which had long been promised under <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> figures had to be fulfilled in all clearness; for instance, the True Sheep had to supersede the sheep which was its antitype, and the One Sacrifice to bring to an end the multitude of different <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. For all those things which had been divinely ordained through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> about the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the lamb had prophesied of Christ and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> announced the slaying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In order, therefore, that the shadows should yield to the substance and types cease in the presence of the Reality, the ancient observance is removed by a new Sacrament, victim passes into Victim, blood is wiped away by Blood, and the law-ordained Feast is fulfilled by being changed.</p>

<h2>II. The leading Jews broke their own Law, as well as failed to apprehend the new dispensation in destroying Christ</h2>

<p>And hence, when the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> gathered the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and elders of the people together to their council, and the minds of all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were occupied with the purpose of doing wrong to Jesus, the teachers of the law put themselves without the law, and by their own <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> failure in duty abolished their ancestral ceremonies. For when the Paschal feast began, those who ought to have adorned the temple, cleansed the vessels, provided the victims, and employed a holier <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the purifications that the law enjoined, seized with the fury of traitorous <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, give themselves up to one work, and with uniform cruelty conspire for one crime, though they were doomed to gain nothing by the punishment of innocence and the condemnation of righteousness, except the failure to apprehend the new <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> and the violation of the old. The chiefs, therefore, in providing against a tumult arising on a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day <span class="stiki" id="note361001"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;26:5</a></span>, showed <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> not for the festival, but for a heinous crime; and their anxiety served not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of religion, but their own incrimination. For these careful pontiffs and anxious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> feared the occurrence of seditious riots on the principal feast-day, not lest the people should do wrong, but lest Christ should escape.</p>

<h2>III. Jesus instituting the Blessed Sacrament showed mercy to the traitor Judas to the last</h2>

<p>But Jesus, sure of His purpose and undaunted in carrying out His Father's will, fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and founded a new <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>. For while the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were lying down with Him at the mystic Supper, and when discussion was proceeding in the hall of <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> how Christ might be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, He, ordaining the Sacrament of His Body and Blood, was teaching them what kind of Victim must be offered up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not even from this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> was the betrayer kept away, in order to show that he was exasperated by no personal wrong, but had determined beforehand of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> upon his treachery. For he was his own source of ruin and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of perfidy, following the guidance of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and refusing to have Christ as director. And so when the Lord said, <q>Verily I say to you that one of you is about to betray Me,</q> He showed that His betrayer's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> was well known to Him, not confounding the traitor by harsh or open rebukes, but meeting him with mild and silent warnings that he who had never been sent astray by rejection, might the easier be set right by repentance. Why, unhappy Judas, do you not make use of so great long-suffering? Behold, the Lord spares your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> attempts; Christ betrays you to none save yourself. Neither your name nor your person is discovered, but only the secrets of your heart are touched by the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and mercy. The <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the apostolic rank is not denied you, nor yet a share in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a>. Return to your right mind; lay aside your <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> and be wise. Mercy invites you, Salvation knocks at the door, Life recalls you to life. Lo, your stainless and guiltless fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> shudder at the hint of your crime, and all tremble for themselves till the author of the treachery is declared. For they are saddened not by the accusations of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, but by the uncertainty of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> changeableness; fearing lest what each <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> against himself be less <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> than what the Truth Himself foresaw. But you abuse the Lord's patience in this panic of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and believest that your bold front hides you. You add impudence to guilt, and art not frightened by so clear a test. And when the others refrain from the food in which the Lord had set His judgment, you do not withdraw your hand from the dish, because your mind is not turned aside from the crime.</p>

<h2>IV. Various incidents of the Passion further explained and the reality of Christ's sufferings asserted</h2>

<p>And thus it followed, dearly-beloved, that as John the Evangelist has narrated, when the Lord offered the bread which He had dipped to His betrayer, more clearly to point him out, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> entirely seized Judas, and now, by his veritable act of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, took possession of one whom he had already bound down by his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> designs. For only in body was he lying there with those at meat: in mind he was arming the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the falseness of the witnesses, and the fury of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> mob. At last the Lord, seeing on what a gross crime Judas was bent says, <q>What you do, do quickly <span class="stiki" id="note361002"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;13:27</a></span> .</q> This is the voice not of command but of permission, and not of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> but of readiness: He, that has power over all times, shows that He puts no hindrance in the way of the traitor, and carries out the Father's will for the redemption of the world in such a way as neither to promote nor to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the crime which His persecutors were preparing. When Judas, therefore, at the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> persuasion, departed from Christ, and cut himself off from the unity of the Apostolic body, the Lord, without being disturbed by any <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but anxious only for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those He came to redeem, spent all the time that was free from His persecutors' attack on mystic conversation and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> teaching, as is declared in St. John's gospel: raising His eyes to heaven and beseeching the Father for the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that all whom the Father had and would give the Son might become one and remain undivided to the Redeemer's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and adding lastly that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in which He says, <q>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me <span class="stiki" id="note361003"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;26:39</a></span> .</q> Wherein it is not to be thought that the Lord Jesus wished to escape the Passion and the Death, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of which He had already committed to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples'</a> keeping, seeing that He Himself forbids Peter, when he was burning with devoted <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, to use the sword, saying, <q>The cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it <span class="stiki" id="note361004"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;18:11</a></span>?</q> and seeing that that is certain which the Lord also says, according to John's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him may not perish, but have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life ;</q> as also what the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says, <q>Christ loved us and gave Himself for us, a victim to God for a sweet-smelling savour <span class="stiki" id="note361006"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;5:2</a></span> .</q> For the saving of all through the Cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was the common will and the common plan of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; nor could that by any means be disturbed which before <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> ages had been mercifully determined and unchangeably fore-ordained. Therefore in assuming <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and entire manhood He took the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sensations of the body and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> feelings of the mind. And it does not follow because everything in Him was full of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, full of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, that therefore He either shed false tears or took food from pretended hunger or feigned slumber. It was in our humility that He was despised, with our grief that He was saddened, with our pain that He was racked on the cross. For His compassion underwent the sufferings of our mortality with the purpose of healing them, and His power encountered them with the purpose of conquering them. And this Isaiah has most plainly prophesied, saying, <q>He carries our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and is pained for us, and we thought Him to be in pain and in stripes and in vexation. But He was wounded for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and was stricken for our offenses, and with His bruises we are healed. </q></p>

<h2>V. The resignation of Christ is an undying lesson to the Church</h2>

<p>And so, dearly beloved, when the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> says, <q>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me ,</q> He uses the outcry of our nature, and pleads the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty and trembling: that our patience may be strengthened and our fears driven away in the things which we have to bear. At length, ceasing even to ask this now that He had in a measure palliated our weak fears, though it is not expedient for us to retain them, He passes into another mood, and says, <q>Nevertheless, not as I will but as You;</q> and again, <q>If this cup can not pass from Me, except I drink it, Your will be done. </q> These words of the Head are the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the whole Body: these words have instructed all the faithful, kindled the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of all the confessors, crowned all the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. For who could overcome the world's <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, the blasts of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, the terrors of persecutors, had not Christ, in the name of all and for all, said, to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>Your will be done?</q> Then let the words be learned by all the Church's sons who have been purchased at so great a price, so freely justified: and when the shock of some violent <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> has fallen on them, let them use the aid of this potent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that they may conquer their <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling, and learn to suffer patiently. From this point, dearly-beloved, our sermon must pass to the consideration of the details of the Lord's Passion, and lest we should burden you with prolixity, we will divide our common task, and put off the rest  till the fourth day of the week. God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> will be vouchsafed to you if you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> Him to give me the power of carrying out my duty: through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, etc.</p>
