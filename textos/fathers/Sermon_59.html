<h1>Sermon 59</h1>

<p> <em>(On the Passion, VIII.: on Wednesday in Holy Week.)</em></p>

<h2>I. Christ's arrest fulfils His own eternal purpose</h2>

<p>Having discoursed, dearly beloved, in our last sermon, on the events which preceded the Lord's arrest, it now remains, by the help of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to discuss, as we promised, the details of the Passion itself. When the Lord had made it clear by the words of His sacred <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that the Divine and the Human Nature was most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and fully present in Him, showing that the unwillingness to suffer proceeded from the one, and from the other the determination to suffer by the expulsion of all frail fears and the strengthening of His lofty power, then did He return to His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> purpose, and <q>in the form of a</q> sinless <q>slave</q> encounter the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who was savagely attacking Him by the hands of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: that He in Whom alone was all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> nature without fault, might undertake the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all. The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of darkness, therefore, assailed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light, and, for all their torches and lanterns , could not escape the night of their own unbelief, because they did not recognize the Fount of Light. They arrest Him, and He is ready to be seized; they lead Him away, and He is willing to be led; for though, if He had willed to resist, their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> hands could have done Him no harm, yet thereby the world's redemption would have been impeded, and He, who was to die for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, would have saved none at all.</p>

<h2>II. How great was Pilate's crime in allowing himself to be led astray by the Jews</h2>

<p>Accordingly, permitting the infliction on Himself of all that the people's fury inflamed by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> dared do, He is brought to <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a>, father-in-law to <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, and thence <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> passes Him on to <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>: and after the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a>' mad accusations, after the lying falsehoods of suborned witnesses, He is transferred to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> hearing by the delegation of the two high-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who in neglecting the Divine law, and exclaiming that they had <q>no king but C&aelig;sar,</q> as if they were devoted to the Roman <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and had left the whole judgment in the hands of the governor, really sought for an accomplisher of their cruelty rather than an umpire of the case. For they gave up Jesus, bound in hard bonds, bruised by many buffets and blows, spat upon, already condemned by their shouts: so that amidst so many signs of their own verdict <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> might not dare to acquit One Whom all desired to perish. In fact, the very inquiry shows both that he found in the Accused no fault and that in his judgment he did not adhere to his purpose: for as judge he condemns One Whom he pronounces guiltless, invoking on the unrighteous people the blood of the Righteous Man with Whom he felt by his own conviction, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> from his wife's dream , he must have nothing to do. That stained <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not cleansed by the washing of hands, there is no expiation in water-besprinkled fingers for the crime abetted by that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> mind. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> fault is indeed, less than the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews'</a> crime; for it was they that terrified him with C&aelig;sar's name, chode him with hateful words, and drove him to perpetrate his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. But he also did not escape incrimination for playing into the hands of those that made the uproar, for abandoning his own judgment, and for acquiescing in the charges of others.</p>

<h2>III. Yet the Jews' guilt was infinitely greater</h2>

<p>In bowing, therefore, dearly-beloved, to the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of the implacable people, in permitting Jesus to be dishonoured by much mocking, and harassed with excessive insults, and in displaying Him to the eyes of His persecutors lacerated with scourges, crowned with thorns, and clothed in a robe of scorn, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> doubtless thought to appease the enemies' minds, so that when they had glutted their cruel <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, they might cease further to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> One Whom they beheld subjected to such a variety of afflictions. But their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> was still in full blaze, and they cried out to him to release Barabbas and thus, Jesus bear the penalty of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and thus, when with consenting murmur the crowd said <q>His blood be on us and on our sons ,</q> those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> folk gained, to their own damnation what they had persistently demanded, <q>whose teeth,</q> as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, <q>were arms and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. </q> For in vain did they keep their own hands from crucifying the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> when they had hurled at Him the tongue's deadly darts and the poisoned weapons of words. On you, on you, false <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> leaders of the people, falls the full weight of that crime: and although the enormity of the guilt involves the governor and the soldiers also, yet you are the primary and chief offenders. And in Christ's condemnation, whatsoever wrong was done either by <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> judgment or by the cohorts carrying out of his commands, makes you only the more deserving of the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, because the impulse of your fury would not let even those be free from guilt who were displeased at your unrighteous acts.</p>

<h2>IV. Christ bearing His own cross is an eternal lesson to the Church</h2>

<p>And so the Lord was handed over to their savage wishes, and in mockery of His kingly state, ordered to be the bearer of His own instrument of death, that what Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> foresaw might be fulfilled, saying, <q>Behold a Child is born, and a Son is given to us whose government is upon His shoulders. </q> When, therefore, the Lord carried the wood of the cross which should turn for Him into the sceptre of power, it was indeed in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> a mighty mockery, but to the faithful a mighty <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> was set forth, seeing that He, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> vanquisher of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a>, and the strong defeater of the powers that were against Him, was carrying in noble sort the trophy of His triumph, and on the shoulders of His unconquered patience bore into all realms the adorable sign of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: as if even then to confirm all His followers by this mere <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of His work, and say, <q>He that takes not his cross and follows Me, is not worthy of Me <span class="stiki" id="note361016"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;10:38</a></span> .</q></p>

<h2>V. The transference of the cross from the Lord to Simon of Cyrene signifies the participation of the Gentiles in His sufferings</h2>

<p>But as the multitudes went with Jesus to the place of punishment, a certain Simon of Cyrene was found on whom to lay the wood of the cross instead of the Lord; that even by this act might be pre-signified the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles'</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to whom the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was to be not shame but <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. It was not accidental, therefore, but <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> and mystical, that while the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were raging against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, a foreigner was found to share His sufferings, as the Apostle says, <q>if we suffer with Him, we shall also reign with Him <span class="stiki" id="note361017"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:12</a></span> </q>; so that no Hebrew nor Israelite, but a stranger, was substituted for the Saviour in His most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> degradation. For by this transference the propitiation of the spotless Lamb and the fulfilment of all <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> passed from the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> to the uncircumcision, from the sons according to the flesh to the sons according to the spirit: since as the Apostle says, <q>Christ our <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">Passover</a> is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> for us <span class="stiki" id="note361018"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:7</a></span>,</q> Who offering Himself to the Father a new and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of reconciliation, was crucified not in the temple, whose worship was now at an end, and not within the confines of the city which for its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was doomed to be destroyed, but outside, <q>without the camp <span class="stiki" id="note361019"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse12">Hebrews&nbsp;13:12</a></span>,</q> that, on the cessation of the old symbolic victims, a new Victim might be placed on a new altar, and the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> might be the altar not of the temple but of the world.</p>

<h2>VI. We are to see not only the cross but the meaning of it</h2>

<p>Accordingly, dearly-beloved, Christ being lifted up upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, let the eyes of your mind not dwell only on that sight which those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> sinners saw, to whom it was said by the mouth of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>And your life shall be hanging before your eyes, and you shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> day and night, and shall not be assured of your life <span class="stiki" id="note361020"><a href="../bible/deu028.htm#verse66">Deuteronomy&nbsp;28:66</a></span> .</q> For in the crucified Lord they could think of nothing but their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> deed, having not the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is justified, but that by which an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is racked. But let our understandings, illumined by the Spirit of Truth, foster with pure and free heart the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the cross which irradiates heaven and earth, and see with the inner sight what the Lord meant when He spoke of His coming Passion: <q>The hour has come that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> :</q> and below He says, <q>Now is My spirit troubled. And what shall I say? Father, save Me from this hour, but for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> came I unto this hour. Father, glorify Your Son.</q> And when the Father's voice came from heaven, saying, <q>I have both <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> it and will glorify it again,</q> Jesus in reply said to those that stood by, <q>This voice came not for Me but for you. Now is the world's judgment, now shall the prince of this world be cast out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things unto Me. </q></p>

<h2>VII. The power of the cross is universally attractive</h2>

<p>O wondrous power of the Cross! O ineffable <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Passion, in which is contained the Lord's tribunal, the world's judgment, and the power of the Crucified! For you drew all things unto You, Lord and when You had stretched out Your hands all the day, long to an unbelieving people that gainsaid You <span class="stiki" id="note361023"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;65:2</a></span>, the whole world at last was brought to confess Your majesty. You drew all things unto You, Lord, when all the elements combined to pronounce judgment in execration of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews'</a> crime, when the lights of heaven were darkened, and the day turned into night, and the earth also was shaken with unwonted shocks, and all creation refused to serve those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men. You drew all things unto You, Lord, for the veil of the temple was rent, and the Holy of Holies <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> no more for those unworthy high-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: so that type was turned into Truth, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> into Revelation, law into <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. You drew all things unto You, Lord, so that what before was done in the one temple of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in dark signs, was now to be celebrated everywhere by the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of all the nations in full and open rite. For now there is a nobler rank of <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, there are elders of greater dignity and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of holier anointing: because Your cross is the fount of all blessings, the source of all graces, and through it the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> receive strength for weakness, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for shame, life for death. Now, too, the variety of fleshly <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> has ceased, and the one offering of Your Body and Blood fulfils all those different victims: for You are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <q>Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that takest away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the world <span class="stiki" id="note361024"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;1:29</a></span>,</q> and in Yourself so accomplishest all <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, that as there is but one <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> instead of many victims, so there is but one kingdom instead of many nations.</p>

<h2>VIII. We must live not for ourselves but for Christ, who died for us</h2>

<p>Let us, then, dearly-beloved, confess what the blessed teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, confessed, saying, <q>Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners <span class="stiki" id="note361025"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:15</a></span> .</q> For God's mercy towards us is the more wonderful that Christ died not for the righteous nor for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, but for the unrighteous and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; and though the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Godhead could not sustain the sting of death, yet at His birth He took from us that which He might offer for us. For of old He threatened our death with the power of His death, saying by the mouth of Hosea the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>O death, I will be your death, and I will be your destruction, O <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> <span class="stiki" id="note361026"><a href="../bible/hos013.htm#verse14">Hosea&nbsp;13:14</a></span> .</q> For by dying He underwent the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, but by rising again He broke them, and so destroyed the continuity of death as to make it temporal instead of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. <q>For as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive <span class="stiki" id="note361027"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:22</a></span> .</q> And so, dearly-beloved, let that come to pass of which S. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> speaks, <q>that they that live, should henceforth not live to themselves but to Him who died for all and rose again <span class="stiki" id="note361028"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:15</a></span> .</q> And because the old things have passed away and all things have become new, let none remain in his old carnal life, but let us all be renewed by daily progress and growth in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. For however much a man be justified, yet so long as he remains in this life, he can always be more approved and better. And he that is not advancing is going back, and he that is gaining nothing is losing something. Let us run, then, with the steps of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by the works of mercy, in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of righteousness, that keeping the day of our redemption spiritually, <q>not in the old leaven of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but in the unleavened bread of sincerity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <span class="stiki" id="note361029"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:8</a></span>,</q> we may deserve to be partakers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> resurrection, Who with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> lives and reigns for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
