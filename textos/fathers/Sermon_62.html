<h1>Sermon 62</h1>

<p> <em>(On the Passion, XI.)</em></p>

<h2>I. The mystery of the Passion passes man's comprehension</h2>

<p>The Feast of the Lord's Passion  that we have longed for and that the whole world may well desire, has come, and suffers us not to keep silence in the tumult of our spiritual joys: because though it is difficult to speak often on the same thing worthily and appropriately, yet the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is not free to withhold from the people's ears instruction by sermon on this great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of God's mercy, inasmuch as the subject itself, being unspeakable, gives him ease of utterance, and what is said cannot altogether fail where what is said can never be enough. Let <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty, then, succumb to God's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and ever acknowledge itself unequal to the unfolding of His works of mercy. Let us toil in thought, fail in insight, falter in utterance: it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that even our right thoughts about the Lord's Majesty should be insufficient. For, remembering what the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>Seek the Lord and be strengthened: seek His face always ,</q> no one must assume that he has found all he seeks, lest he fail of coming near, if he cease his endeavours. And amidst all the works of God which weary out man's wondering <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, what so delights and so baffles our mind's gaze as the Saviour's Passion? Ponder as we may upon His omnipotence, which is of one and equal substance with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the humility in God is more stupendous than the power, and it is harder to grasp the complete emptying of the Divine Majesty than the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> uplifting of the <q>slave's form</q> in Him. But we are much aided in our understanding of it by the remembrance that though the Creator and the creature, the Inviolable God and the passible flesh, are absolutely different, yet the properties of both substances meet together in Christ's one Person in such a way that alike in His acts of weakness and of power the degradation belongs to the same Person as the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<h2>II. The Creed takes up St. Peter's confession as the fundamental doctrine of the Church</h2>

<p>In that rule of Faith, dearly-beloved, which we have received in the very beginning of the Creed, on the authority of apostolic teaching, we acknowledge <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, whom we call the only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> the Father Almighty, to be also born of the Virgin Mary by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Nor do we reject His Majesty when we express our belief in His crucifixion, death, and resurrection on the third day. For all that is God's and all that is Man's are simultaneously fulfilled by His Manhood and His Godhead, so that in virtue of the union of the Passible with the Impassible, His power cannot be affected by His weakness, nor His weakness overcome by His power. And rightly was the blessed Apostle Peter praised for confessing this union, who when the Lord was inquiring what the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of Him, quickly anticipated the rest and said, <q>You are Christ, the Son of the living God. </q> And this assuredly he saw, not by the revelation of flesh or blood, which might have hindered his inner sight, but by the very Spirit of the Father working in his believing heart, that in preparation for ruling the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> he might first learn what he would have to teach, and for the solidification of the Faith, which he was destined to preach, might receive the assurance, <q>You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail against it. </q> The strength, therefore, of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Faith, which, built upon an impregnable rock, fears not the gates of death, acknowledges the one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to be both <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Man, believing Him likewise to be the Virgin's Son, Who is His Mother's Creator: born also at the end of the ages, though He is the Creator of time: Lord of all power, and yet one of mortal stock: <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and yet <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> for sinners after the likeness of sinful flesh.</p>

<h2>III. The Devil's devices were turned against himself</h2>

<p>And in order that He might set the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> free from the bonds of deadly transgression, He hid the power of His majesty from the raging <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and opposed him with our frail and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> nature. For if the cruel and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> foe could have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the counsel of God's mercy, he would have aimed at soothing the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews'</a> minds into gentleness rather than at firing them with unrighteous <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, lest he should lose the thraldom of all his captives in assailing the liberty of One Who owed him nought. Thus he was foiled by his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>: he inflicted a punishment on the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, which was turned to the healing of all the sons of men. He shed righteous Blood, which became the ransom and the drink for the world's atonement. The Lord undertook that which He chose according to the purpose of His own will. He permitted madmen to lay their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> hands upon Him: hands which, in ministering to their own doom, were of service to the Redeemer's work. And yet so great was His loving compassion for even His murderers, that He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the Father on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and begged not for His own vengeance but for their forgiveness, saying, <q>Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do <span class="stiki" id="note361034"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;23:34</a></span> .</q> And such was the power of that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that the hearts of many of those who had said, <q>His blood be on us and on our sons <span class="stiki" id="note361035"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;27:25</a></span>,</q> were turned to penitence by the Apostle Peter's preaching, and on one day there were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> about 3,000 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: and they all were <q>of one heart and of one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <span class="stiki" id="note361036"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse32">Acts&nbsp;4:32</a></span>,</q> being ready now to die for Him, Whose crucifixion they had demanded.</p>

<h2>IV. Why Judas could not obtain forgiveness through Christ</h2>

<p>To this forgiveness the traitor Judas could not attain: for he, the son of perdition, at whose right the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> stood , gave himself up to despair before Christ accomplished the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of universal redemption. For in that the Lord died for sinners, perchance even he might have found <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> if he had not hastened to hang himself. But that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> heart, which was now given up to thievish frauds, and now busied with treacherous designs, had never entertained anything of the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the Saviour's mercy. Those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> ears had heard the Lord's words, when He said, <q>I came not to call the righteous but sinners <span class="stiki" id="note361038"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;9:13</a></span>,</q> and <q>The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> came to seek and to save that which was lost <span class="stiki" id="note361039"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;19:10</a></span>,</q> but they conveyed not to his understanding the clemency of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which not only healed bodily infirmities, but also cured the wounds of sick <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, saying to the paralytic man, <q>Son, be of good cheer, your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you <span class="stiki" id="note361040"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;9:3</a></span>;</q> saying also to the adulteress that was brought to Him, <q>neither will I condemn you; go and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more ,</q> to show in all His works that He had come as the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, not the Judge of the world. But the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> traitor refused to understand this, and took measures against himself, not in the self-condemnation of repentance, but in the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of perdition, and thus he who had sold the Author of life to His murderers, even in dying increased the amount of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which condemned him.</p>

<h2>V. The cruelty of Christ's crucifixion is lost in its wondrous power</h2>

<p>Accordingly that which false witnesses, cruel leaders of the people, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> did against the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, through the agency of a coward governor and an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> band of soldiers, has been at once the abhorrence and the rejoicing of all ages. For though the Lord's cross was part of the cruel purpose of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, yet is it of wondrous power through Him they crucified. The people's fury was directed against One, and the mercy of Christ is for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. That which their cruelty inflicts He voluntarily undergoes, in order that the work of His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> will may be carried out through their unhindered crime. And hence the whole order of events which is most fully narrated in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> must be received by the faithful in such a way that by implicit belief in the occurrences which happened at the time of the Lord's Passion, we should understand that not only was the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> accomplished by Christ, but also the standard of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> satisfied. But that this may be more thoroughly discussed by the Lord's help, let us reserve this portion of the subject till the fourth day of the week.  God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, we hope, will be vouchsafed at your entreaties to help us to fulfil our promise: through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, etc. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
