<h1>Sermon 65 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[CXV. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse1">Luke 18:1</a> <em>,<q>They ought always to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and not to faint,</q> etc. And on the two who went up into the temple to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>: and of the little children who were presented unto Christ.</em></p>

<p>1. The lesson of the Holy <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> builds us up unto the duty of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and believing, and of not putting our trust in ourselves, but in the Lord. What greater encouragement to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> than the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> which is proposed to us of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judge? For an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judge, who feared not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor regarded man, yet gave ear to a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who besought him, overcome by her importunity, not inclined thereto by kindness.  If he then heard her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> to be asked, how must He hear who exhorts us to ask? When therefore by this comparison from a contrary case the Lord had taught that <q>men ought always to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and not to faint,</q>  He added and said, <q>Nevertheless, when the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> shall come, do you think that He shall find <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the earth?</q>  If <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fail, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> perishes. For who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for that which he does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? Whence also the blessed Apostle, when he exhorted to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, said, <q>Whosoever shall call upon the Name of the Lord, shall be saved.</q>  And in order to show that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the fountain of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, he went on and said, <q>How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>?</q>  So then that we may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; and that this same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> fail not, let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. Faith pours out <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and the pouring out of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> obtains the strengthening of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Faith, I say, pours out <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the pouring out of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> obtains strengthening even for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself. For that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might not fail in <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, therefore did the Lord say, Watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, lest ye enter into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.  <q>Watch,</q> He says, <q>and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, lest ye enter into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q> What is to <q>enter into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>,</q> but to depart from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? For so far <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> advances as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> gives way: and so far <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> gives way, as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> advances. For that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, Beloved, more plainly, that the Lord said, <q>Watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, lest ye enter into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>,</q> as touching <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> lest it should fail and perish; He said in the same place of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>This night has <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> desired to sift  you as wheat, and I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for you, Peter, that your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fail not.</q>  He that defends <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, and shall not he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> who is in peril? For in the words of the Lord, <q>when the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> shall come, do you think that He shall find <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the earth?</q> He spoke of that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is perfect. For it is scarce found on the earth. Lo! This <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> is full: and who would come hither, if there were no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? But who would not remove mountains, if there were full <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Look at the very Apostles: they would not have left all they had, have trodden under foot this world's hope, and followed the Lord, if they had not had great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and yet if they had full <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they would not have said to the Lord, <q>Increase our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q>  See again, that man confessing both of himself (behold <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, yet not full <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>), who when he had presented to the Lord his son to be cured of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit, and was asked whether he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, answered and said, <q>Lord, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, help my unbelief.</q>  <q>Lord,</q> says he, <q>I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</q> I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; therefore there was <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But <q>help my unbelief,</q> therefore there was not full <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>2. But inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> belongs not to the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, <q>He spoke this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> unto certain who seemed to themselves to be righteous, and despised others. Two men went up into the temple to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, the one a <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, and the other a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> said, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I thank You that I am not as the rest of men.</q>  He might at least have said, <q>as many men.</q> What does, <q>as the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> mean, but all except himself? <q>I,</q> he says, <q>am just, the rest are sinners.</q> <q>I am not as the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, extortioners, adulterers.</q> And, lo, from your neighbour, the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>, you take occasion of greater <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. <q>As,</q> he says, <q>this <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>.</q> <q>I,</q> he says, <q>am alone, he is of the rest.</q> <q>I am not,</q> says he, <q>such as he is, through my righteous <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, whereby I have no unrighteousness.</q> <q>I fast twice in the week, I give <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of all that I possess.</q>  In all his words seek out for any one thing that he asked of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and you will find nothing. He went up to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>: he had no mind to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to laud himself. Nay, it is but a small part of it, that he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but lauded himself. More than this he even mocked him that did <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. <q>But the Publican stood afar off;</q>  and yet he was in deed near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The consciousness of his heart kept him off, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> brought him close. <q>But the Publican stood afar off:</q> yet the Lord regarded him near. <q>For the Lord is high, yet has He respect unto the lowly.</q>  But <q>those that are high</q> as was this <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, <q>He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> afar off.</q> <q>The high</q> indeed <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> afar off,</q> but He does not pardon them. Hear still more the humility of the Publican. It is but a small matter that he stood afar off; <q>he did not even lift up his eyes unto heaven.</q> He looked not, that he might be looked upon. He did not dare to look upwards, his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> pressed him down: but hope lifted him up. Hear again, <q>he smote his breast.</q> He punished himself: wherefore the Lord spared him for his confession. <q>He smote his breast, saying, Lord, be merciful to me a sinner.</q> See who he is that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>. Why do you marvel that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should pardon, when he acknowledges his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Thus you have heard the case  of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> and Publican; now hear the sentence; you have heard the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> accuser, you have heard the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> criminal; hear now the Judge. <q>Verily I say unto you.</q> The Truth says, God says, the Judge says it. <q>Verily I say unto you, That Publican went down from the temple justified rather than that <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>.</q>  Tell us, Lord, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Lo! I see that the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> goes down from the temple justified rather than the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>. I ask why? Do you ask why? Hear why. <q>Because every one that exalts himself shall be abased, and he that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself shall be exalted.</q>  You have heard the sentence, beware of its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. In other words, you have heard the sentence, beware of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.</p>

<p>3. Let now those ungodly babblers, whosoever they be, who presume on their own strength, let them hear and see these things: let them hear who say, God made me a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, I make myself just. O you who are worse and more detestable than the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>! The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> did indeed call himself just, but yet he gave thanks to God for it. He called himself just, but yet he gave God thanks. <q>I thank You, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that I am not as the rest of men.</q> <q>I thank You, O God.</q> He gives God thanks, that he is not as the rest of men: and yet he is blamed as being <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and puffed up; not in that he gave God thanks, but in that he desired as it were no more to be added unto him. <q>I thank you that I am not as the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</q> So then you are just; so then you ask for nothing; so then you are full already; so then the life of man is not a trial upon earth;  so then you are full already; so then you abound already, so then you have no ground for saying, <q>Forgive us our debts!</q> What must his case be then who impiously impugns <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, if he is blamed who give thanks proudly?</p>

<p>4. And, lo, after the case had been stated, and the sentence pronounced, little children also came forth, yea, rather, are carried and presented to be touched. To be touched by whom, but the Physician? Surely, it will be said, they must be whole. To whom are the infants presented to be touched? To whom? To the Saviour. If to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, they are brought to be saved. To whom, but to Him <q>who came to seek and to save what was lost.</q>  How were they lost? As far as concerns them personally, I see that they are without fault, I am seeking for their guiltiness. Whence is it? I listen to the Apostle, <q>By one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world. By one man,</q> he says, <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by him in whom all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q>  Let then the little children come, let them come: let the Lord be heard. <q>Suffer little children to come unto Me.</q>  Let the little ones come, let the sick come to the Physician, the lost to their Redeemer: let them come, let no man hinder them. In the branch they have not yet committed any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but they are ruined in their root. <q>Let the Lord bless the small with the great.</q>  Let the Physician touch both small and great. The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the little ones we commend to their elders. Speak ye for them who are mute, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them who weep. If you are not their elders to no purpose, be ye their guardians: defend them who are not able yet to manage their own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Common is the loss, let the finding be common: we were lost all together, together be we found in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Uneven is the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, but common is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. They have no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> but what they have drawn from the source: they have no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> but what they have derived from the first original. Let not them keep them off from <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, who to what they have so derived have added much more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The elder in age is the elder in iniquity too. But the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God effaces what you have derived, effaces too what you have added. For, <q>where <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> abounded, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has superabounded.</q> </p>
