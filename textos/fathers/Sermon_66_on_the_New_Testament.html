<h1>Sermon 66 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[CXVI. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse36">Luke 24:36</a> <em>, <q>He himself stood in the midst of them, and says unto them, peace be unto you,</q> etc.</em></p>

<p>1. The Lord appeared to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, as you have heard, and saluted them, saying, <q>Peace be unto you.</q>  This is peace indeed, and the salutation of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: for the very word salutation has received its name from <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.  And what can be better than that Salvation Itself should salute man? For Christ is our Salvation. He is our Salvation, who was wounded for us, and fixed by nails to the tree, and being taken down from the tree, was laid in the sepulchre. And from the sepulchre He arose, with His wounds healed, His scars kept. For this He judged expedient for His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that His scars should be kept, where by the wounds of their hearts might be healed. What wounds? The wounds of unbelief. For He appeared to their eyes, exhibiting real flesh, and they thought they saw a spirit. It is no light wound, this wound of the heart. Yea, they have made a malignant <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> who have abided in this wound. But do we suppose that the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had not been wounded, because they were so quickly healed? Only, Beloved, suppose, if they had continued in this wound, to think that the Body which had been buried, could not rise again, but that a spirit in the image of a body, deceived the eyes of men: if they had continued in this belief, yea, rather in this unbelief, not their wounds, but their death would have had to be bewailed.</p>

<p>2. But what said the Lord Jesus? <q>Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts ascend into your hearts?</q>  If thoughts ascend into your heart, the thoughts come from the earth. But it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not that a thought should ascend into his heart, but that his heart should itself ascend upwards, where the Apostle would have <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> place their hearts, to whom he said, <q>If you be risen with Christ, mind those things which are above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Seek those things which are above, not the things which are upon the earth. For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. When Christ your life shall appear, then shall you also appear with Him in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q>  In what <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the resurrection. In what <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? Hear the Apostle saying of this body, <q>It is sown in dishonour, it shall rise in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q>  This <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> the Apostles were unwilling to assign to their Master, their Christ, their Lord: they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that His Body could rise from the sepulchre: they thought Him to be a Spirit, though they saw His flesh, and they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not their very eyes. Yet we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them who preach but do not show Him. Lo, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not Christ who showed Himself to them. Malignant wound! Let the remedies for these scars come forth. <q>Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts ascend into your hearts? See My hands and My feet,</q> where I was fixed with the nails. <q>Handle and see.</q> But ye see, and yet do not see. <q>Handle and see.</q> What? <q>That a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have. When He had thus spoken,</q> so it is written, <q>He showed them His hands and His feet.</q> </p>

<p>3. <q>And while they were yet in hesitation, and wondered for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</q>  Now there was <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> already, and yet hesitation continued. For a thing incredible had taken place, yet taken place it had. Is it at this day a thing incredible, that the Body of the Lord rose again from the sepulchre? The whole cleansed world  has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it; whoso has not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it, has remained in his uncleanness. Yet at that time it was incredible: and persuasion was addressed not to the eyes only, but to the hands also, that by the bodily senses <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might descend into their heart, and that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> so descending into their heart might be preached throughout the world to them who neither saw nor touched, and yet without doubting <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. <q>Have ye,</q> says He, <q>anything to eat?</q> How much does the good Builder still to build up the edifice of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? He did not hunger, yet He asked to eat. And He ate by an act of His power, not through necessity. So then let the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> acknowledge the verity of His body, which the world has acknowledged at their preaching.</p>

<p>4. If haply there be any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who still in their hearts maintain that Christ exhibited Himself to sight, but that Christ's was not very flesh; let them now lay aside that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and let the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> persuade them. We do but blame them for entertaining this conceit: He will damn them if they shall persevere in it. Who are you who dost not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that a body laid in the sepulchre could rise again? If you are a Manichee, who dost not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He was crucified either, because you do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He was even born, you declare that all that He showed was false. He showed what was false, and do you speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Thou dost not lie with your mouth, and did He lie in His body? Lo you suppose that He appeared unto the eyes of men what He really was not, that He was a spirit, not flesh. Hear Him: He loves you, let Him not condemn you. Hear Him speaking: lo, He speaks to you, you unhappy one, He speaks to you, <q>Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts ascend into your heart?</q> <q>See,</q> says He, <q>My hands and My feet. Handle and see, because a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see Me have.</q> This spoke the Truth, and did He deceive? It was a body then, it was flesh; that which had been buried, appeared. Let doubting perish, and meet praise ensue.</p>

<p>5. He showed himself then to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. What is <q>Himself</q>? The Head of His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The Church was foreseen by Him as in you to be throughout the world, by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> it was not yet seen. He showed the Head, He promised the Body. For what did He add next? <q>These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you.</q>  What is this, <q>While I was yet with you</q>? Was He not with them then when He was speaking to them? What is, <q>when I was yet with you</q>? Was with you as mortal, which now I am not. I was with you when I had yet to die. What is, <q>with you</q>? With you who were to die, Myself to die. Now I am no more with you: for I am with those who are to die, Myself to die no more for ever. This then is what I said to you. What? <q>That all things must be fulfilled which are written in the Law, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms concerning Me.</q>  I told you that all things must be fulfilled. <q>Then opened He their understanding.</q>  Come then, O Lord, employ Your keys, open, that we may understand. Lo, Thou dost tell all things, and yet are not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. You are thought to be a spirit, art touched, art rudely handled,  and yet they who touch You hesitate. Thou dost admonish them out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and yet they understand You not. Their hearts are closed, open, and enter in. He did so. <q>Then opened He their understanding.</q> Open, O Lord, yea, open the heart of him who is in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning Christ. Open <q>his</q> understanding who believes that Christ was a phantom. <q>Then opened He their understanding, that they might understand the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>.</q></p>

<p>6. And <q>He said unto them.</q> What? <q>That thus it behooved. That thus it is written, and thus it behooved.</q> What? <q>That Christ should suffer, and rise from the dead the third day.</q>  And this they saw, they saw Him suffering, they saw Him hanging, they saw Him with them alive after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. What then did they not see? The Body, that is, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Him they saw, her they saw not. They saw the Bridegroom, the Bride yet lay hid. Let him promise her too. <q>Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day.</q> This is the Bridegroom, what of the Bride? <q>And that repentance and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be preached in His Name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</q>  This the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> did not yet see: they did not yet see the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. They saw the Head, and they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the Head touching the Body. By this which they saw, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that which they saw not. We too are like to them: we see something which they saw not, and something we do not see which they did see. What do we see, which they saw not? The Church throughout all nations. What do we not see, which they saw? Christ present in the flesh. As they saw Him, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> concerning the Body, so do we see the Body; let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> concerning the Head. Let what we have respectively seen help us. The sight of Christ helped them to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the future Church: the sight of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> helps us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Christ has risen. Their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was made complete, and ours is made complete also. Their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was made complete from the sight of the Head, ours is made complete by the sight of the Body. Christ was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them <q>wholly,</q> and to us is He so made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: but He was not seen <q>wholly</q> by them, nor by us has He been <q>wholly</q> seen. By them the Head was seen, the Body <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. By us the Body has been seen, the Head <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Yet to none is Christ lacking: in all He is complete, though to this day His Body remains imperfect. The Apostles <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; through them many of the inhabitants of Jerusalem <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; Jud&aelig;a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Let the members be added on, the building added on to the foundation. <q>For no other foundation can any man lay,</q> says the Apostle, <q>than that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus.</q>  Let the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> rage madly, and be filled with jealousy: Stephen be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, Saul keep the raiment of them who stone him, Saul, one day to be the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>.  Let Stephen be killed, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Jerusalem dispersed in confusion: out of it go forth burning brands, and spread themselves and spread their flame. For in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Jerusalem, as it were burning brands were set on fire by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, when they had all one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and one heart to God-ward.  When Stephen was <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, that pile suffered <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>: the brands were dispersed, and the world was set on fire.</p>

<p>7. And then intent on his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> schemes, that Saul received letters from the chief of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and began his journey in his cruel rage, breathing out slaughter, thirsting for blood, to drag bound and to hurry off to punishment whomsoever he could, and from every quarter that he could, and to satiate himself with the shedding of their blood. But where was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where was Christ, where He that had crowned Stephen? Where, but in heaven? Let Him now look on Saul, and mock him in his fury, and call from heaven, <q>'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?'  I am in heaven, and you in earth, and yet you persecute Me. Thou dost not touch the body, but my members you are treading down. Yet what are you doing? What are you gaining? 'It is hard for you to kick against the pricks.' Kick as you will, you only distress yourself. Lay aside your fury then, recover soundness. Lay aside <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsel, seek after good succour.</q> By that voice he was struck to the earth. Who was struck to the earth? The persecutor. Lo, by that one word was he overcome. After what were you going, after what was your fury carrying you? Those whom you were seeking out, now you follow; whom you were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a>, now for them you suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. He rises up the preacher, who was struck to the earth, the persecutor. He heard the Lord's voice. He was blinded, but in the body only, that he might be enlightened in heart. He was brought to Ananias, catechised on sundry points, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and so came forth an Apostle. Speak then, preach, preach Christ, spread His doctrine, O you goodly leader of the flock,  but lately a wolf. See him, mark him, who once was raging. <q>But for me, God forbid that I should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, save in the Cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.</q>  Spread the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: scatter with your mouth what you have conceived in your heart. Let the nations hear, let the nations <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; let the nations multiply, let the Lord's empurpled spouse spring forth from the blood of Martyrs. And from her how many have come already, how many members have cleaved to the Head, and cleave to Him still and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>! They were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and others shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and after them shall others come. Then I say, at the end of the world shall the stones be joined to the foundation, living stones, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> stones, that at the end the whole edifice may be built by that Church, yea by this very Church which now sings the new song, while the house is in building. For so the Psalm itself says, <q>When the house was in building after the captivity;</q> and what says it, <q>Sing unto the Lord a new song, sing unto the Lord all the earth.</q>  How great a house is this! But when does it sing the new song? When it is in building. When is it dedicated? At the end of the world. Its foundation has been already dedicated, because He has ascended into heaven, and dies no more. When we too shall have risen to die no more, then shall we be dedicated.</p>
