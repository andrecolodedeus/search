<h1>Sermon 71</h1>

<p> <em>(On the Lord's Resurrection, I.; delivered on Holy Saturday in the Vigil of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. )</em></p>

<h2>I. We must all be partakers in Christ's resurrection life</h2>

<p>In my last sermon , dearly-beloved, not in appropriately, as I think, we explained to you our participation in the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whereby the life of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> contains in itself the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and thus what is honoured at the feast is celebrated by our practice. And how useful this is you yourselves have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, and by your devotion have learned, how greatly benefited <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and bodies are by longer <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, more frequent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and more liberal <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. For there can be hardly any one who has not profited by this exercise, and who has not stored up in the recesses of his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> something over which he may rightly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. But these advantages must be retained with persistent care, lest our efforts fall away into idleness, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> steal what God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> gave. Since, therefore, by our forty days' observance  we have wished to bring about this effect, that we should feel something of the Cross at the time of the Lord's Passion, we must strive to be found partakers also of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Resurrection, and <q>pass from death unto life <span class="stiki" id="note361095"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:14</a></span>,</q> while we are in this body. For when a man is changed by some process from one thing into another, not to be what he was is to him an ending, and to be what he was not is a beginning. But the question is, to what a man either dies or lives: because there is a death, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of living, and there is a life, which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of dying. And nowhere else but in this transitory world are both sought after, so that upon the character of our temporal actions depend the differences of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> retributions. We must die, therefore, to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and live to God: we must perish to iniquity that we may rise to righteousness. Let the old sink, that the new may rise; and since, as says the Truth, <q>no one can serve two masters <span class="stiki" id="note361096"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;6:24</a></span>,</q> let not him be Lord who has caused the overthrow of those that stood, but Him Who has raised the fallen to victory.</p>

<h2>II. God did not leave His soul in hell, nor suffer His flesh to see corruption</h2>

<p>Accordingly, since the Apostle says, <q>the first man is of the earth earthy, the second man is from heaven heavenly. As is the earthy, such also are they that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly. As we have borne the image of the earthy, so let us also bear the image of Him Who is from heaven ,</q> we must greatly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over this change, whereby we are translated from earthly degradation to heavenly dignity through His unspeakable mercy, Who descended into our estate that He might promote us to His, by assuming not only the substance but also the conditions of sinful nature, and by allowing the impassibility of Godhead to be affected by all the miseries which are the lot of mortal manhood. And hence that the disturbed minds of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> might not be racked by prolonged grief, He with such wondrous speed shortened the three days' delay which He had announced, that by joining the last part of the first and the first part of the third day to the whole of the second, He cut off a considerable portion of the period, and yet did not lessen the number of days. The Saviour's Resurrection therefore did not long keep His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in Hades, nor His flesh in the tomb; and so speedy was the quickening of His uncorrupted flesh that it bore a closer resemblance to slumber than to death, seeing that the Godhead, Which quitted not either part of the Human Nature which He had assumed, reunited by Its power that which Its power had separated. </p>

<h2>III. Christ's manifestation after the Resurrection showed that His Person was essentially the same as before</h2>

<p>And then there followed many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, whereon the authority of the Faith to be preached through the whole world might be based. And although the rolling away of the stone, the empty tomb, the arrangement of the linen cloths, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who narrated the whole deed by themselves fully built up the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Lord's Resurrection, yet did He often appear plainly to the eyes both of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and of the Apostles  not only talking with them, but also remaining and eating with them, and allowing Himself to be handled by the eager and curious hands of those whom <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> assailed. For to this end He entered when the doors were closed upon the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and gave them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> by breathing on them, and after giving them the light of understanding opened the secrets of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, and again Himself showed them the wound in the side, the prints of the nails, and all the marks of His most recent Passion, whereby it might be acknowledged that in Him the properties of the Divine and Human Nature remained undivided, and we might in such sort <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Word was not what the flesh is, as to confess God's only Son to be both Word and Flesh.</p>

<h2>IV. But though it is the same, it is also glorified</h2>

<p>The Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, dearly-beloved, does not disagree with this belief, when he says, <q>even though we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ after the flesh, yet now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him so no more. </q> For the Lord's Resurrection was not the ending, but the changing of the flesh, and His substance was not destroyed by His increase of power. The quality altered, but the nature did not cease to exist: the body was made impassible, which it had been possible to crucify: it was made incorruptible, though it had been possible to wound it. And properly is Christ's flesh said not to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in that state in which it had been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, because nothing remained passible in it, nothing weak, so that it was both the same in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and not the same in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But what wonder if S. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> maintains this about Christ's body, when he says of all spiritual <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> <q>wherefore henceforth we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no one after the flesh.</q> Henceforth, he says, we begin to experience the resurrection in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since the time when in Him, Who died for all, all our hopes were guaranteed to us. We do not hesitate in diffidence, we are not under the suspense of uncertainty, but having received an earnest of the promise, we now with the eye of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> see the things which will be, and rejoicing in the uplifting of our nature, we already possess what we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</p>

<h2>V. Being saved by hope, we must not fulfil the lusts of the flesh</h2>

<p>Let us not then be taken up with the appearances of temporal matters, neither let our contemplations be diverted from heavenly to earthly things. Things which as yet have for the most part not come to pass must be reckoned as accomplished: and the mind intent on what is permanent must fix its desires there, where what is offered is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. For although <q>by hope we were saved <span class="stiki" id="note361101"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;8:24</a></span>,</q> and still bear about with us a flesh that is corruptible and mortal, yet we are rightly said not to be in the flesh, if the fleshly affections do not dominate us, and are justified in ceasing to be named after that, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of which we do not follow. And so, when the Apostle says, <q>make not provision for the flesh in the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> thereof <span class="stiki" id="note361102"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;13:14</a></span>,</q> we understand that those things are not forbidden us, which conduce to health and which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness demands, but because we may not satisfy all our desires nor indulge in all that the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> after, we recognize that we are warned to exercise such self-restraint as not to permit what is excessive nor refuse what is necessary to the flesh, which is placed under the mind's control.  And hence the same Apostle says in another place, <q>For no one ever <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it <span class="stiki" id="note361104"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse29">Ephesians&nbsp;5:29</a></span>;</q> in so far, of course, as it must be nourished and cherished not in <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and luxury, but with a view to its proper functions, so that nature may recover herself and maintain due order, the lower parts not prevailing wrongfully and debasingly over the higher, nor the higher yielding to the lower, lest if <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> overpower the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, slavery ensues where there should be supremacy.</p>

<h2>VI. Our godly resolutions must continue all the year round, not be confined to Easter only</h2>

<p>Let God's people then recognize that they are a new creation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and with all vigilance understand by Whom they have been adopted and Whom they have adopted.  Let not the things, which have been made new, return to their ancient instability; and let not him who has <q>put his hand to the plough <span class="stiki" id="note361106"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse62">Luke&nbsp;9:62</a></span> </q> forsake his work, but rather attend to that which he sows than look back to that which he has left behind. Let no one fall back into that from which he has risen, but, even though from bodily weakness he still languishes under certain maladies, let him urgently desire to be healed and raised up. For this is the path of health through imitation of the Resurrection begun in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whereby, notwithstanding the many accidents and falls to which in this slippery life the traveller is liable, his feet may be guided from the quagmire on to solid ground, for, as it is written, <q>the steps of a man are directed by the Lord, and He will delight in his way. When the just man falls he shall not be overthrown, because the Lord will stretch out His hand. </q> These thoughts, dearly-beloved, must be kept in mind not only for the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> festival, but also for the sanctification of the whole life, and to this our present exercise ought to be directed, that what has delighted the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the faithful by the experience of a short observance may pass into a habit and remain unalterably, and if any fault creep in, it may be destroyed by speedy repentance. And because the cure of old-standing diseases is slow and difficult, remedies should be applied early, when the wounds are fresh, so that rising ever anew from all downfalls, we may deserve to attain to the incorruptible Resurrection of our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> flesh in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, Who lives and reigns with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
