<h1>Sermon 71 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[CXXI. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse10">John 1:10</a> <em>, <q>The world was made through him,</q> etc.</em></p>

<p>1. By the Lord <q>was the world made, and the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not.</q>  What world was made by Him, what world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not? For it is not the same world that was made by Him, which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not. What is the world that was made by Him? The heaven and earth. How did not the heaven <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, when at His Passion the sun was darkened? How did not the earth <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, when as He hung upon the Cross, it quaked? But <q>the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not,</q> whose Prince he is, of whom it is said, <q>Behold, the prince of this world comes, and finds nothing in me.</q>  Wicked men are called the world; unbelieving men are called the world. They have gotten their name from that they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. By the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God we are made gods; so by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the world, we are called the world. But <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself.</q>  <q>The world</q> then <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not.</q> What? <q>all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>?</q></p>

<p>2. <q>He came unto His Own, and His Own received Him not.</q>  All things are His, but they are called His Own, from among whom His mother was, among whom He had taken Flesh, to whom He had sent before the heralds of His advent, to whom He had given the law, whom He had delivered from the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> bondage, whose father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> according to the flesh He elected. For He said <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <q>Before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was, I am.</q>  He did not say, <q>Before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was,</q> or <q>before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was made, I was made.</q> For <q>in the beginning the Word was,</q> not, <q>was made.</q> So then <q>He came unto His Own,</q> He came to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. <q>And His Own received Him not.</q></p>

<p>3. <q>But as many as received Him.</q>  For of course the Apostles were there, who <q>received Him.</q> There were they who carried branches before His beast. They went before and followed after, and spread their garments, and cried with a loud voice, <q><a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> to the Son of David, Blessed is He That comes in the Name of the Lord.</q>  Then said the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> unto Him, <q>Restrain the children, that they cry not out so unto You.</q> And He said, <q>If these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.</q>  Us He saw when He spoke these words; <q>If these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.</q> Who are stones, but they who worship stones? If the Jewish children shall hold their peace, the elder and the younger <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> shall cry out. Who are the stones, but they of whom speaks that very John, who came <q>to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the Light</q>?  For when he saw these self-same <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> priding themselves on their birth from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, he said to them, <q>O generation of vipers.</q>  They called themselves the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; and he addressed them, <q>O generation of vipers.</q> Did he do <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> wrong? God forbid! He gave them a name from their character. For that if they were the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, they would imitate <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; as He too tells them who say to Him, <q>We be free, and were never in bondage to any man; we have <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> for our father.</q> And He said, <q>If you were <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> children, you would do the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. You wish to kill Me, because I tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. This did not <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q>  You were of his stock, but you are a degenerate stock. So then what said John? <q>O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> to come?</q> Because they came to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John unto repentance. <q>Who has warned you to flee from the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> to come? Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance. And say not in your hearts, We have <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to our father. For God is able of these stones to raise up children unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q>  For God is able of these stones which he saw in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; to them he spoke; he foresaw us; <q>For God is able of these stones to raise up children unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> Of what stones? <q>If these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.</q> You have just now heard, and cried out. It is fulfilled, <q>The stones shall cry out.</q> For from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> we came, in our forefathers we worshipped stones. Therefore are we called dogs too. Call to mind what that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> heard who cried out after the Lord, for she was a Canaanitish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, a worshipper of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, the handmaid of devils. What said Jesus to her? <q>It is not good to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</q>  Have ye never noticed, how dogs will lick the greasy stones? So are all the worshippers of images. But <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has come to you. <q>But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> See you have here some just now born: to them has He <q>given power to become the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> To whom has He given it? <q>To them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His Name.</q></p>

<p>4. And how do they become the sons of God? <q>Who were born, not of blood, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Having received power to become the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they are born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Mark then: They are born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>not of blood,</q> like their first birth, like that wretched birth, issuing out of wretchedness. But they who are born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what were they? Whereby were they first born? Of blood; of the joint blood of the male and female, of the carnal union of male and female, from this were they born. From whence now? They are born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The first birth of the male and female; the second birth of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>5. Lo, they are born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whereby is it brought to pass that they should be born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who were first born of men? Whereby is it brought to pass, whereby? <q>And the Word was made Flesh, that It might dwell among us.</q>  Wondrous exchange; He made Flesh, they spirit. What is this? What condescension is here, my brethren! Lift up your minds to the hope and comprehension of better things. Give not yourselves up to worldly desires. <q>You have been bought with a Price;</q>  for your sakes the Word was made Flesh; for your sakes He who was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, was made the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>: that you who were the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, might be made sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What was He, what was He made? What were ye, what were ye made? He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. What was He made? The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>. You were the sons of men. What were ye made? The sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He shared with us our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, to give us His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. But even in that He was made the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, He is different much from us. We are the sons of men by the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh; He the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. The mother of any other man whatever conceives by a carnal union; and every one is born of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, his father and his mother. But Christ was born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and the Virgin Mary. He came to us, but from Himself departed not far; yea from Himself as God He departed never; but added what He was to our nature. For He came to that which He was not, He did not lose what He was. He was made the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>; but did not cease to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Hereby the Mediator, in the middle. What is, <q>in the middle</q>? Neither up above, nor down below. How neither up above, nor down below? Not above, since He is Flesh; not below, since He is not a sinner. But yet in so far as He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, above always. For He did not so come to us, as to leave the Father. From us He went, and did not leave us; to us will He come again, and will not leave Him.</p>
