<h1>Sermon 72</h1>

<p> <em>(On the Lord's Resurrection, II.)</em></p>

<h2>I. The Cross is not only the mystery of salvation, but an example to follow</h2>

<p>The whole of the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, dearly-beloved, has been brought before us in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> narrative, and the ears of the mind have been so reached through the ear of flesh that none of you can fail to have a picture of the events: for the text of the Divinely-inspired story has clearly shown the treachery of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ's</a> betrayal, the judgment by which He was condemned, the barbarity of His crucifixion, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. But a sermon is still required of us, that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests'</a> exhortation may be added to the solemn reading of Holy Writ, as I am sure you are with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> expectation demanding of us as your accustomed due. Because therefore there is no place for <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in faithful ears, the seed of the Word which consists of the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, ought to grow in the soil of your heart, so that, when choking thorns and thistles have been removed, the plants of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thoughts and the buds of right desires may spring up freely into fruit. For the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which was set up for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of mortals, is both a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> and an example : a sacrament where by the Divine power takes effect, an example whereby man's devotion is excited: for to those who are rescued from the prisoner's yoke Redemption further procures the power of following the way of the cross by imitation. For if the world's wisdom so prides itself in its <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that every one follows the opinions and habits and whole manner of life of him whom he has chosen as his leader, how shall we share in the name of Christ save by being inseparably united to Him, Who is, as He Himself asserted, <q>the Way, the Truth, and the Life <span class="stiki" id="note361109"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span>?</q> the Way that is of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> living, the Truth of Divine doctrine, and the Life of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.</p>

<h2>II. Christ took our nature upon Him for our salvation</h2>

<p>For when the whole body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> had fallen in our first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, the merciful God purposed so to succour, through His only-begotten <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, His creatures made after His image, that the restoration of our nature should not be effected apart from it, and that our new estate should be an advance upon our original position. Happy, if we had not fallen from that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made us; but happier, if we remain that which He has re-made us. It was much to have received form from Christ; it is more to have a substance in Christ.  For we were taken up into its own proper self by that Nature (which condescended to those limitations which loving-kindness dictated and which yet incurred no sort of change. We were taken up by that Nature ), which destroyed not what was His in what was ours, nor what was ours in what was His; which made the person of the Godhead and of the Manhood so one in Itself that by co-ordination of weakness and power, the flesh could not be rendered inviolable through the Godhead, nor the Godhead passible through the flesh. We were taken up by that Nature, which did not break off the Branch from the common stock of our race, and yet excluded all taint of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which has passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. That is to say, weakness and mortality, which were not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but the penalty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, were undergone by the Redeemer of the World in the way of punishment, that they might be reckoned as the price of redemption. What therefore in all of us is the heritage of condemnation, is in Christ <q>the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of godliness. </q> For being free from debt, He gave Himself up to that most cruel creditor, and suffered the hands of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> agents in torturing His spotless flesh. Which flesh He willed to be subject to death, even up to His (speedy)  resurrection, to this end, that <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in Him might find neither <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> intolerable, nor death terrible, by the remembrance that there was no more <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about their sharing His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> than there was about His sharing their nature.</p>

<h2>III. The presence of the risen and ascended Lord is still with us</h2>

<p>And so, dearly-beloved, if we unhesitatingly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> with the heart what we profess with the mouth, in Christ we are crucified, we are dead, we are buried; on the very third day, too, we are raised. Hence the Apostle says, <q>If you have risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting on God's right hand: set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth. For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For when Christ, your life, shall have appeared, then shall you also appear with Him in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> <span class="stiki" id="note361114"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse1">Colossians&nbsp;3:1-4</a></span> .</q> But that the hearts of the faithful may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they have that whereby to spurn the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the world and be lifted to the wisdom that is above, the Lord promises us His presence, saying, <q>Lo! I am with you all the days, even till the end of the age <span class="stiki" id="note361115"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;28:20</a></span> .</q> For not in vain had the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> said by Isaiah: <q>Behold! A <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive and shall bear a Son, and they shall call His name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, which is, being interpreted, God with us. </q> Jesus, therefore, fulfils the proper meaning of His name, and in ascending into the heavens does not forsake His adopted brethren, though <q>He sits at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> yet dwells in the whole body, and Himself from above strengthens them for patient waiting while He summons them upwards to His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<h2>IV. We must have the same mind as was in Christ Jesus</h2>

<p>We must not, therefore, indulge in folly amid vain pursuits, nor give way to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in the midst of adversities. On the one side, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, we are flattered by deceits, and on the other weighed down by troubles; but because <q>the earth is full of the mercy of the Lord ,</q> Christ's victory is assuredly ours, that what He says may be fulfilled, <q>Fear not, for I have overcome the world <span class="stiki" id="note361118"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;16:33</a></span> .</q> Whether, then, we fight against the ambition of the world, or against the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the flesh, or against the darts of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, let us arm ourselves always with the Lord's Cross. For our Paschal feast will never end, if we abstain from the leaven of the old <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> (in the sincerity of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> ). For amid all the changes of this life which is full of various afflictions, we ought to remember the Apostle's exhortation; whereby he instructs us, saying, <q>Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus: Who being in the form of God counted it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, being made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and found in fashion as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Wherefore God also exalted Him, and gave Him a name which is above every name, that in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> every knee should bow of things in heaven, of things on earth, and of things below, and that every tongue should confess that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father <span class="stiki" id="note361120"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse5">Philippians&nbsp;2:5-11</a></span> .</q> If, he says, you understand <q>the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of great godliness,</q> and remember what the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> did for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, <q>have that mind in you which was also in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>,</q> Whose humility is not to be scorned by any of the rich, not to be thought shame of by any of the high-born. For no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> whatever can reach so great a height as to reckon it a source of shame to himself that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, abiding in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thought it not unworthy of Himself to take the form of a slave.</p>

<h2>V. Only he who holds the truth on the Incarnation can keep Easter properly</h2>

<p>Imitate what He wrought: <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what He loved, and finding in you the Grace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in Him your nature in return, since as He was not dispossessed of riches in poverty, lessened not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in humility, lost not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in death, so do ye, too, treading in His footsteps, despise earthly things that you may gain heavenly: for the taking up of the cross means the slaying of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, the killing of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, the turning away from vanity, and the renunciation of all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For, though the Lord's <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> can be kept by no immodest, self-indulgent, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, or miserly person, yet none are held so far aloof from this festival as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and especially those who have wrong views on the Incarnation of the Word, either disparaging what belongs to the Godhead or treating what is of the flesh as unreal. For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having from the Father all that the Father is, with no beginning in time, subject to no sort of change, undivided from the One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not different from the Almighty, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Only-begotten of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Father; so that the faithful <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> believing in the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the one Godhead, neither divides the Unity by suggesting degrees of dignity, nor confounds the Trinity by merging the Persons in one. But it is not enough to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in the Father's nature only, unless we acknowledge Him in what is ours without withdrawal of what is His own. For that self-emptying, which He underwent for man's restoration, was the dispensation of compassion, not the loss of power.  For, though by the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> purpose of God there was <q>no other name under heaven given to men whereby they must be saved <span class="stiki" id="note361122"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse12">Acts&nbsp;4:12</a></span>,</q> the Invisible made His substance visible, the Intemporal temporal, the Impassible passible: not that power might sink into weakness, but that weakness might pass into indestructible power.</p>

<h2>VI. A mystical application of the term <q>Passover</q> is given</h2>

<p>For which reason the very feast which by us is named <em>Pascha</em>, among the Hebrews is called <em>Phase</em>, that is Pass-over , as the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> attests, saying, <q>Before the feast of Pascha, Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that His hour had come that He should pass out of this world unto the Father. </q> But what was the nature in which He thus passed out unless it was ours, since the Father was in the Son and the Son in the Father inseparably? But because the Word and the Flesh is one Person, the Assumed is not separated from the Assuming nature, and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of being promoted is spoken of as accruing to Him that promotes, as the Apostle says in a passage we have already quoted, <q>Wherefore also God exalted Him and gave Him a name which is above every name.</q> Where the exaltation of His assumed Manhood is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> spoken of, so that He in Whose sufferings the Godhead remains indivisible is likewise coeternal in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Godhead. And to share in this unspeakable gift the Lord Himself was preparing a blessed <q>passing over</q> for His faithful ones, when on the very threshold of His Passion he interceded not only for His Apostles and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> but also for the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, saying, <q>But not for these only I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, but for those also who shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Me through their word, that they all may be one, as You also, Father, art in Me, and I in You, that they also may be one in us <span class="stiki" id="note361125"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse20">John&nbsp;17:20-21</a></span> .</q></p>

<h2>VII. Only true believers can keep the Easter Festival</h2>

<p>In this union they can have no share who deny that in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Himself <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, man's nature abides, assailing the health-giving <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> and shutting themselves out from the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> festival. For, as they dissent from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and gainsay the creed, they cannot keep it with us, because although they dare to take to themselves the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name, yet they are repelled by every creature who has Christ for his Head: for you rightly exult and devoutly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in this sacred season as those who, admitting no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> into the Truth, have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about Christ's Birth according to the flesh, His Passion and Death, and the Resurrection of His body: inasmuch as without any separation of the Godhead you acknowledge a Christ, Who was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born of a Virgin's womb, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> hung on the wood of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> laid in an earthly tomb, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> raised in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> set on the right hand of the Father's majesty; <q>whence also,</q> as the Apostle says, <q>we look for a Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. Who shall refashion the body of our humility to become conformed to the body of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> <span class="stiki" id="note361126"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse20">Philippians&nbsp;3:20-21</a></span> .</q> Who lives and reigns, etc.</p>
