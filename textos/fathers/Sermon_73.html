<h1>Sermon 73</h1>

<p> <em>(On the Lord's Ascension, I.)</em></p>

<h2>I. The events recorded as happening after the Resurrection were intended to convince us of its truth</h2>

<p>Since the blessed and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, whereby the Divine power in three days raised the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had overthrown, the sacred forty days, dearly-beloved, are today ended, which by most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> appointment were devoted to our most profitable instruction, so that, during the period that the Lord thus protracted the lingering of His bodily presence, our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Resurrection might be fortified by needful <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>. For Christ's Death had much disturbed the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples'</a> hearts, and a kind of torpor of distrust had crept over their grief-laden minds at His torture on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, at His giving up the ghost, at His lifeless body's burial. For, when the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, as the Gospel-story has revealed, brought word of the stone rolled away from the tomb, the sepulchre emptied of the body, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the living Lord, their words seemed like ravings to the Apostles and other <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Which doubtfulness, the result of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, the Spirit of Truth would most assuredly not have permitted to exist in His own preacher's breasts, had not their trembling anxiety and careful hesitation laid the foundations of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It was our perplexities and our dangers that were provided for in the Apostles: it was ourselves who in these men were taught how to meet the cavillings of the ungodly and the arguments of earthly wisdom. <em>We</em> are instructed by their lookings, <em>we</em> are taught by their hearings, <em>we</em> are convinced by their handlings. Let us give thanks to the Divine management and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Father.' necessary slowness of belief. Others <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>, that we might not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>.</p>

<h2>II. And therefore they are in the highest degree instructive</h2>

<p>Those days, therefore, dearly-beloved, which intervened between the Lord's Resurrection and Ascension did not pass by in uneventful leisure, but great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>  were ratified in them, deep truths  revealed. In them the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of awful death was removed, and the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> not only of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but also of the flesh established. In them, through the Lord's breathing upon them, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is poured upon all the Apostles, and to the blessed Apostle Peter beyond the rest the care of the Lord's flock is entrusted, in addition to the keys of the kingdom. Then it was that the Lord joined the two <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> as a companion on the way, and, to the sweeping away of all the clouds of our uncertainty, upbraided them with the slowness of their timorous hearts. Their enlightened hearts catch the flame of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and lukewarm as they have been, are made to burn while the Lord unfolds the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. In the breaking of bread also their eyes are opened as they eat with Him: how far more blessed is the opening of their eyes, to whom the glorification of their nature is revealed than that of our first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, on whom fell the disastrous consequences of their transgression.</p>

<h2>III. They prove the Resurrection of the flesh</h2>

<p>And in the course of these and other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were harassed by bewildering thoughts, and the Lord had appeared in their midst and said, <q>Peace be unto you ,</q> that what was passing through their hearts might not be their fixed opinion (for they thought they saw a spirit not flesh), He refutes their thoughts so discordant with the Truth, offers to the doubters' eyes the marks of the cross that remained in His hands and feet, and invites them to handle Him with careful scrutiny, because the traces of the nails and spear had been retained to heal the wounds of unbelieving hearts, so that not with wavering <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but with most steadfast <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> they might comprehend that the Nature which had been lain in the sepulchre was to sit on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father's throne.</p>

<h2>IV. Christ's ascension has given us greater privileges and joys than the devil had taken from us</h2>

<p>Accordingly, dearly-beloved, throughout this time which elapsed between the Lord's Resurrection and Ascension, God's Providence had this in view, to teach and impress upon both the eyes and hearts of His own people that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> might be acknowledged to have as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> risen, as He was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born, suffered, and died. And hence the most blessed Apostles and all the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who had been both bewildered at His death on the cross and backward in believing His Resurrection, were so strengthened by the clearness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that when the Lord entered the heights of heaven, not only were they affected with no sadness, but were even filled with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> great and unspeakable was their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, when in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> multitude, above the dignity of all heavenly creatures, the Nature of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> went up, to pass above the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels'</a> ranks and to rise beyond the archangels' heights, and to have Its uplifting limited by no elevation until, received to sit with the Eternal Father, It should be associated on the throne with His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, to Whose Nature It was united in the Son. Since then Christ's Ascension is our uplifting, and the hope of the Body is raised, whither the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Head has gone before, let us exult, dearly-beloved, with worthy <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and delight in the loyal paying of thanks. For today not only are we confirmed as possessors of paradise, but have also in Christ penetrated the heights of heaven, and have gained still greater things through Christ's unspeakable <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than we had lost through the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. For us, whom our virulent enemy had driven out from the bliss of our first abode, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has made members of Himself and placed at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, with Whom He lives and reigns in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, God for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
