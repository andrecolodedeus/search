<h1>Sermon 73 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[CXXIII. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse2">John 2:2</a> <em>, <q>and Jesus also was bidden, and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, to the marriage.</q></em></p>

<p>1. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, Brethren, for you have learned it as believing in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and continually too do we by our ministry impress it upon you, that the humility of Christ is the medicine of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> swollen <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For man would not have perished, had he not been swollen up through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For <q><a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>,</q> as says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>is the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q>  Against the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the beginning of righteousness was necessary. If then <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> be the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereby should the swelling of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> be cured, had not God vouchsafed to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> Himself? Let man blush to be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, seeing that God has humbled Himself. For when man is told to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> himself, he disdains it; and when men are injured, it is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> that makes them wish to be avenged. Forasmuch as they disdain to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> themselves, they wish to be avenged; as if another's punishment could be any profit to any man. One who has been hurt and suffered wrong wishes to be avenged; he seeks his own remedy from another's punishment, and gains a great torment. The Lord Christ therefore vouchsafed to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> Himself in all things, showing us the way; if we but think meet to walk thereby.</p>

<p>2. Among His other acts, lo, the Virgin's Son comes to the marriage; who being with the Father instituted marriage. As the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, by whom came <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, was made of a man without a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; so the Man by whom <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was done away, was made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> without a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. By the first we fell, by the other we rise. And what did He at this marriage? Of water He made wine. What greater sign of power? He who had power to do such things, vouchsafed to be in need. He who made of water wine could also have of stones made bread. The power was the same; but then the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> tempted Him, therefore Christ did it not. For you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that when the Lord Christ was tempted, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> suggested this to Him. For He was an hungred, since this too He vouchsafed to be, since this too made part of His Humiliation. The Bread was hungry, as the Way fainted, as saving Health was wounded, as the Life died. When then He was an hungred as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, the tempter said to Him, <q>If Thou be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, command that these stones be made bread.</q>  And He made answer to the tempter, teaching you to answer the tempter. For to this end does the general fight, that the soldiers may learn. What answer did He make? <q>Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  And He did not make bread of the stones, who of course could as easily have done it, as He made of water wine. For it is an exercise of the same power to make bread of stone; but He did it not, that He might despise the tempter's will. For no otherwise is the tempter overcome, but by being despised. And when He had overcome the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, <q>Angels came and ministered to Him.</q>  He then who had so great power, why did He not do the one, and do the other? Read, yea, recollect what you have just heard, when He did this, when, that is, He made of the water wine; what did the Evangelist add? <q>And His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him.</q>  Would the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> on the other occasion have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him?</p>

<p>3. He then who could do so great things, was hungry, and thirsty, was wearied, slept, was apprehended, beaten, crucified, slain. This is the way; walk by humility, that you may come to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Christ-God is the Country whither we go; Christ-Man is the Way whereby we go. To Him we go, by Him we go; why <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> we lest we go astray? He departed not from the Father; and came to us. He sucked the breasts, and He contained the world. He lay in the <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>, and He fed the Angels. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a>, the same God who is Man, the same Man who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But not God in that wherein He is Man, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in that He is the Word; Man, in that the Word was made Flesh; by at once continuing to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by assuming man's Flesh; by adding what He was not, not losing what He was. Therefore henceforward, having now suffered in this His humiliation, dead, and buried, He has now risen again, and ascended into heaven, there He is, and sits at the right Hand of the Father: and here He is needy in His poor. Yesterday too I set this forth to your Affection by occasion of what He said to Nathanael, <q>You shall see a greater thing than this. For I say unto you, You shall see <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> open, and the Angels of God ascending and descending unto the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>.</q>  We searched out what this meant, and spoke at some length; must we recapitulate the same today? Let those who were present remember; yet I will briefly run over it.</p>

<p>4. He would not say, <q>ascending unto the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>,</q> unless He were above; He would not say, <q>descending unto the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>,</q> unless He were also below. He is at once above, and below; above in Himself, below in His; above with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, below in us. Whence also was that Voice to Saul, <q>Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?</q>  He would not say, <q>Saul, Saul,</q> unless that He was above. But Saul was not <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> Him above. He then who was above would not have said, <q>Why do you persecute me?</q> unless He were below also. Fear Christ above; recognise Him below. Have Christ above bestowing His bounty, recognise Him here in need. Here He is poor, there He is rich. That Christ is poor here, He tells us Himself for me, <q>I was an hungred, I was thirsty, I was naked, I was a stranger, I was in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.</q>  And to some He said, <q>You have ministered unto Me,</q> and to some He said, <q>You have not ministered unto Me.</q> Lo, we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> Christ poor; that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is Rich, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not? And even here it was a property of these riches to turn the water into wine. If he who has wine is rich, how rich is He who makes wine? So then Christ is rich and poor; as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, rich; as Man, poor. Yea rich too now as Very Man He has ascended into heaven, sits at the right Hand of the Father; yet still He is poor and hungry here, thirsty, and naked.</p>

<p>5. What are you? Rich, or poor? Many tell me, I am poor; and they tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. I recognise some poor having something, and some having want. But some have much gold and silver. O that they would acknowledge themselves poor! Poor they will acknowledge themselves, if they acknowledge the poor about them. For how is it? How much soever you have, you rich man whosoever you are, you are God's beggar. The hour of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> comes, and there I prove you. You make your petition. How are you not poor, who makest your petition? I say more, You make petition for bread. Will you not have to say, <q>Give us our daily bread</q>?  Thou, who ask for daily bread, are you poor, or rich? And yet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> says to you, <q>Give Me of that which I have given you. For what did you bring here, when you came hither? All things that I created, yourself created hast found here; nothing did you bring, nothing shall you take away. Why will you not give Me of Mine Own? For you are full, and the poor man is empty. Look at your first origin; naked were ye both born. Thou too then wast born naked. Great store have you found here; did you bring ought with you? I ask for Mine Own; give, and I will repay. You have found Me a bountiful giver, make Me at once your debtor. It is not enough to say, 'You have found Me a bountiful giver, make Me at once your debtor;' let Me regard you as lending upon interest. You give me but little, I will repay more. You give me earthly things, I will repay heavenly. You give me temporal things, I will restore <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. I will restore you to yourself, when I shall have restored you unto Me.</q></p>
