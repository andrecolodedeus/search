<h1>Sermon 82</h1>

<p> <em>On the Feast  of the Apostles Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> (June 29).</em></p>

<h2>I. Rome owes its high position to these Apostles</h2>

<p>The whole world, dearly-beloved, does indeed take part in all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> anniversaries, and loyalty to the one Faith demands that whatever is recorded as done for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> should be everywhere celebrated with common rejoicings. But, besides that reverence which today's festival has gained from all the world, it is to be honoured with special and peculiar exultation in our city, that there may be a predominance of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> on the day of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in the place where the chief of the Apostles met their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> end.  For these are the men, through whom the light of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> gospel shone on you, O Rome, and through whom you, who wast the teacher of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, wast made the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Truth. These are your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> shepherds, who gave you claims to be numbered among the heavenly kingdoms, and built you under much better and happier auspices than they, by whose <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> the first foundations of your walls were laid: and of whom the one that gave you your name defiled you with his brother's blood.  These are they who promoted you to such <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that being made a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation, a chosen people, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> and royal state <span class="stiki" id="note361168"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:9</a></span>, and the head of the world through the blessed Peter's <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">holy See</a> you attained a wider sway by the worship of God than by earthly government. For although you were increased by many victories, and extended your rule on land and sea, yet what your toils in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> subdued is less than what the peace of Christ has conquered.</p>

<h2>II. The extension of the Roman empire was part of the Divine scheme</h2>

<p>For the good, just, and Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who has never withheld His mercy from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and has ever instructed all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> alike in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself by the most abundant benefits, has by a more secret counsel and a deeper <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> shown pity upon the wanderers' <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> blindness and proclivities to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, by sending His co-equal and co-eternal Word. Which becoming flesh so united the Divine Nature with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> that He by lowering His Nature to the uttermost has raised our nature to the highest. But that the result of this unspeakable Grace might be spread abroad throughout the world, God's Providence made ready the Roman empire, whose growth has reached such limits that the whole multitude of nations are brought into close connection. For the Divinely-planned work particularly required that many kingdoms should be leagued together under one empire, so that the preaching of the world might quickly reach to all people, when they were held beneath the rule of one state. And yet that state, in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the Author of its aggrandisement though it rule almost all nations, was enthralled by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of them all, and seemed to itself to have fostered religion greatly, because it rejected no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. And hence its emancipation through Christ was the more wondrous that it had been so fast bound by <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>.</p>

<h2>III. On the dispersing of the Twelve, St. Peter was sent to Rome</h2>

<p>For when the twelve Apostles, after receiving through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> the power of speaking with all tongues, had distributed the world into parts among themselves, and undertaken to instruct it in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, the most blessed Peter, chief of the Apostolic band, was appointed to the citadel of the Roman empire, that the light of Truth which was being displayed for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, might spread itself more effectively throughout the body of the world from the head itself. What nation had not representatives then living in this city; or what peoples did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what Rome had learned? Here it was that the tenets of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> must be crushed, here that the follies of earthly wisdom must be dispelled, here that the cult of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> must be refuted, here that the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of all idolatries must be rooted out, here where the most persistent <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> had gathered together all the various <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which had anywhere been devised.</p>

<h2>IV. St. Peter's love conquered his fears in coming to Rome</h2>

<p>To this city then, most blessed Apostle Peter, you dost not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to come, and when the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, the partner of your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, was still busied with regulating other churches, entered this forest of roaring beasts, this deep, stormy ocean with greater boldness than when you walked upon the sea. And you who had been frightened by the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest's</a> maid in the house of <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, had no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of Rome the mistress of the world. Was there any less power in Claudius, any less cruelty in <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> than in the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> or the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews'</a> savage rage? So then it was the force of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that conquered the reasons for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: and you did not think those to be feared whom you had undertaken to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. But this feeling of fearless affection you had even then surely conceived when the profession of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the Lord was confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the thrice-repeated question. And nothing else was demanded of this your earnest purpose than that you should bestow the food wherewith you had yourself been enriched, on feeding His sheep whom you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>.</p>

<h2>V. St. Peter was providentially prepared for his great mission</h2>

<p>Your confidence also was increased by many miraculous signs, by many gifts of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, by many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of power. You had already taught the people, who from the number of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: you had already founded the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, where first the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name arose: you had already instructed <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Gospel-message: and, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the success of the work, with full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the short span of your life carried the trophy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> cross into the citadel of Rome, whither by the Divine fore-ordaining there accompanied you the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of great power and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of much suffering.</p>

<h2>VI. Many noble martyrs have sprung from the blood of SS. Peter and Paul</h2>

<p>Thither came also your blessed brother-<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, <q>the vessel of election <span class="stiki" id="note361169"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;9:15</a></span>,</q> and the special teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and was associated with you at a time when all innocence, all modesty, all freedom was in jeopardy under <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> rule. Whose fury, inflamed by excess of all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, hurled him headlong into such a fiery furnace of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> that he was the first to assail the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name with a general <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, as if God's Grace could be quenched by the death of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, whose greatest gain it was to win <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> by contempt of this fleeting life. <q>Precious,</q> therefore, <q>in the eyes of the Lord is the death of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> :</q> nor can any degree of cruelty destroy the religion which is founded on the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> cross. Persecution does not diminish but increase the church, and the Lord's field is clothed with an ever richer crop, while the grains, which fall singly, spring up and are multiplied a hundred-fold.  Hence how large a progeny have sprung from these two Heaven-sown seeds is shown by the thousands of blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, who, rivalling the Apostles' triumphs, have traversed the city far and wide in purple-clad and ruddy-gleaming throngs, and crowned it, as it were with a single diadem of countless gems.</p>

<h2>VII. No distinction must be drawn between the merits of the two</h2>

<p>And over this band, dearly-beloved, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has set forth for our example in patience and for our confirmation in the Faith, there must be rejoicing everywhere in the commemoration of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but of these two Father.' excellence we must rightly make our boast in louder <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, for God's Grace has raised them to so high a place among the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that He has set them like the twin light of the eyes in the body, whose Head is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. About their merits and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, which pass all power of speech, we must not make distinctions, because they were equal in their election , alike in their toils, undivided in their death. But as we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> for ourselves, and our forefathers maintained, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and are sure that, amid all the toils of this life, we must always be assisted in obtaining God's Mercy by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of special interceders, that we may be raised by the Apostles' merits in proportion as we are weighed down by our own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, etc.</p>
