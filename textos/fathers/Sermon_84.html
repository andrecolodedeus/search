<h1>Sermon 84</h1>

<p> <em>Concerning the Neglect of the Commemoration.</em></p>

<h2>I. The Churchmen of Rome are in danger of forgetting past judgments and mercies, and becoming ungrateful to God</h2>

<p>The fewness of those who were present has of itself shown, dearly-beloved, that the religious devotion wherewith, in commemoration of the day of our chastisement and release, the whole body of the faithful used to flock together in order to give God thanks, has on this last occasion been almost entirely neglected: and this has caused me much sadness of heart and great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For there is much danger of men becoming ungrateful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and through forgetfulness of His benefits not feeling sorrow for the chastisement, nor <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> for the liberation. Accordingly I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, dearly-beloved, lest that utterance of the Prophet be addressed in rebuke to such men, which says, <q>you have scourged them and they have not grieved: you have chastised them, and they have refused to receive correction. <span class="stiki" id="note361174"><a href="../bible/jer005.htm#verse3">Jeremiah&nbsp;5:3</a></span> </q> For what amendment is shown by them in whom such aversion to God's service is found? One is ashamed to say it, but one must not keep silence: more is spent upon <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> than upon the Apostles, and mad spectacles draw greater crowds than blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>.  Who was it that restored this city to safety? That rescued it from captivity? The games of the circus-goers or the care of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>? Surely it was by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that the sentence of Divine displeasure was diverted, so that we who deserved <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, were reserved for pardon.</p>

<h2>II. Let them avail themselves betimes of God's long-suffering and return to Him</h2>

<p>I entreat you, beloved, let those words of the Saviour touch your hearts, Who, when by the power of His mercy He had cleansed ten <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, said that only one of them all had returned to give thanks <span class="stiki" id="note361176"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;17:18</a></span>: meaning without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that, though the ungrateful ones had gained soundness of body, yet their failure in this godly duty arose from ungodliness of heart. And therefore, dearly-beloved, that this brand of ingratitude may not be applied to you, return to the Lord, remembering the marvels which He has deigned to perform among us; and ascribing our release not, as the ungodly suppose, to the influences of the stars, but to the unspeakable mercy of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who has deigned to soften the hearts of raging barbarians, betake yourselves to the commemoration of so great a benefit with all the vigour of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Grave neglect must be atoned for by yet greater tokens of repentance. Let us use the Mercy of Him, Who has spared us, to our own amendment, that the blessed Peter and all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, who have always been near us in many afflictions, may deign to aid our entreaties for you to the merciful <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
