<h1>Sermon 84 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[CXXXIV. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse31">John 8:31</a> <em>, <q>If you abide in my word, then are you <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,</q> etc.</em></p>

<p>1. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well, Beloved, that we all have One Master, and are fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> under Him. Nor are we your masters, because we speak to you from this higher spot; but He is the Master of all, who dwells in us all. He just now spoke to us all in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and said to us, what I also am saying to you; but He says it of us, as well of us as of you. <q>If you shall continue in My word,</q> not of course in my word who am now speaking to you; but in His who spoke just now out of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. <q>If you shall continue in My word,</q> says He, <q>you are My <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> indeed.</q>  To be a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, it is not enough to come, but to continue. He does not therefore say, <q>If you shall hear My word;</q> or, <q>If you shall come to My word;</q> or, <q>If you shall praise My word;</q> but observe what He said, <q>If you shall continue in My word, you are My <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> indeed, and you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall free you.</q>  What shall we say, Brethren? To continue in the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is it toilsome, or is it not? If it be toilsome, look at the great reward; if it be not toilsome, you receive the reward for nought. Continue we then in Him who continues in us. We, if we continue not in Him, fall; but He if He continue not in us, has not on that account lost an habitation. For He skills to continue in Himself, who never leaves Himself. But for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, God forbid that he should continue in himself who has lost himself. So then we continue in Him through indigence; He continues in us through mercy.</p>

<p>2. Now then seeing it has been set forth what we ought to do, let us see what we are to receive. For He has appointed a work, and promised a reward. What is the work? <q>If you shall continue in Me.</q> A short work; short in description, great in execution. <q>If you shall build on the Rock.</q>  O how great a thing is this, Brethren, to build on the Rock, how great is it! <q>The floods came, the winds blew, the rain descended, and beat upon that house, and it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock.</q>  What then is to continue in the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not to yield to any <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>? The reward, what is it? <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall free you.</q> Bear with me, for you perceive that my voice is feeble;  assist me by your calm  attention. Glorious reward! <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> Here one may haply say, <q>And what does it profit me to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?</q> <q>And the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall free you.</q> If the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> have no charms for you, let freedom have its charms. In the usage of the Latin tongue, the expression, <q>to be free,</q> is used in two senses; and chiefly we are accustomed to hear this word in this sense, that whosoever is free may be understood to escape some danger, to be rid of some embarrassment. But the proper signification of <q>to be free,</q> is <q>to be made free;</q> just as <q>to be saved,</q> is <q>to be made safe;</q> <q>to be healed,</q> is, <q>to be made whole;</q> so <q>to be freed,</q> is <q>to be made free.</q> Therefore I said, <q>If the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> have no charms for you, let freedom have its charms.</q> This is expressed more evidently in the Greek language, nor can it be there understood in any other sense. And that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in no other sense can it be understood; when the Lord spoke, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answered, <q>We were never in bondage to any man; how do you say the Truth shall free you?</q>  That is, <q>the Truth shall make you free,</q> how do you say to us, who were never in bondage to any man? <q>How,</q> say they, <q>do You promise them freedom, who as You see never bare the hard yoke of bondage?</q></p>

<p>3. They heard what they ought; but they did not what they ought. What did they hear? Because I said, <q>The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall free you;</q> ye turned your thoughts upon yourselves, that you are not in bondage to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and you said, <q>We were never in bondage to any man. Every one,</q> Jew and Greek, rich and poor, the man in authority and private station, the emperor and the beggar, <q>Every one that commits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q>  <q>Every one,</q> says He, <q>that commits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> If men but acknowledge their bondage, they will see from whence they may obtain freedom. Some free-born man has been taken captive by the barbarians, from a free man is made a slave; another hears, and pities him, considers how that he has money, becomes his ransomer, goes to the barbarians, gives money, ransoms the man. And he has indeed restored freedom, if he have taken away iniquity. But what man has ever taken away iniquity from another man? He who was in bondage with the barbarians, has been redeemed by his ransomer; and great difference there is between the ransomer and the ransomed; yet haply are they fellow-slaves under the lordship of iniquity. I ask him that was ransomed, <q>Have you <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?</q> <q>I have,</q> he says. I ask the ransomer, <q>Have you <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?</q> <q>I have,</q> he says. So then neither do you boast yourself that you have been ransomed, nor you uplift yourself that you are his ransomer; but fly both of you to the True Deliverer. It is but a small part of it, that they who are under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are called servants; they are even called dead; what a man is afraid of captivity bringing upon him, iniquity has brought on him already. For what? Because they seem to be alive, was He then mistaken who said, <q>Let the dead bury their dead</q>?  So then all under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are dead, dead servants, dead in their service, servants in their death.</p>

<p>4. Who then frees from death and from bondage, save He, who is <q>Free among the dead</q>?  Who is <q>Free among the dead,</q> save He who among sinners is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? <q>Lo, the prince of the world comes,</q> says our Redeemer Himself, our Deliverer, <q>Lo, the prince of the world comes, and shall find nothing in Me.</q>  He holds fast those whom he has deceived, whom he has seduced, whom he has persuaded to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death; <q>in Me shall he find nothing.</q> Come, Lord, Redeemer come, come; let the captive acknowledge you, him that leads captive flee you; be my Deliverer. Lost as I was, He has found me in Whom the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> finds nothing that comes of the flesh. The prince of this world finds in Him Flesh, he finds it but what kind of Flesh? A mortal Flesh, which he can seize, which he can crucify, which he can kill. You are mistaken, O deceiver, the Redeemer is not deceived; you are mistaken. You see in the Lord a mortal Flesh, it is not flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is the likeness of flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <q>For God sent His Son in the likeness of flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> True Flesh, mortal Flesh; but not flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <q>For God sent His Son in the likeness of flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> He might condemn <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the Flesh.</q>  <q>For God sent His Son in the likeness of flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q> in Flesh, but not in flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but <q>in the likeness of flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> For what purpose? <q>That by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> of which assuredly there was none in Him, <q>He might condemn <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh; that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</q> </p>

<p>5. If then it was <q>the likeness of flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> not flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, how, <q>That by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> He might condemn <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh</q>? So a likeness is wont to receive the name of that thing of which it is a likeness. The word man is used for a real man; but if you show a man painted on the wall, and enquire what it is, it is answered, <q>A man.</q> So then Flesh having the likeness of flesh of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that it might be a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is called <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> The same Apostle says in another place, <q>He made Him to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for us, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q>  <q>Him who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>:</q> Who is He who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but He That said, <q>Behold the prince of the world comes, and shall find nothing in me?  Him who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, made He <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for us;</q> even Christ Himself, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, God made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for us. What does this mean, Brethren? If it were said, <q>He made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> upon Him,</q> or, <q>He made Him to have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q> it would seem intolerable; how do we tolerate what is said, <q>He made Him <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> that Christ Himself should be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? They who are acquainted with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> recognise what I am saying. For it is not an expression once used, but repeatedly, very constantly, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are called <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> A goat, for instance, was offered for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, a ram, anything; the victim itself which was offered for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was called <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> A <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> then was called <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q> so that in one place the Law says, <q>That the Priests are to lay their hands upon the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q>  <q>Him</q> then, <q>who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for us;</q> that is, <q>He was made a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> Sin was offered, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was cancelled. The Blood of the Redeemer was shed, and the debtor's bond was cancelled. This is the <q>Blood, That was shed for many for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> </p>

<p>6. What means this then your senseless exultation, O you that held me captive, for that my Deliverer had mortal Flesh? See, if He had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; if you have found anything of yours in Him, hold Him fast. <q>The Word was made Flesh.</q>  The Word is the Creator, the Flesh His creature. What is there here of yours, O enemy? And the Word is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and His Human  Soul is His creature, and His Human Flesh His creature, and the Mortal Flesh of God is His creature. Seek for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> here. But what are you seeking? The Truth says, <q>The prince of this world shall come, and shall find nothing in Me.</q>  He did not therefore not find Flesh, but nothing of his own, that is, no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. You deceived the innocent, you made them guilty. You slew the Innocent; you destroyed Him from whom you had nothing due, render back what you held fast. Why then did you exult for a short hour, because you found in Christ mortal Flesh? It was your trap: whereupon you rejoiced, thereby have you been taken. Wherein you exulted that you had found something, therein you sorrow now that you have lost what you possessed. Therefore, brethren, let us who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, continue in His word. For if we shall continue in His word, we are His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> indeed. For not those twelve only, but all we who continue in His word are His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> indeed. And <q>we shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Truth, and the Truth shall free us;</q> that is, Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> who has said, <q>I am the Truth,</q>  shall make you free, that is, shall free you, not from barbarians, but from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; not from the captivity of the body, but from the iniquity of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. It is He Only who frees in such wise. Let no one call himself free, lest he remain a slave. Our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall not remain in bondage, for that day by day our debts are forgiven.</p>
