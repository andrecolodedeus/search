<h1>Sermon 85</h1>

<p> <em>On the Feast of S. Laurence the Martyr  (Aug. 10).</em></p>

<h2>I. The example of the martyrs is most valuable</h2>

<p>Whilst the height of all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, dearly-beloved, and the fullness of all righteousness is born of that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, wherewith God and one's neighbour is loved, surely in none is this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> found more conspicuous and brighter than in the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; who are as near to our Lord Jesus, Who died for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in the imitation of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, as in the likeness of their suffering. For, although that Love, wherewith the Lord has redeemed us, cannot be equalled by any man's kindness, because it is one thing that a man who is doomed to die one day should die for a righteous man, and another that One Who is free from the debt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should lay down His life for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <span class="stiki" id="note361178"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;5:7-8</a></span>: yet the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> also have done great service to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in that the Lord Who gave them boldness, has used it to show that the penalty of death and the pain of the cross need not be terrible to any of His followers, but might be imitated by many of them. If therefore no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for himself alone, and no wise man's wisdom befriends himself only, and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is such that it leads many away from the dark <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> on which its light is shed, no model is more useful in teaching God's people than that of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Eloquence may make intercession easy, reasoning may effectually persuade; but yet examples are stronger than words, and there is more teaching in practice than in precept.</p>

<h2>II. The Saint's martyrdom described</h2>

<p>And how <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> strong in this most excellent manner of doctrine the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Laurentius is, by whose sufferings today is marked, even his persecutors were able to feel, when they found that his wondrous <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, born principally of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not only did not yield itself, but also strengthened others by the example of his endurance. For when the fury of the gentile potentates was raging against Christ's most chosen members, and attacked those especially who were of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> rank, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> persecutor's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> was vented on Laurentius the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, who was pre-eminent not only in the performance of the sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, but also in the management of the church's property , promising himself double spoil from one man's capture: for if he forced him to surrender the sacred treasures, he would also drive him out of the pale of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. And so this man, so greedy of money and such a foe to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, arms himself with double weapon: with <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> to plunder the gold; with impiety to carry off Christ. He demands of the guileless guardian of the sanctuary that the church <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> on which his greedy mind was set should be brought to him. But the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> showed him where he had them stored, by pointing to the many troops of poor <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in the feeding and clothing of whom he had a store of riches which he could not lose, and which were the more entirely safe that the money had been spent on so <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.</p>

<h2>III. The description of his sufferings continued</h2>

<p>The baffled plunderer, therefore, frets, and blazing out into <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of a religion, which had put riches to such a use, determines to pillage a still greater treasure by carrying off that sacred deposit , wherewith he was enriched, as he could find no solid hoard of money in his possession. He orders Laurentius to renounce Christ, and prepares to ply the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> stout <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> with frightful tortures: and, when the first elicit nothing, fiercer follow. His limbs, torn and mangled by many cutting blows, are commanded to be broiled upon the fire in an iron framework , which was of itself already hot enough to burn him, and on which his limbs were turned from time to time, to make the torment fiercer, and the death more lingering.</p>

<h2>IV. Laurentius has conquered his persecutor</h2>

<p>You gain nothing, you prevail nothing, O savage cruelty. His mortal frame is released from your devices, and, when Laurentius departs to heaven, you are vanquished. The flame of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> could not be overcome by your flames, and the fire which burnt outside was less keen than that which blazed within. You but served the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> in your rage, O persecutor: you but swelled the reward in adding to the pain. For what did your cunning devise, which did not redound to the conqueror's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, when even the instruments of torture were counted as part of the triumph? Let us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, then, dearly-beloved, with spiritual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and make our boast over the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> end of this illustrious man in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, Who is <q>wonderful in His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> ,</q> in whom He has given us a support and an example, and has so spread abroad his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> throughout the world, that, from the rising of the sun to its going down, the brightness of his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> light does shine, and Rome has become as famous in Laurentius as Jerusalem was ennobled by Stephen. By his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and intercession  we trust at all times to be assisted; that, because all, as the Apostle says, <q>who wish to live holily in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> <span class="stiki" id="note361184"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:12</a></span>,</q> we may be strengthened with the spirit of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and be fortified to overcome all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> by the perseverance of steadfast <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, etc.</p>
