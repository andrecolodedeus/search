<h1>Sermon 85 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[CXXXV. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse4">John 9:4</a> and 31 <em>, <q>We must work the works of him that sent me,</q> etc. Against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. And of that which the man who was born blind and received his sight said, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God hears not sinners.</q></em></p>

<p>1. The Lord Jesus, as we heard when the Holy <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was being read, opened the eyes of a man who was born blind. Brethren, if we consider our hereditary punishment, the whole world is blind. And therefore came Christ the Enlightener, because the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> had been the Blinder. He made all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be born blind, who seduced the first man. Let them run to the Enlightener, let them run, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, receive the clay made of the spittle. The Word is as it were the spittle, the Flesh is the earth. Let them wash the face in the pool of Siloa. Now it was the Evangelist's place to explain to us what Siloa means, and he said, <q>which is by interpretation, Sent.</q>  Who is This That is Sent, but He who in this very Lesson said, <q>I have come to do the works of Him That sent Me.</q>  Lo, Siloa, wash the face, be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that you may be enlightened, and that you who before saw not, may see.</p>

<p>2. Lo, first open your eyes to that which is said; <q>I have come,</q> says He, <q>to do the works of Him That sent Me.</q> Now here at once stands forth the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, and says, <q>Here you see that Christ did not His Own works, but the Father's who sent Him.</q> Would he say this, if he saw, that is, if he had washed his face in Him who was sent, as it were in Siloa? What then do you say? <q>Lo,</q> says he, <q>Himself said it.</q> What said He? <q>I have come to do the works of Him That sent Me.</q> Are they not then His Own? No. What then is that which the Siloa Himself says, the Sent Himself, the Son Himself, the Only Son Himself, whom you complain of as degenerate? What is that He says, <q>All things that the Father has are Mine.</q>  You say that He did the works of Another, in that He said, <q>I must do the works of Him That sent Me.</q> I say that the Father had the things of another: I am speaking according to your  principles. Why would you object to me that Christ said, <q>I have come to do His works</q> as if, <q>not My own but 'His That sent Me'</q>?</p>

<p>3. I ask You, O Lord Christ, resolve the difficulty, put an end to the contention. <q>All things,</q> says He, <q>that the Father has are Mine.</q> Are they then not the Father's, if they are Yours? For He does not say, <q>All things that the Father has He has given unto Me;</q> although, if He had said even this, He would have shown His equality. But the difficulty is that He said, <q>All things that the Father has are Mine.</q> If you understand it aright, All things that the Father has, are the Son's; all things that the Son has, are the Father's. Hear Him in another place; <q>All Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine.</q>  The question is finished, as to the things which the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> have: they have them with one consent, do not you introduce  dissension. What He calls the works of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, are His Own works; for, <q>Yours too are Mine,</q> for He speaks of the works of That Father, to whom He said, <q>All Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine.</q> So then, My works are Yours, and Your works are Mine. <q>For what things soever the Father does;</q>  Himself has said, the Lord has said, the Only-Begotten has said, the Son has said, the Truth has said. What has He said? <q>What things soever the Father does, these also does the Son in like manner.</q> Signal expression! signal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>! signal equality. <q>All things that the Father does, these does the Son also.</q> Were it enough to say, <q>All things that the Father does, these does the Son also</q>? It is not enough; I add, <q>in like manner.</q> Why do I add, <q>in like manner</q>? Because they who do not understand, and who walk with eyes not yet open, are wont to say, <q>The Father does them by way of command, the Son of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, therefore not in like manner.</q> But if in like manner, as the One, so the Other; so what things the One, the same the Other.</p>

<p>4. <q>But,</q> says he, <q>the Father commands, that the Son may execute.</q> Carnal indeed is your conceit, but without prejudice to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I grant it to you. Lo, the Father commands, the Son obeys; is the Son therefore not of the same Nature, because the One commands, and the Other obeys? Give me two men, father and son; they are two men: he that commands is a man; he that obeys is a man; he that commands and he that obeys have one and the same nature. Does not he that commands, beget a son of his own nature? Does he who obeys, by <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> lose his nature? Now take for the present, as you thus take two men, the Father commanding, the Son <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a>, yet God and God. But the first two together are two men, the Latter together is but One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; this is a divine <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. Meanwhile if you would that with you I acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, do you first with me acknowledge the Nature. The Father begot That which Himself is. If the Father begot ought else than what Himself is, He did not beget a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son. The Father says to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <q>From the womb before the day-star, I begot You.</q>  What is, <q>before the day-star</q>? By the day-star times are signified. So then before times, before all that is called <q>before;</q> before all that is not, or before all that is. For the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> does not say, <q>In the beginning God made the Word;</q> as it is said, <q>In the beginning God made the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and the earth;</q>  or, <q>In the beginning was the Word born;</q> or, <q>In the beginning God begot the Word.</q> But what says it? <q>He was, He was, He was.</q> You hear, <q>He was;</q> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God.</q>  So often do you hear, <q>Was:</q> seek not for time, for that He always <q>was.</q> He then who always was, and was always with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, for that God is able to beget without you; He said to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <q>From the womb before the day-star I begot You.</q> What is from the womb? Had God a womb? Shall we <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that God was fashioned with bodily members? God forbid! And why said He, <q>From the womb,</q> but that it might be understood that He begot Him of His Own Substance? So then from the womb came forth That which Himself was who begot. For if He who begot was one thing, and another came forth out of the womb; it were a monster, not a Son.</p>

<p>5. Therefore let the Son do the works of Him That sent Him, and the Father also do the works of the Son. <q>At all events,</q> you say, <q>the Father wills, the Son executes.</q> Lo, I show, that the Son wills, and the Father executes. Do you say, <q>where do you show this?</q> I show it at once. <q>Father, I will.</q>  Now here if I had a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to cavil, lo, the Son commands, and the Father executes. What will You? <q>That where I am, they may be also with Me.</q> We have escaped, there shall we be, where He is; there shall we be, we have escaped. Who can undo the <q>I Will</q> of the Almighty? You hear the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of His power, hear now the power of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. <q>As the Father</q> says He <q>raises up the dead and quickens them; even so the Son quickens whom He will.</q>  <q>Whom He will.</q> Say not, The Son quickens them, whom the Father commands Him to quicken. <q>He quickens whom He will.</q> So then whom the Father will, and whom Himself will: because where there is One Power, there is One Will. Let us then in a heart blind no more hold fast that the Nature of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is One and the Same; because the Father is very Father, the Son is very Son. What He is, That did He beget: because the Begotten was not degenerate.</p>

<p>6. There is a something in the words of that man who was blind, which may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> perplexity, and perhaps make many who understand them not aright despair. For he said among the rest of his words, the same man whose eyes were opened, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God hears not sinners.</q>  What shall we do, if God hears not sinners? Dare we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to God if He hears not sinners? Give me one who may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>: lo, here is One to hear. Give me one who may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, sift thoroughly the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> from the imperfect to the perfect. Mount up from the spring to the summer; for this we have just chanted. <q>You have made summer and spring;</q>  that is, <q>Those who are already spiritual, and those who are still carnal have You made;</q> for so the Son Himself says, <q>Your Eyes have seen My imperfect being.</q>  That which is imperfect in My Body, Your Eyes have seen. And what then? Have they who are imperfect hope? Undoubtedly they have. Hear what follows; <q>And in Your Book shall all be written.</q> But perhaps, Brethren, the spiritual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and are heard, because they are not sinners? What then must the carnal do? What must they do? Shall they perish? Shall they not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to God? God forbid! Give me that <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Come, you <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>, stand forth, show your hope, that the weak may not lose hope. For behold the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> went up with the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and with face cast down upon the ground, standing afar off, beating his breast, he said, <q>Lord, be merciful to me a sinner.  And he went down justified rather than the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>.</q> Said he <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or false, who said, <q>Be merciful to me a sinner</q>? If he said <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, he was a sinner; yet was he heard and justified. What then is that, that you whose eyes the Lord opened said, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God hears not sinners</q>?  Lo, God does hear sinners. But wash your inferior face, let that be done in your heart, which has been done in your face; and you will see that God does hear sinners. The imagination of your heart has deceived you. There is still something for Him to do to you. We see that this man was cast out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>; Jesus heard of it, came to him, and said to him, <q>Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>?</q> And He said, <q>Who is He, Lord, that I should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him?</q>  He saw, and did not see; he saw with the eyes, but as yet with the heart he saw not. The Lord said to him, <q>You both see Him,</q> that is, with the eyes; <q>and He that talks with you is He. He then fell down, and worshipped Him.</q>  Then washed he the face of his heart.</p>

<p>7. Apply yourselves then earnestly to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, you sinners: confess your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that they may be blotted out, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that they may be diminished, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that as you increase, they may decrease: yet do not despair, and sinners though ye be, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. For who has not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>? Begin with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. To the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> it is said, <q>First offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for your own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and so for the people.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> convicted the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that if any one should call himself righteous and without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it might be answered him, <q>I look not at what you say, but at what you offer; your own victim convicts you. Wherefore do you offer for your own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, if you have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? Do you in your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> lie unto God?</q> But perhaps the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the ancient people were sinners; of the new people are not sinners. Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, Brethren, for that God has so willed, I am His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; I am a sinner; with you do I beat the breast, with you I ask for pardon, with you I hope that God will be merciful. But perhaps the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Holy Apostles</a>, those first and highest leaders  of the flock, shepherds, members of The Shepherd, these perhaps had no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Yes, indeed, even they had, they had indeed; they are not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> at this, for they confess it. I should not dare. First hear the Lord Himself saying to the Apostles, <q>In this manner <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> ye.</q>  As those other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were convicted by the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, so these by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. And among the other things which He commanded them to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for, He appointed this also, <q>Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.</q>  What do the Apostles say? Every day they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for their debts to be forgiven them. They come in debtors, they go out absolved, and return debtors to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. This life is not without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that as often as <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is made, so often should <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be forgiven.</p>

<p>8. But what shall I say? Peradventure when they learned the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, they were still weak. Some one, perhaps, will say this. When the Lord Jesus taught them that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, they were yet babes, weak, carnal; they were not yet spiritual, who have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. What then, Brethren? When they became spiritual, did they cease to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>? Then Christ ought to have said, <q>Pray in such wise now;</q> and to have given them, when spiritual, another <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. It is one and the same. He who gave it is One and the Same; use it then in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But we will take away all controversy, when you say the Holy Apostles were spiritual, up to the time of the Lord's Passion they were carnal; this you must say. And indeed, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, as He was hanging, they were in alarm, and the Apostles then despaired when the robber <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Peter dared to follow, when the Lord was led to suffering, he dared to follow, who came to the house, and was wearied in the palace, and stood at the fire, and was cold; he stood at the fire, he was frozen with a chilling <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Being questioned by the maid-servant, he denied Christ once; being questioned a second time, he denied Him; being questioned a third time, he denied Him.  God be thanked, that the questioning ceased; if the questioning had not ceased, long would the denial have been repeated. So then after He rose again, then He confirmed them, then did they become spiritual. Had they at that time then no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? The Apostles spiritual, wrote spiritual epistles, they sent them to the Churches; <q>they had no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> This you say. I do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you, I ask themselves. Tell us, O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles, after the Lord rose again, and confirmed you with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> sent from heaven; did ye cease to have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Tell us, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you. Let us hear, that sinners may not despair, that they may not leave off to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because they are not without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Tell us. One of them says. And who? He whom the Lord loved the most, and who lay on the Lord's Breast,  and drank in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> which he was to pour forth again. Him I ask; <q>Have ye <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or not?</q> He makes answer and says, <q>If we shall say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.</q>  Now it is the same John who said, <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God.</q>  See ye what heights he had passed, that he could reach to the Word! Such an one, and so great, who like an eagle soared above the clouds, who in the serene clearness of his mind saw, <q>In the beginning was the Word;</q> he has said, <q>If we shall say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us. But if we shall confess our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, He is faithful and just to forgive us our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</q>  Therefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> ye.</p>
