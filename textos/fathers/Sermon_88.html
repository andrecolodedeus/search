<h1>Sermon 88</h1>

<p> <em>On the Fast of the Seventh Month, III. </em></p>

<h2>I. The Fasts, which the ancient prophets proclaimed, are still necessary</h2>

<p>Of what avail, dearly-beloved, are religious <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> in winning the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in renewing the fortunes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the statements of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Prophets, who proclaim that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose vengeance the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had again and again incurred through their iniquities, cannot be appeased save by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. Thus it is that the Prophet Joel warns them, saying, <q>thus says the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, turn to Me with all your heart, with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and weeping and mourning, and rend your hearts and not your garments, and turn to the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He is merciful and patient, and of great kindness, and very merciful ,</q> and again, <q>sanctify a fast, proclaim a healing, assemble the people, sanctify the church. </q> And this exhortation must in our days also be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, because these healing remedies must of necessity be proclaimed by us too, in order that in the observance of the ancient sanctification <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> devotion may gain what Jewish transgression lost.</p>

<h2>II. Public services are of a higher character than private</h2>

<p>But the respect that is paid to the Divine decrees always brings a special blessing, whatever may be the extent of our <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> services, so that publicly proclaimed celebrations are of a higher character than those which rest on private institution.  For the exercise of self-restraint, which each individual imposes on himself at his own discretion, concerns the benefit of a certain portion only of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but the fast which the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> undergoes leaves out no one from the general purification, and God's people then become strongest, when the hearts of all the faithful meet together in one common act of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, when in the camp of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> army there is on all sides the same making ready for the fight and for defence. Though the cruel enemy rage in restless fury, and spread all round his hidden snares, yet he will be able to catch no one and wound no one, if he find no one off his guard, no one given up to sloth, no one inactive in works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>.</p>

<h2>III. The September fast calls us in this public way to self-amendment</h2>

<p>To this unconquerable strength of unity, therefore, dearly-beloved, we are even now invited by the solemn Fast of the Seventh Month, that we may lift our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to the Lord free from worldly cares and earthly concerns. And because, always needful as this endeavour is, we cannot all adhere to it perpetually, and often through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty we fall back from higher things to the things of earth, let us at least on these days, which are most healthfully ordained for our correction, withdraw ourselves from worldly occupations, and steal a little time for promoting our <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> welfare. <q>For in many things,</q> as it is written, <q>we all stumble <span class="stiki" id="note361189"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse2">James&nbsp;3:2</a></span> .</q> And though by the daily gift of God  we be cleansed from various pollutions, yet there cling to unwary <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> for the most part darker stains, which need a greater care to wash them out, a stronger effort to destroy them. And the fullest abolition of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is obtained when the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> offers up one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and one confession. For if the Lord has promised fulfilment of all they shall ask, to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and devout agreement of two or three, what shall be denied to many thousands of the people who unite in one act of worship, and with one breath make their common supplications <span class="stiki" id="note361191"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;18:19-20</a></span>?</p>

<h2>IV. Community of goods and of actions is most precious in God's sight</h2>

<p>It is a great and very precious thing, beloved, in the Lord's sight, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> whole people engage together in the same duties, and all ranks and degrees of either sex co-operate with the same intent: when one purpose animates all alike of declining from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and doing good; when God is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in the works of His slaves, and the Author of all godliness  is <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in unstinted giving of thanks. The hungry are nourished, the naked are clothed, the sick are visited, and men seek not their own but <q>that which is another's ,</q> so long as in relieving the misery of others each one makes the most of his own means; and it is easy to find <q>a cheerful giver ,</q> where a man's performances are only limited by the extent of his power. By this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>which works all in all ,</q> the benefit and the deserts of the faithful are both enjoyed in common. For they, whose income is not like, can yet think alike, and when one rejoices over another's bounty his feelings put him on the same level with him whose powers of spending are on a different level. In such a community there is no disorder nor diversity, for all the members of the whole body agree in one strong purpose of godliness, and he who glories in the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of others is not put to shame at his own poverty. For the excellence of each portion is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the whole body, and when we are all led by God's Spirit, not only are the things we do ourselves our own but those of others also over the doing of which we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>.</p>

<h2>V. Let us then make the best use possible of the opportunity</h2>

<p>Let us then, dearly-beloved, lay hold upon this most sacred unity in all its blessed integrity and engage in the solemn fast with the concordant purpose of a good will. Nothing hard, nothing harsh is asked of anyone, nor is anything imposed beyond our strength, whether in the discipline of abstinence or in the amount of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Each <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what he can and what he cannot do: let every one pay his quota, assessing himself at a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and reasonable rate, that the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of mercy be not offered sadly nor reckoned among losses. Let so much be expended on <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> work, as will justify the heart, wash the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and in a word profit both giver and receiver. Happy indeed is that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to be admired which in its <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of doing good fears not the failing of the means, and has no distrust that He will give him money still to spend, from Whom he had what he spent in the past. But because few possess this greatness of heart, and yet it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> thing for each one not to forsake the care of his own, we, without prejudice to the more perfect sort, lay down for you this general rule and exhort you to perform God's bidding according to the measure of your ability. For cheerfulness becomes the benevolent man, who should so manage his liberality that while the poor <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over the help supplied, home needs may not suffer. <q>And He that ministers seed to the sower, shall both provide bread to be eaten and multiply your seed and increase the fruits of your righteousness <span class="stiki" id="note361196"><a href="../bible/2co009.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:10</a></span> .</q> On Wednesday and Friday therefore let us fast; and on Saturday keep vigil all together  in the presence of the most blessed Apostle Peter, by whose merits and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> we are sure God's mercy will be vouchsafed to us in all things through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, Who lives and reigns for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
