<h1>Sermon 9</h1>

<p> <em>Upon the Collections , IV.</em></p>

<h2>I. The devil's wickednessin leading men astray is now counteracted by the work of redemption in restoring them to the truth</h2>

<p>God's mercy and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, dearly-beloved, has in loving-kindness disclosed to us through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ's</a> teaching, the manner of His retributions, as they have been ordained from the foundation of the world, that accepting the significance of facts we might take what we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> will happen, to have, as it were, already come to pass. For our Redeemer and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what great <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> deceit had dispersed throughout the world and by how many <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a> he had subjected the chief part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> to himself. But that the creature formed in God's image might not any longer through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the Truth be driven on to the precipice of perpetual death, He inserted in the Gospel-pages the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His judgment that it might recover every man from the snares of the crafty foe; for now all would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what rewards the good might hope for and what punishments the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> must <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For the instigator and author of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in order first to fall through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and then to injure us through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, because <q>he stood not in the Truth <span class="stiki" id="note360670"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> </q> put all his strength in lying and produced every kind of deceit from this poisoned source of his cunning, that he might cut off man's devout hopes from that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which he had lost by his own uplifting, and drag them into partnership with his condemnation, to whose reconciliation he himself could not attain. Whoever therefore among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> has wronged God by his wickednesses, has been led astray by his guile, and depraved by his villainy. For he easily drives into all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doings those whom he has deceived in the matter of religion. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that God is denied not only by words but also by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, many whom he could not rob of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he has <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> of their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and by choking the ground of their heart with the weeds of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, has spoiled them of the fruit of good works, when he could not spoil them of the confession of their lips.</p>

<h2>II. God's just judgment against sin is denounced that we may avoid it by deeds of mercy and love</h2>

<p>On account therefore, dearly-beloved, of these crafty designs of our ancient foe, the unspeakable goodness of Christ has wished us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, what was to be decreed about all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> in the day of retribution, that, while in this life healing remedies are legitimately offered, while restoration is not denied to the contrite, and those who have been long barren can at length be fruitful, the verdict on which <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has determined may be fore-stalled and the picture of God's coming to judge the world never depart from the mind's eye. For the Lord will come in His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Majesty, as He Himself has foretold, and there will be with Him an innumerable host of angel-legions radiant in their splendour. Before the throne of His power will all the nations of the world be gathered; and all the men that in all ages and on all the face of the earth have been born, shall stand in the Judge's sight. Then shall be separated the just from the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, the guiltless from the guilty; and when the sons of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, their works of mercy reviewed, have received the Kingdom prepared for them, the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> shall be upbraided for their utter barrenness, and those on the left having naught in common with those on the right, shall by the condemnation of the Almighty Judge be cast into the fire prepared for the torture of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, with him to share the punishment, whose will they choose to do. Who then would not tremble at this doom of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> torment? Who would not dread <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which are never to be ended? But since this severity is only denounced in order that we may seek for mercy, we too in this present life must show such open-handed mercy that after perilous neglect returning to works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> it may be possible for us to be set free from this doom. For this is the purpose of the Judge's might and of the Saviour's graciousness, that the unrighteous may forsake his ways and the sinner give up his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> habits. Let those who wish Christ to spare them, have mercy on the poor; let them give freely to feed the wretched, who desire to attain to the society of the blessed. Let no man consider his fellow vile, nor despise in any one that nature which the Creator of the world made His own. For who that labours can deny that Christ claims that labour as done unto Himself? Your fellow-slave is helped thereby, but it is the Lord who will repay. The feeding of the needy is the purchase money of the heavenly kingdom and the free dispenser of things temporal is made the heir of things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But how has such small expenditure deserved to be valued so highly except because our works are weighed in the balance of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and when a man loves what God loves, he is deservedly raised into His kingdom, whose attribute of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has in part become his?</p>

<h2>III. We minister to Christ Himself in the person of his poor</h2>

<p>To this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> duty of good works, therefore dearly beloved, the day of Apostolic institution  invites us, on which the first collection of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> offerings has been prudently and profitably ordained by the Fathers; in order that, because at this season formerly the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> used superstitiously to serve <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, we might celebrate the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> offering of our <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> in protest against the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> victims of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. And because this has been most profitable to the growth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it has been resolved to make it perpetual. We exhort you, therefore, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren throughout the churches of your several regions  on Wednesday next  to contribute of your goods, according to your means and willingness, to purposes of charity, that you may be able to win that blessedness in which he shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> without end, who <q>considers the needy and poor. </q> And if we are to <q>consider</q> him, dearly beloved, we must use loving care and watchfulness, in order that we may find him whom modesty conceals and shamefastness keeps back. For there are those who blush openly to ask for what they want and prefer to suffer privation without speaking rather than to be put to shame by a public appeal. These are they whom we ought to <q>consider</q> and relieve from their hidden straits in order that they may the more <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> from the very fact that their modesty as well as poverty has been consulted. And rightly in the needy and poor do we recognize the person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord Himself, <q>Who though He was rich,</q> as says the blessed Apostle, <q>became poor, that He might enrich us by His poverty <span class="stiki" id="note360675"><a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:9</a></span> .</q> And that His presence might never seem to be wanting to us, He so effected the mystic union of His humility and His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that while we adore Him as King and Lord in the Majesty of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, we might also feed Him in His poor, for which we shall be set free in an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> day from perpetual damnation, and for our considerate care of the poor shall be joined with the whole company of heaven.</p>

<h2>IV. To complete their acceptance by God, they must not neglect to lay all information against the Manichees who are in the city</h2>

<p>But in order that your devotion, dearly beloved, may in all things be pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we exhort you also to show due <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in informing your <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of Manichees where ever they be hidden.  For it is naught but <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to disclose the hiding-places of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and in them to overthrow the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> whom they serve. For against them, dearly beloved, it becomes indeed the whole world and the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> everywhere to put on the armour of Faith: but your devotion ought to be foremost in this work, who in your progenitors learned the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the Cross of Christ from the very mouth of the most blessed Apostles Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Men must not be allowed to lie hidden who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the law given through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is shown to be the Creator of the Universe, ought to be received: who speak against the Prophets and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, dare in their damnable profanity to reject the Psalms of David which are sung through the universal Church with all reverence, deny the birth of the Lord Christ, according to the flesh, say that His Passion and Resurrection was fictitious, not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and deprive the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of regeneration of all its power as a means of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Nothing with them is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, nothing entire, nothing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. They are to be shunned, lest they harm any one: they are to be given up, lest they should settle in any part of our city. Yours, dearly beloved, will be the gain before the Lord's judgment-seat of what we bid, of what we ask. For it is but right that the triumph of this deed also should be joined to the oblation of our <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> in all things aiding us, Who lives and reigns for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
