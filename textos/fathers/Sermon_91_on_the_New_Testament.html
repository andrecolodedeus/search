<h1>Sermon 91 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[CXLI. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John 14:6</a> <em>, <q>I am the way, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life.</q></em></p>

<p>1. Amongst other things, when the Holy <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was being read, you heard what the Lord Jesus said, <q>I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life.</q>  Truth and life does every man desire; but not every man does find the way. That God is a certain Life Eternal, Unchangeable, Intelligible, Intelligent, Wise, Making wise, some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> even of this world have seen. The fixed, settled, unwavering <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, wherein are all the principles  of all things created, they saw indeed, but afar off; they saw, but amid the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in which they were placed; and therefore what way to attain to that so great, and ineffable, and beatific a possession they formed not. For that even they saw (as far as can be seen by man) the Creator by means of the creature, the Worker by His work, the Framer of the world by the world, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> ought surely to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For he said when he was speaking of such; <q>The <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness.</q>  These are, as you recognise, the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>; <q>The <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men; who detain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in unrighteousness.</q> Did he say that they do not detain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? No: but, <q>They detained the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in unrighteousness.</q> What they detain, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but wherein they detain it, is bad. <q>They detain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in unrighteousness.</q></p>

<p>2. Now it occurred to him that it might be said to him, <q>Whence do these ungodly men detain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Hath God spoken to any one of them? Have they received the Law as the people of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? Whence then do they detain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, though it be even in this unrighteousness?</q> Hear what follows, and he shows. <q>Because that which can be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> he says, <q>is manifest in them; for God has manifested it unto them.</q>  Manifested it unto them to whom He has not given the Law? Hear how He has manifested it. <q>For the invisible things of Him are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.</q>  Ask the world, the beauty of the heaven, the brilliancy and ordering of the stars, the sun, that suffices for the day, the moon, the solace of the night; ask the earth fruitful in herbs, and trees, full of animals, adorned with men; ask the sea, with how great and what kind of fishes filled; ask the air, with how great birds stocked;  ask all things, and see if they do not as if it were by a language  of their own make answer to you, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made us.</q> These things have illustrious <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> sought out, and by the art have come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Artificer. What then? Why is the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God revealed against this ungodliness? <q>Because they detain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in unrighteousness?</q> Let him come, let him show how. For how they came to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, he has said already. <q>The invisible things of Him,</q> that is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Power also and Godhead; so that they are without excuse. Because that when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</q>  They are the Apostle's words, not mine: <q>And their foolish heart was darkened; for professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.</q>  What by curious search they found, by <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> they lost. <q>Professing themselves to be wise,</q> attributing, that is, the gift of God to themselves, <q>they became fools.</q> They are the Apostle's words, I say; <q>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.</q></p>

<p>3. Show, prove their foolishness. Show, O Apostle, and as you have shown us whereby they were able to attain to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for that <q>the invisible things of Him are clearly seen, being understood by those things that are made;</q> so now show how, <q>professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.</q> Hear; Because <q>they changed,</q> he says, <q>the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of a corruptible man, and of birds, and of four-footed beasts, and of creeping things.</q>  For of figures of these animals, the Pagans made themselves gods. You have found out <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and you worship an idol. You have found out the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and this very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> do you detain in unrighteousness. And what by the works of God you have come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, by the works of man you lose. You have considered the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>,  hast collected the order of the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all the elements; you will not take heed to this, that the world is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, an idol is the work of a carpenter. If the carpenter as he has given the figure, could also give a heart, the carpenter would be worshipped by his own idol. For, O man, as God is your Framer, so the idol's framer is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Who is your God? He That made you. Who is the carpenter's god? He That made him. Who is the idol's god? He that made it. If then the idol had a heart, would he not worship the carpenter who made it? See in what unrighteousness they detained the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and found not the way that leads to that possession which they saw.</p>

<p>4. But Christ, for that He is with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the Truth, and Life, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, of whom it is said, <q>The Life was the Light of men;</q>  for that I say He is with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the Truth, and Life, and we had no way whereby to go to the Truth, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who is ever in the Father the Truth and Life, by assuming man's nature became the Way. Walk by Him as Man, and you come to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. By Him you go, to Him you go. Look not out for any way whereby to come to Him, besides Himself. For if He had not vouchsafed to be the Way, we should have always gone astray. He then became the Way Whereby you should come; I do not say to you, seek the Way. The Way Itself has come to you, arise and walk. Walk, with the life,  not with the feet. For many walk well with the feet, and with their lives walk ill. For sometimes even those who walk well, run outside the way. Thus you will find men living well, and not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. They run well; but they run not in the way. The more they run, the more they go astray; because they are out of the Way. But if such men as these come to the Way, and hold on the Way, O how great is their security, because they both walk well, and do not go astray! But if they do not hold on the Way, however well they walk, alas! How are they to be bewailed! For better is it to halt in the way, than to walk on stoutly outside the way. Let this suffice for you, Beloved. Turn we to the Lord, etc.</p>
