<h1>Sermon 93 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[CXLIII. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse7">John 16:7</a> <em>, <q>I tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; it is expedient for you that I go away,</q> etc.</em></p>

<p>1. The medicine for all the wounds of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the one propitiation for the offenses of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ; nor can any one be cleansed at all, whether from original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he derived from Adam,  in whom all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and become by nature children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; or from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which they have themselves added, by not resisting the concupiscence of the flesh, but by following and serving it in unclean and injurious <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>: unless by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they are united and compacted into His Body, who was conceived without any enticement of the flesh and deadly pleasure, and whom His Mother nourished in her womb without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and <q>Who did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither was deceit found in His Mouth.</q>  They verily who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, become the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because they are born of God by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of adoption, which is by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord. Wherefore, dearly Beloved, it is with good reason that the same Lord and our Saviour mentions this one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> only, of which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> convinces the world, that it <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not on Him. <q>I tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> He says, <q>It is expedient for you that I go away. For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you. And when He shall come, He will convince the world of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and of righteousness, and of judgment. Of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not on Me. Of righteousness, because I go to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and you shall see Me no more. Of judgment, because the prince of this world is already judged.</q> </p>

<p>2. Of this one only <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> then He would have the world to be convinced, that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not on Him; to wit, because by believing on Him all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are loosed, He would have this one imputed by which the rest are bound. And because by believing they are born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and become children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <q>For,</q> says he, <q>to them gave He power to become the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him.</q>  Whoso then <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, in so far as he adheres to Him, and becomes himself also by adoption a son and heir of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a joint-heir with Christ, in so far he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not. Whence John says, <q>Whosoever is born of God <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not.</q>  And therefore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of which the world is convinced is this, that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not on Him. This is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of which He also says, <q>If I had not come, they had not had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q>  For what! Had they not innumerable other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? But by His coming this one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was added to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not, by which the rest should be retained. Whereas in them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, because this one was wanting, it was brought to pass that all should be remitted to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Nor is it with any other view that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says, All have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and have need of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;  that <q>whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Him, should not be confounded;</q>  as the Psalm also says <q>Come to Him, and be enlightened, and your faces shall not be confounded.</q>  Whoso then <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> in himself shall be confounded; for he shall not be found without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Accordingly he only shall not be confounded who <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> in the Lord. <q>For all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and have need of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And so when he was speaking of the infidelity of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, he did not say, <q>For if some of them have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, shall their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> make the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of God of none effect?</q> For how should he say, <q>If some of them have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>;</q> when he said himself, <q>For all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a></q>? But he said, <q>If some of them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not, shall their unbelief make the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of God of none effect?</q>  That he might point out more expressly this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by which alone the door is closed against the rest that they by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God should not be remitted. Of which one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, that is by the gift of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is granted to the faithful, the world is convinced, in the Lord's words, <q>Of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not on Me.</q></p>

<p>3. Now there would be no great merit and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> blessedness in believing, if the Lord had always appeared in His Risen Body to the eyes of men. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> then has brought this great gift to them that should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that Him whom they should not see with the eyes of flesh, they might with a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> sobered from carnal desires, and inebriated with spiritual longings, sigh after. Whence it was that when that <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> who had said that he would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, unless he touched with the hands His Scars, after he had handled the Lord's Body, cried out as though awaking from sleep, <q>My Lord and my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> the Lord said to him, <q>Because you have seen Me, you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</q>  This blessedness has the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the Comforter, brought to us, that the form of a servant which He took from the Virgin's womb, being removed from the eyes of flesh, the purified eye of the mind might be directed to This Form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in which He continued equal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, even when He vouchsafed to appear in the Flesh; so as that with the Same Spirit filled the Apostle might say, <q>Though we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ after the flesh; yet now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him so no longer.</q>  Because even the Flesh of Christ he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not after the flesh, but after the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, who, not by touching in curiosity, but in believing assured, acknowledges the power of His Resurrection; not saying in his heart, <q>Who has ascended into heaven? That is, to bring Christ down; or, Who has descended into the deep? That is, to bring back Christ from the dead.</q> <q>But,</q> says he, <q>the word is near you, in your mouth, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Lord; and if you shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved. For with the heart man <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q>  These, Brethren, are the words of the Apostle, pouring them forth with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> inebriation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Himself.</p>

<p>4. Forasmuch then as we could in no way have had this blessedness by which we see not and yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, unless we received it of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; it is with good reason said, <q>It is expedient for you that I go away. For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you.</q>  By His Divinity indeed He is with us always; but unless He had in Body gone away from us, we had always seen His Body after the flesh. and never <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> after a spiritual sort; by the which belief justified and blessed we might attain  with cleansed hearts to contemplate the Very Word, God with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>by whom all things were made,</q> and <q>who was made Flesh, that He might dwell among us.</q> And if not with the contact of the hand, but <q>with the heart man <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> unto righteousness;</q> with good reason is the world, which will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> save what it sees, convinced of our righteousness. Now that we might have that righteousness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of which the unbelieving world should be convinced, therefore said the Lord, <q>Of righteousness, because I go to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and you shall see Me no more.</q> As if He had said, This shall be your righteousness, that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Me, the Mediator, of whom you shall be most fully assured that He is risen again and gone to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, though
 you see Him not after the Flesh; that by Him reconciled, you may be able to see God after the Spirit. Whence He says to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who represents the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when she fell at His Feet after His Resurrection, <q>Touch Me not, for I am not yet ascended to the Father.</q>  Which expression is understood <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a>, thus. <q>Believe not in Me after a carnal manner by means of bodily contact; but you shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> after a spiritual manner; that is, with a spiritual <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall touch Me, when I shall have ascended to the Father.</q> For, <q>blessed are they who do not see, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> And this is the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of which the world, which has it not, is convinced of us who are not without it; for <q>the just lives by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q>  Whether it be then that as rising again in Him, and in Him coming to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, we are invisibly and in justification perfected; or that as not seeing and yet believing we live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for that <q>the just lives by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> with these meanings said He, <q>Of righteousness, because I go to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and you shall see Me no more.</q></p>

<p>5. Nor let the world excuse itself by this, that it is hindered by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> from believing on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> the prince of the world is cast out,  that he work no more in the hearts of men whom Christ has begun to possess by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; as he works in the children of unbelief;  whom he is constantly stirring up to tempt and disturb the righteous. For because he is cast out, who once had dominion interiorly he wages <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> exteriorly. Although then by means of his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, <q>the Lord does direct the meek in judgment;</q>  nevertheless in this very fact of his being cast out, is he <q>judged already.</q> And of this, <q>judgment</q> is the world convinced; for in vain does he who will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ complain of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> whom, judged, that is, cast out, and for the exercising of us allowed to attack us from without, not only men, but even <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and boys, and girls, Martyrs have overcome. Now in whom have they overcome, but in Him on whom they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and whom seeing not, they loved, and by whose dominion in their hearts they have got rid of a most oppressive  lord. And all this by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, by the gift, that is, of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Rightly then does the Same Spirit convince the world, both of <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> because it <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not on Christ; <q>and of righteousness,</q> because they who have had the will have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, though Him on whom they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> they saw not; and by His Resurrection have hoped that themselves also should be in the resurrection perfected; <q>and of judgment,</q> because if they had had the will to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, they could be hindered by none, <q>for that the prince of this world has been judged already.</q></p>
