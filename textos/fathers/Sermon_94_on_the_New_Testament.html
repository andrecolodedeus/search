<h1>Sermon 94 on the New Testament</h1>

<p><strong>[CXLIV. Ben.]</strong></p>

<p> <em>On the same words of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></em>, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse8">John 16:8</a> <em>, <q>He will convict the world in respect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and of righteousness, and of judgement.</q></em></p>

<p>1. When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a> was speaking at length of the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, He said among the rest, <q>He shall convince the world of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and of righteousness, and of judgment.</q>  Nor when He had said this, did He pass on to another subject; but vouchsafed to convey a somewhat more explicit notice of this same <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <q>Of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> said He, <q>because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not on Me. Of righteousness, because I go to the Father. Of judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged already.</q>  There arises therefore within us a desire of understanding, why as if it were men's only <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ, He said it of this alone, that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> should convince the world; but if it is plain that besides this unbelief there are manifold other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, why of this alone should the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> convince the world? Is it because all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are by unbelief retained, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> remitted; that therefore God imputes this one above all the rest, by which it comes to pass that the rest are not loosed, so long as <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> man believes not in an Humbled God? For so it is written; <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> resists the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, but gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unto the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>.</q>  Now this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the greatest gift is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Himself; and therefore is it called <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For forasmuch <q>as all had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and needed the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because by one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in whom all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>;</q>  therefore is it <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> because given gratuitously. And therefore is it given gratuitously, because it is not rendered as a reward after a strict scrutiny of deserts, but given as a gift after the pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>2. Therefore of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are unbelievers, that is, the lovers of the world, convinced; for they are signified by the name of the world. For when it is said, <q>He will convince the world of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q> it is of none other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> than that they have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For if this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> exist not, no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> will remain, because when the just man lives by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, all are loosed. Now the difference is great as to whether one <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is Christ, or whether he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is Christ even the devils <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and yet the devils <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who both hopes in Christ and loves Christ. For if he have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is, but he does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Whoso then <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by believing on Christ, Christ comes unto him, and in a manner unites Himself to him, and he is made a member in His Body. Which cannot be, but by the accession of hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p>3. What mean again His words, <q>Of righteousness, because I go to the Father</q>? And first must we enquire, if the world is convinced of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, why it is also of righteousness? For who can rightly be convinced of righteousness? Is it indeed that the world is convinced of its own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> righteousness? I do not see what else can be understood; since He says, <q>Of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not on Me. Of righteousness, because I go to the Father.</q> They <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not, He goes to the Father. Their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> therefore, and His righteousness. But why would He name righteousness in this only, that He goes to the Father? Is it not righteousness also that He came hither from the Father? Or is that rather mercy, that He came from the Father to us, and righteousness, that He goes to the Father?</p>

<p>4. So, Brethren, I think it expedient, that in so profound a depth of Scripture, in words, wherein perhaps there lies some hidden <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which may in due season be laid open, we should as it were together enquire faithfully, that we may attain  to find healthfully. Why then does He call this righteousness, in that He goes to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and not also in that He came from the Father? Is it that in that it is mercy that He came, therefore it is righteousness that He goes? That so in our own case too we may learn that righteousness cannot be fulfilled in us, if we are slow to give a place first  to mercy, <q>not seeking our own things, but the things of others also.</q> Which advice when the Apostle had given, he immediately joined to it the example of our Lord Himself; <q>Doing nothing,</q> says he, <q>through strife or vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; but in lowliness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, each esteeming the other better than themselves. Not looking every man on his own things, but also on the things of others.</q> Then he added immediately, <q>Let this mind be in each of you which was also in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, who, being in the Form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and found in fashion as a man; He humbled Himself, having become <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> even unto death, yea the death of the cross.</q>  This is the mercy whereby He came from the Father. What then is the righteousness whereby He goes to the Father? He goes on and says; <q>Wherefore God also has exalted Him, and given Him a Name which is above every name; that at the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Name of Jesus</a> every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> is in the Glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father.</q> This is the righteousness whereby He goes to the Father.</p>

<p>5. But if He Alone goes to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, what does it profit us? Why is the world convinced by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> of this righteousness? And yet if He did not Alone go to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He would not say in another place, <q>No man has ascended up to heaven, but He That descended from heaven, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> who is in heaven.</q>  But the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> also says, <q>For our conversation is in heaven.</q>  And why is this? Because he also says, <q>If you be risen with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Mind the things which are above, not those which are upon the earth. For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  How then is He Alone? Is He therefore Alone because Christ with all His members is One, as the Head with His Body? Now what is His Body, but the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? As the same teacher says, <q>Now you are the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and members in particular.</q>  Forasmuch then as we have fallen, and He descended for our sakes, what is, <q>No man has ascended, but He That descended;</q> but that no man has ascended, except as made one with Him, and as a member fastened into His Body who descended? And thus He says to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>Without Me ye can do nothing.</q>  For in one way is He One with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and in another one with us. He is One with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in that the Substance of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is One; He is One with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in that, <q>Being in the Form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> But He was made One with us, in that <q>He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant;</q> He was made one with us, according to the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <q>in whom all nations shall be blessed.</q> Which place when the Apostle had brought forward, he said, <q>He says not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your Seed, which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q>  And for that we too belong to that which is Christ, by our incorporation together, and coherence to That Head, It is One Christ. And also for that he says to us too, <q>Therefore are you <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> seed, heirs according to the promise.</q>  For if the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> be One, and That One Seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> can only be understood of Christ; but this seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> we also are; therefore This Whole, that is, the Head and the Body, is One Christ.</p>

<p>6. And therefore we ought not to deem ourselves separated from that righteousness, which the Lord Himself makes mention of, saying, <q>Of righteousness, because I go to the Father.</q> For we too have risen with Christ, and we are with Christ our Head, now for a while  by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope; but our hope will be completed in the last resurrection of the dead. But when our hope shall be completed, then shall our justification be completed also. And the Lord who was to complete it showed us in His Own Flesh (that is, in our Head), Wherein He rose again and ascended to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, what we ought to hope for. For that thus it is written, <q>He was delivered for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and rose again for our justification.</q>  The world then is convinced <q>of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></q> in those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not on Christ; <q>and of righteousness,</q> in those who rise again in the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Whence it is said, <q>That we may be the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in him.</q>  For if not in Him, in no way righteousness. But if in Him, He goes with us Whole to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and this perfect righteousness will be fulfilled in us. And therefore <q>of judgment</q> too is the world convinced, <q>because the prince of this world has been judged already;</q> that is, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, the prince of the unrighteous, who in heart inhabit only in this world which they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and therefore are called <q>the world;</q> as our conversation is in heaven, if we have risen again with Christ. Therefore as Christ together with us, that is His Body, is One; so the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> with all the ungodly whose head he is, with as it were his own body, is one. Wherefore as we are not separated from the righteousness, of which the Lord said, <q>Because I go to the Father;</q> so the ungodly are not separated from that judgment, of which He said, <q>Because the prince of this world has been judged already.</q></p>
