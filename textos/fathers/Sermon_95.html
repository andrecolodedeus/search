<h1>Sermon 95</h1>

<p> <em>A Homily on the Beatitudes, St.</em> <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse1">Matthew 5:1-9</a></p>

<h2>I. Introduction of the subject</h2>

<p>When <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, beloved, was preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, and was healing various sicknesses through the whole of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, the fame of His mighty works had spread into all <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>: large crowds too from all parts of Jud&aelig;a were flocking to the heavenly Physician. <span class="stiki" id="note361219"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;4:23-24</a></span> For as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is slow in believing what it does not see, and in hoping for what it does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, those who were to be instructed in the divine lore , needed to be aroused by bodily benefits and visible <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>: so that they might have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the wholesomeness of His teaching when they actually experienced His benignant power. And therefore that the Lord might use outward healings as an introduction to inward remedies, and after healing bodies might work cures in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, He separated Himself from the surrounding crowd, ascended into the retirement of a neighbouring mountain, and called His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to Him there, that from the height of that mystic seat He might instruct them in the loftier doctrines, signifying from the very nature of the place and act that He it was who had once honoured <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by speaking to him: then indeed with a more terrifying <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but now with a holier mercifulness, that what had been promised might be fulfilled when the <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Prophet Jeremiah</a> says: <q>behold the days come when I will complete a new covenant  for the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and for the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Judah</a>. After those days, says the Lord, I will put My <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in their minds , and in their heart will I write them. </q> He therefore who had spoken to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, spoke also to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and the swift hand of the Word wrote and deposited the secrets of the new covenant  in the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples'</a> hearts: there were no thick clouds surrounding Him as of old, nor were the people frightened off from approaching the mountain by frightful sounds and lightning , but quietly and freely His discourse reached the ears of those who stood by: that the harshness of the law might give way before the gentleness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and <q>the spirit of adoption</q> might dispel the terrors of bondage. </p>

<h2>II. The blessedness of humility discussed</h2>

<p>The nature then of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> teaching is attested by His own <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> statements: that they who wish to arrive at <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessedness may understand the steps of ascent to that high <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. <q>Blessed,</q> He says, <q>are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> <span class="stiki" id="note361227"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;5:3</a></span> .</q> It would perhaps be doubtful what poor He was speaking of, if in saying <q>blessed are the poor</q> He had added nothing which would explain the sort of poor: and then that poverty by itself would appear sufficient to win the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> which many suffer from hard and heavy necessity. But when He says <q>blessed are the poor <em>in spirit</em>,</q> He shows that the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> must be assigned to those who are recommended by the humility of their spirits rather than by the smallness of their means. Yet it cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that this possession of humility is more easily acquired by the poor than the rich: for submissiveness is the companion of those that want, while loftiness of mind dwells with riches.  Notwithstanding, even in many of the rich is found that spirit which uses its abundance not for the increasing of its <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> but on works of kindness, and counts that for the greatest gain which it expends in the relief of others' hardships. It is given to every kind and rank of men to share in this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because men may be equal in will, though unequal in fortune: and it does not matter how different they are in earthly means, who are found equal in spiritual possessions. Blessed, therefore, is poverty which is not possessed with a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of temporal things, and does not seek to be increased with the riches of the world, but is eager to amass heavenly possessions.</p>

<h2>III. Scriptural examples of humility</h2>

<p>Of this high-souled humility the Apostles first , after the Lord, have given us example, who, leaving all that they had without difference at the voice of the heavenly Master, were turned by a ready change from the catching of fish to be fishers of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and made many like themselves through the imitation of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when with those first-begotten sons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <q>the heart of all was one, and the spirit one, of those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <span class="stiki" id="note361230"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse32">Acts&nbsp;4:32</a></span>:</q> for they, putting away the whole of their things and possessions, enriched themselves with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> goods, through the most devoted poverty, and in accordance with the Apostles' preaching rejoiced to have nothing of the world and possess all things with Christ. Hence the blessed Apostle Peter, when he was going up into the temple, and was asked for <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> by the lame man, said, <q>Silver and gold is not mine, but what I have that I give you: in the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ of Nazareth</a>, arise and walk <span class="stiki" id="note361231"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse6">Acts&nbsp;3:6</a></span> .</q> What more sublime than this humility? What richer than this poverty? He has not stores of money , but he has gifts of nature. He whom his mother had brought forth lame from the womb, is made whole by Peter with a word; and he who gave not C&aelig;sar's image in a coin, restored Christ's image on the man. And by the riches of this treasure not he only was aided whose power of walking was restored, but 5,000 men also, who then <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> at the Apostle's exhortation on account of the wonder of this cure. And that poor man who had not what to give to the asker, bestowed so great a bounty of Divine Grace, that, as he had set one man straight on his feet, so he healed these many thousands of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in their hearts, and made them <q>leap as an hart</q> in Christ whom he had found limping in Jewish unbelief.</p>

<h2>IV. The blessedness of mourning discussed</h2>

<p>After the assertion of this most <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> humility, the Lord has added, saying, <q>Blessed are they which mourn, for they shall be comforted <span class="stiki" id="note361233"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;5:4</a></span> .</q> This mourning, beloved, to which <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> comforting is promised, is not the same as the affliction of this world: nor do those laments which are poured out in the sorrowings of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> make any one blessed. The reason for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> groanings, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of blessed tears, is very different. Religious grief mourns <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> either that of others' or one's own: nor does it mourn for that which is wrought by God's <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but it laments over that which is committed by man's iniquity, where he that does wrong is more to be deplored than he who suffers it, because the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> man's wrongdoing plunges him into punishment, but the just man's endurance leads him on to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<h2>V. The blessedness of the meek</h2>

<p>Next the Lord says: <q>blessed are the meek, for they shall possess the earth by inheritance. </q> To the meek and gentle, to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and modest, and to those who are prepared to endure all injuries, the earth is promised for their possession. And this is not to be reckoned a small or cheap inheritance, as if it were distinct from our heavenly dwelling, since it is no other than these who are understood to enter the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. The earth, then, which is promised to the meek, and is to be given to the gentle in possession, is the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, which in reward for their humility will be changed in a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> resurrection, and clothed with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, in nothing now to act contrary to the spirit, and to be in complete unity and agreement with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.  For then the outer man will be the peaceful and unblemished possession of the inner man: then the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, engrossed in beholding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, will be hampered by no obstacles of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness nor will it any more have to be said <q>The body which is corrupted, weighs upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and its earthly house presses down the sense which thinks many things <span class="stiki" id="note361236"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span>:</q> for the earth will not struggle against its tenant, and will not venture on any insubordination against the rule of its governor. For the meek shall possess it in perpetual peace, and nothing shall be taken from their rights, <q>when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> <span class="stiki" id="note361237"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse53">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:53</a></span>:</q> that their danger may turn into reward, and what was a burden become an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. </p>

<h2>VI. The blessedness of desiring righteousness</h2>

<p>After this the Lord goes on to say: <q>blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be satisfied <span class="stiki" id="note361239"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;5:6</a></span> .</q> It is nothing bodily, nothing earthly, that this hunger, this thirst seeks for: but it desires to be satiated with the good food of righteousness, and wants to be admitted to all the deepest <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and be filled with the Lord Himself. Happy the mind that craves this food and is eager for such drink: which it certainly would not seek for if it had never tasted of its sweetness. But hearing the Prophet's spirit saying to him: <q>taste and see that the Lord is sweet ;</q> it has received some portion of sweetness from on high, and blazed out into <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the purest pleasure, so that spurning all things temporal, it is seized with the utmost eagerness for eating and drinking righteousness, and grasps the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of that first commandment which says: <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God out of all your heart, and out of all your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and out of all your strength :</q> since to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God is nothing else but to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> righteousness.  In fine, as in that passage the care for one's neighbour is joined to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so, too, here the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of mercy is linked to the desire for righteousness, and it is said:</p>

<h2>VII. The blessedness of the merciful</h2>

<p><q>Blessed are the merciful, for God shall have mercy on them <span class="stiki" id="note361243"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;5:7</a></span> .</q> Recognize, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, the worth of your wisdom, and understand to what rewards you are called, and by what methods of discipline you must attain thereto. Mercy wishes you to be merciful, righteousness to be righteous, that the Creator may be seen in His creature, and the image of God may be reflected in the mirror of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart expressed by the lines of imitation. The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those who do good  is free from anxiety: you shall have all your desires, and shall obtain without end what you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And since through your <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> all things are pure to you, to that blessedness also you shall attain which is promised in consequence where the Lord says:</p>

<h2>VIII. The blessedness of a pure heart</h2>

<p><q>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God <span class="stiki" id="note361245"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> .</q> Great is the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, beloved, of him for whom so great a reward is prepared. What, then, is it to have the heart pure, but to strive after those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which are mentioned above? And how great the blessedness of seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what mind can conceive, what tongue declare? And yet this shall ensue when man's nature is transformed, so that no longer <q>in a mirror,</q> nor <q>in a riddle,</q> but <q>face to face <span class="stiki" id="note361246"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:12</a></span> </q> it sees the very Godhead <q>as He is <span class="stiki" id="note361247"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:2</a></span>,</q> which no man could see ; and through the unspeakable <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> obtains that <q>which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has entered into the heart of man. </q> Rightly is this blessedness promised to purity of heart. For the brightness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light will not be able to be seen by the unclean sight: and that which will be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to minds that are bright and clean, will be a punishment to those that are stained. Therefore, let the mists of earth's vanities be shunned, and your inward eyes purged from all the filth of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, that the sight may be free to feed on this great manifestation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For to the attainment of this we understand what follows to lead.</p>

<h2>IX. The blessedness of peace-making</h2>

<p><q>Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the sons of God <span class="stiki" id="note361250"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;5:9</a></span> .</q> This blessedness, beloved, belongs not to any and every kind of agreement and harmony, but to that of which the Apostle speaks: <q>have peace towards God ;</q> and of which the Prophet David speaks: <q>Much peace have they that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Your law, and they have no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of offenses. </q> This peace even the closest ties of friendship and the exactest likeness of mind do not really gain, if they do not agree with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Similarity of bad desires, leagues in crimes, associations of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, cannot merit this peace. The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the world does not consort with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor does he enter the alliance of the sons of God who will not separate himself from the children of this generation.  Whereas they who are in mind always with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>giving diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace <span class="stiki" id="note361254"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;4:3</a></span>,</q> never dissent from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law, uttering that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <q>Your will be done as in heaven so on earth <span class="stiki" id="note361255"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;6:10</a></span> .</q> These are <q>the peacemakers,</q> these are thoroughly of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and fully harmonious, and are to be called sons <q>of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and joint-heirs with Christ <span class="stiki" id="note361256"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;8:17</a></span>,</q> because this shall be the record of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of our neighbour, that we shall suffer no calamities, be in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of no offense, but all the strife of trial ended, rest in God's most perfect peace, through our Lord, Who, with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, lives and reigns for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
