<h1>Spurious Epistles of St. Ignatius of Antioch</h1>

<h2>Epistle to the Tarsians</h2>

<h3>Greeting</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, who is also called Theophorus, to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is at Tarsus, saved in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, worthy of praise, worthy of remembrance, and worthy of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: Mercy and peace from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, be ever multiplied.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1. His own sufferings: exhortation to stedfastness</h3>

<p>From <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> even unto Rome I fight with beasts: not that I am devoured by brute beasts, for these, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, spared Daniel, but by beasts in the shape of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in whom the merciless wild beast himself lies hid, and pricks and wounds me day by day. But none of these hardships <q>move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011177"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse24">Acts&nbsp;20:24</a></span> in such a way as to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it better than the Lord. Wherefore I am prepared for [encountering] fire, wild beasts, the sword or the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, so that only I may see Christ my Saviour and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who died for me. I therefore, the prisoner of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who am driven along by land and sea, exhort you: <q>stand fast in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011178"><a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;16:13</a></span> and be steadfast, <q>for the just shall live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011179"><a href="../bible/hab002.htm#verse4">Habakkuk&nbsp;2:4</a>; <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse11">Galatians&nbsp;3:11</a></span> be unwavering, for <q>the Lord causes those to dwell in a house who are of one and the same character.</q> </p>

<h3>Chapter 2. Cautions against false doctrine</h3>

<p>I have learned that certain of the ministers of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> have wished to disturb you, some of them asserting that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was born [only ] in appearance, was crucified in appearance, and died in appearance; others that He is not the Son the Creator, and others that He is Himself God over all.  Others, again, hold that He is a mere man, and others that this flesh is not to rise again, so that our proper course is to live and partake of a life of pleasure, for that this is the chief good to beings who are in a little while to perish. A swarm of such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> has burst in upon us.  But you have not <q>given place by subjection to them, no, not for one hour.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011184"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse5">Galatians&nbsp;2:5</a></span> For you are the fellow citizens as well as the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who <q>fully preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> from Jerusalem, and round about unto <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011185"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;15:19</a></span> and bore about <q>the marks of Christ</q> in his flesh. <span class="stiki" id="note011186"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse17">Galatians&nbsp;6:17</a></span> </p>

<h3>Chapter 3. The true doctrine respecting Christ</h3>

<p>Mindful of him, by all means <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus the Lord</a> was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, being made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; and was as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> crucified. For, says he, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid that I should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, save in the cross of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011187"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;6:14</a></span> And He really suffered, and died, and rose again. For says [<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>], <q>If Christ should become passible, and should be the first to rise again from the dead.</q>  And again, <q>In that He died, He died unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> once: but in that He lives, He lives unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011189"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;6:10</a></span> Otherwise, what advantage would there be in [becoming subject to] bonds, if Christ has not died? What advantage in patience? What advantage in [enduring] stripes? And why such facts as the following: <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> was crucified; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and James were slain with the sword; John was banished to <a href="../cathen/11547a.htm">Patmos</a>; Stephen was <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned to death</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who killed the Lord? But, [in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,] none of these sufferings were in vain; for the Lord was really crucified by the ungodly.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4. Continuation</h3>

<p>And [<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, moreover], that He who was born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and He that was crucified was <q>the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of every creature,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011190"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse15">Colossians&nbsp;1:15</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, who also created all things. For says the apostle, <q>There is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of whom are all things; and  one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom are all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011191"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:6</a></span> And again, <q>For there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, and one Mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011192"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> and, <q>By Him were all things created that are in heaven, and on earth, visible and invisible; and He is before all things, and by Him all things consist.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011193"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse16">Colossians&nbsp;1:16-17</a></span> </p>

<h3>Chapter 5. Refutation of the previously mentioned errors</h3>

<p>And that He Himself is not God over all, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but His Son, He [shows when He] says, <q>I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011194"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;20:17</a></span> And again, <q>When all things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall He also Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011195"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:28</a></span> Wherefore it is one [Person] who put all things under, and who is all in all, and another [Person] to whom they were subdued, who also Himself, along with all other things, becomes subject [to the former].</p>

<h3>Chapter 6. Continuation</h3>

<p>Nor is He a mere man, by whom and in whom all things were made; for <q>all things were made by Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011196"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> <q>When He made the heaven, I was present with Him; and I was there with Him, forming [the world along with Him], and He rejoiced in me daily.</q>  And how could a mere man be addressed in such words as these: <q>Sit at My right hand?</q>  And how, again, could such an one declare: <q>Before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was, I am?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011199"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse58">John&nbsp;8:58</a></span> And, <q>Glorify Me with Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which I had before the world was?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011200"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;17:5</a></span> What man could ever say, <q>I came down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that sent Me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011201"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;6:38</a></span> And of what man could it be said, <q>He was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light, which lights every man that comes into the world: He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not. He came unto His own, and His own received Him not?</q>  How could such a one be a mere man, receiving the beginning of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from Mary, and not rather <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, and the only-begotten Son? For <q>in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note011203"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> and the Word was God.</q>  And in another place, <q>The Lord created Me, the beginning of His ways, for His ways, for His works. Before the world did He found Me, and before all the hills did He beget Me.</q> </p>

<h3>Chapter 7. Continuation</h3>

<p>And that our bodies are to rise again, He shows when He says, <q>Verily I say unto you, that the hour comes, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and they that hear shall live.</q>  And [says] the apostle, <q>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011207"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse53">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:53</a></span> And that we must live soberly and righteously, he [shows when he] says again, <q>Be not deceived: neither adulterers, nor effeminate <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, nor abusers of themselves with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, nor fornicators, nor revilers, nor drunkards, nor thieves, can inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011208"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:9</a></span> And again, <q>If the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised; our preaching therefore is vain, and your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is also vain: you are yet in your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in this life only we have hope in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we are of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> most miserable. If the dead rise not, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011209"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:13-32</a></span> But if such be our condition and feelings, wherein shall we differ from asses and dogs, who have no care about the future, but think only of eating, and of indulging  such appetites as follow after eating? For they are unacquainted with any intelligence moving within them.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8. Exhortations to holiness and good order</h3>

<p>May I have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of you in the Lord! Be sober. Lay aside, every one of you, all <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and beast-like fury, evil-speaking, <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, filthy speaking, ribaldry, whispering, arrogance, <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, vainglory, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and everything akin to these. <q>But put on the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> thereof.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011211"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;13:14</a></span> You <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, be subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; you <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>; and you, the people, to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. Let my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be for theirs who preserve this good order; and may the Lord be with them continually!</p>

<h3>Chapter 9. Exhortations to the discharge of relative duties</h3>

<p>You husbands, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your wives; and you wives, your husbands. You children, reverence your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. You <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, <q>bring up your children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011212"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse4">Ephesians&nbsp;6:4</a></span>  Honour those [who continue] in <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, as the priestesses of Christ; and the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> [that persevere] in gravity of behaviour, as the altar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You servants, wait upon your masters with [respectful] <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. You masters, issue orders to your servants with tenderness. Let no one among you be idle; for idleness is the mother of want. I do not enjoin these things as being a person of any consequence, although I am in bonds [for Christ]; but as a brother, I put you in mind of them. The Lord be with you!</p>

<h3>Chapter 10. Salutations</h3>

<p>May I enjoy your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>! <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a> that I may attain to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. I commend unto you the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. The Churches of Philippi,  whence also I write to you, salute you. Philo, your <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, to whom also I give thanks as one who has <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> ministered to me in all things, salutes you. Agathopus, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> from <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, who follows me in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, salutes you. <q>Salute one another with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011214"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:14</a></span> I salute you all, both male and female, who are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Fare well in body, and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and in one Spirit; and do not forget me. The Lord be with you!</p>

<h2>Epistle to the Antiochians</h2>

<h3>Greeting</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, who is also called Theophorus, to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> sojourning in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, which has obtained mercy from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and been elected by Christ, and which first <span class="stiki" id="note011215"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse26">Acts&nbsp;11:26</a></span> received the name Christ, [wishes] <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1. Cautions against error</h3>

<p>The Lord has rendered my bonds light and easy since I learned that you are in peace, that you live in all harmony both of the flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>. <q>I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord,  beseech you, that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011217"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse1">Ephesians&nbsp;4:1</a></span> guarding against those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one which have broken in upon us, to the deceiving and destruction of those that accept of them; but that you give heed to the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> both the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: that you reject every Jewish and Gentile <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and neither introduce a multiplicity of gods, nor yet deny Christ under the pretence of [maintaining] the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2. The true doctrine respecting God and Christ</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> also, when they speak as in the person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, [saying,] <q>I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the first [of beings], and I am also the last,  and besides Me there is no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011225"><a href="../bible/isa044.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;44:6</a></span> concerning the Father of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, do also speak of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. <q>A Son,</q> they say, <q>has been given to us, on whose shoulder the government is from above; and His name is called the Angel of great counsel, Wonderful, Counsellor, the strong and mighty God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011226"><a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;9:6</a></span> And concerning His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, <q>Behold, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall be with Child, and shall bring forth a Son; and they shall call his name Immanuel.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011227"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;7:14</a>; <a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;1:23</a></span> And concerning the passion, <q>He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before her shearers is dumb, I also was an innocent lamb led to be <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011228"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;53:7</a>; <a href="../bible/jer011.htm#verse19">Jeremiah&nbsp;11:19</a></span> </p>

<h3>Chapter 4. Continuation</h3>

<p>The Evangelists, too, when they declared that the one Father was <q>the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011229"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;17:3</a></span> did not omit what concerned our Lord, but wrote: <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God.

<h3>Chapter 5. Denunciation of false teachers</h3>

<p>Whosoever, therefore, declares that there is but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, only so as to take away the divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>,  and an enemy of all righteousness. He also that confesses Christ, yet not as the Son of the Maker of the world, but of some other unknown  being, different from Him whom the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have proclaimed, this man is an instrument of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. And he that rejects the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, and is ashamed of the cross for which I am in bonds, this man is antichrist.  Moreover, he who affirms Christ to be a mere man is accursed, according to the [declaration of the] <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note011239"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:5</a></span> since he puts not his trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in man. Wherefore also he is unfruitful, like the wild myrtle-tree.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6. Renewed cautions</h3>

<p>These things I write to you, you new olive-tree of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not that I am aware you hold any such opinions, but that I may put you on your guard, as a father does his children. Beware, therefore, of those that hasten to work mischief, those <q>enemies of the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whose end is destruction, whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is in their shame.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011240"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse18">Philippians&nbsp;3:18-19</a></span> Beware of those <q>dumb dogs,</q> those trailing serpents, those scaly  dragons, those asps, and basilisks, and scorpions. For these are subtle wolves,  and apes that mimic the appearance of men.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7. Exhortation to consistency of conduct</h3>

<p>You have been the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>; do not lose what was committed to your trust. Keep in remembrance Euodias,  your deservedly-blessed pastor, into whose hands the government over you was first entrusted by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Let us not bring disgrace upon our Father. Let us prove ourselves His true-born children, and not bastards. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> after what manner I have acted among you. The things which, when present, I spoke to you, these same, when absent, I now write to you. <q>If any man <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, let him be Anathema.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011244"><a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;16:22</a></span> Be followers of me. <span class="stiki" id="note011245"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:16</a></span> My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be for yours, when I attain to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. Remember my bonds. <span class="stiki" id="note011246"><a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse18">Colossians&nbsp;4:18</a></span> </p>

<h3>Chapter 8. Exhortations to the presbyters and others</h3>

<p>You <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, <q>feed the flock which is among you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011247"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:2</a></span> till God shall show who is to hold the rule over you. For <q>I am now ready to be offered,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011248"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:6</a></span> that I <q>may win Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011249"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;3:8</a></span> Let the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of what dignity they are, and let them study to be blameless, that they may be the followers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Let the people be subject to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. Let the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to whom they have <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> themselves.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9. Duties of husbands, wives, parents, and children</h3>

<p>Let the husbands <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their wives, remembering that, at the creation, one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and not many, was given to one man. Let the wives <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> their husbands, as their own flesh; and let them not presume to address them by their names. <span class="stiki" id="note011250"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:6</a></span> Let them also be chaste, reckoning their husbands as their only partners, to whom indeed they have been united according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, impart a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> training to your children. You children, <q><a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, that it may be well with you.</q> </p>

<h3>Chapter 10. Duties of masters and servants</h3>

<p>You masters, do not treat your servants with haughtiness, but imitate patient Job, who declares, <q>I did not despise  the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>  of my man-servant, or of my maid-servant, when they contended with me. For what in that case shall I do when the Lord makes an inquisition regarding me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011254"><a href="../bible/job031.htm#verse13">Job&nbsp;31:13-14</a></span> And you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what follows. You servants, do not provoke your masters to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in anything, lest you become the authors of incurable mischiefs to yourselves.</p>

<h3>Chapter 11. Inculcation of various moral duties</h3>

<p>Let no one addicted to idleness eat, <span class="stiki" id="note011255"><a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;3:10</a></span> lest he become a wanderer about, and a whoremonger. Let <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, reviling, clamour, and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> <q>be not so much as named among you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011256"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;5:3</a></span> Let not the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> live a life of pleasure, lest they wax wanton against the word. <span class="stiki" id="note011257"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:6,&nbsp;11</a></span> Be subject to C&aelig;sar in everything in which subjection implies no [spiritual] danger.  Provoke not those that rule over you to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, that you may give no occasion against yourselves to those that seek for it. But as to the practice of magic, or the impure <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of boys, or <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, it is superfluous to write to you, since such <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are forbidden to be committed even by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. I do not issue commands on these points as if I were an apostle; but, as your fellow-servant, I put you in mind of them.</p>

<h3>Chapter 12. Salutations</h3>

<p>I salute the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a>. I salute the sacred <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and that person most dear to me,  whom may I behold, through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, occupying my place when I shall attain to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be in place of his. I salute the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacons</a>, the readers, the singers, the doorkeepers, the labourers,  the exorcists, the confessors.  I salute the keepers of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> gates, the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. I salute the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of whom may I have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>.  I salute the people of the Lord, from the smallest to the greatest, and all my sisters in the Lord.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13. Salutations continued</h3>

<p>I salute Cassian and his partner in life, and their very dear children. <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, that most worthy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who is also deeply interested in you, salutes you; and to him I have commended you in the Lord. The whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Smyrn&aelig;ans, indeed, is mindful of you in their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the Lord. Onesimus, the pastor of the Ephesians, salutes you. Damas,  the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09533a.htm">Magnesia</a>, salutes you. Polybius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Trallians, salutes you. Philo and Agathopus, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, my companions, salute you, <q>Salute one another with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011263"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:12</a></span> </p>

<h3>Chapter 14. Conclusion</h3>

<p>I write this letter to you from Philippi. May He who is alone unbegotten, keep you steadfast both in the spirit and in the flesh, through Him who was begotten before time  began! And may I behold you in the kingdom of Christ! I salute him who is to bear rule over you in my stead: may I have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of him in the Lord! Fare well in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, being enlightened by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<h2>Epistle to Hero, a Deacon of Antioch</h2>

<h3>Greeting</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, who is also called Theophorus, to Hero, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a man honoured by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and most dearly loved as well as esteemed, who carries Christ and the Spirit within him, and who is my own son in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: Grace, mercy, and peace from Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, His only-begotten Son, <q>who gave Himself for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that He might deliver us from the present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> world,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011265"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;1:4</a></span> and preserve us unto His heavenly kingdom.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1. Exhortations to earnestness and moderation</h3>

<p>I Exhort you in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you add [speed] to your course, and that you vindicate your dignity. Have a care to preserve concord with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.

Do not altogether abstain from wine and flesh, for these things are not to be viewed with abhorrence, since [the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>] says, <q>You shall eat the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011269"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;1:19</a></span> And again, <q>You shall eat flesh even as herbs.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011270"><a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;9:3</a></span> And again, <q>Wine makes glad the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and oil exhilarates, and bread strengthens him.</q>  But all are to be used with moderation, as being the gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>For who shall eat or who shall drink without Him?

<h3>Chapter 2. Cautions against false teachers</h3>

<p>Every one that teaches anything beyond what is commanded, though he be [deemed] worthy of credit, though he be in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, though he live in continence, though he work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, though he have the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, let him be in your sight as a wolf in sheep's clothing, <span class="stiki" id="note011276"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;7:15</a></span> labouring for the destruction of the sheep. If any one denies the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and is ashamed of the passion, let him be to you as the adversary himself. <q>Though he gives all his goods to feed the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, though he remove mountains, though he give his body to be burned,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011277"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:2</a></span> let him be regarded by you as abominable. If any one makes light of the law or the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, which Christ fulfilled at His coming, let him be to you as antichrist. If any one says that the Lord is a mere man, he is a Jew, a murderer of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3. Exhortations as to ecclesiastical duties</h3>

<p><q>Honour <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> that are <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> indeed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011278"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:3</a></span> Be the friend of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>; for God is <q>the Father of the fatherless, and the Judge of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>.</q>  Do nothing without the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; for they are <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and you a servant of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. They <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>,  ordain, and lay on hands; but you minister to them, as the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Stephen  did at Jerusalem to James and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>. Do not neglect the sacred meetings  [of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>]; inquire after every one by name. <q>Let no man despise your youth, but be an example to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, both in word and conduct.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011282"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:12</a></span> </p>

<h3>Chapter 4. Servants and women are not to be despised</h3>

<p>Be not ashamed of servants, for we possess the same nature in common with them. Do not hold <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in abomination, for they have given you birth, and brought you up. It is fitting, therefore, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those that were the authors of our birth (but only in the Lord), inasmuch as a man can produce no children without a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. It is right, therefore, that we should <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> those who have had a part in giving us birth. <q>Neither is the man without the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> without the man,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011283"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:11</a></span> except in the case of those who were first formed. For the body of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was made out of the four elements, and that of Eve out of the side of Adam. And, indeed, the altogether peculiar birth of the Lord was of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> alone. [This took place] not as if the lawful union [of man and wife] were abominable, but such a kind of birth was fitting to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it became the Creator not to make use of the ordinary method of generation, but of one that was singular and strange, as being the Creator.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5. Various relative duties</h3>

Exhort my sisters to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and be content with their own husbands only. In like manner, exhort my brethren also to be content with their own wives.

<h3>Chapter 6. Exhortations to purity and caution</h3>

<p>Keep yourself pure as the habitation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You are the temple of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. You are the instrument of the Spirit. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what way I have brought you up. Though I am the least of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, seek to follow me, be an imitator of my conduct. I do not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the world, but in the Lord. I exhort Hero, my son; <q>but let him that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011288"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:31</a>; <a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:17</a></span> May I have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of you, my dear son, whose guardian may He be who is the only unbegotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>! Do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, do not place confidence in all; nor let any man get the better of you by flattery. For many are the ministers of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>; and <q>he that is hasty to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is light of heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011289"><a href="../bible/sir019.htm#verse4">Sirach&nbsp;19:4</a></span> </p>

<h3>Chapter 7. Solemn charge to Hero, as future bishop of Antioch</h3>

<p>Keep God in remembrance, and you shall never <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Be not double-minded <span class="stiki" id="note011290"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse6">James&nbsp;1:6,&nbsp;8</a></span> in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; for blessed is he who <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> not. For I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Father of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and in His only-begotten Son, that God will show me, Hero, upon my throne. Add speed, therefore,  to your course. I charge you before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and before Christ, and in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and of the ministering ranks [of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>], keep in safety that deposit which I and Christ have committed to you, and do not judge yourself unworthy of those things which have been shown by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> [to me] concerning you. I hand over to you the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a>. I have commended you to <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8. Salutations</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Onesimus, Bitus, Damas, Polybius, and all they of Philippi (whence also I have written to you), salute you in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Salute the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a> worthy of God: salute my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fellow <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, of whom may I have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, both in the flesh and in the spirit. Salute the people of the Lord, from the smallest to the greatest, every one by name; whom I commit to you as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did [the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>] to Joshua, who was their leader after him. And do not reckon this which I have said presumptuous on my part; for although we are not such as they were, yet we at least <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that we may be so, since indeed we are the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. Be strong, therefore, O Hero, like a hero, and like a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For from henceforth you shall lead <span class="stiki" id="note011292"><a href="../bible/deu031.htm#verse7">Deuteronomy&nbsp;31:7,&nbsp;23</a></span> in and out the people of the Lord that are in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and so <q>the congregation of the Lord shall not be as sheep which have no shepherd.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011293"><a href="../bible/num027.htm#verse17">Numbers&nbsp;27:17</a></span> </p>

<h3>Chapter 9. Concluding salutations and instructions</h3>

<p>Salute Cassian, my host, and his most serious-minded partner in life, and their very dear children,  to whom may <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grant that they find mercy of the Lord in that day,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011294"><a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:18</a></span> on account of their ministrations to us, whom also I commend to you in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Salute by name all the faithful in Christ that are at <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>. Do not neglect those at Tarsus, but look after them steadily, confirming them in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. I salute in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, Maris the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Neapolis, near Anazarbus. Salute also Mary my daughter, distinguished both for gravity and erudition, as also <q>the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is in her house.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011295"><a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse15">Colossians&nbsp;4:15</a></span> May my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be in place of hers: she is the very pattern of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. May the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by His only-begotten Son, preserve you in good health, and of high repute in all things, to a very old age, for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>! Farewell in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that I may be perfected.</p>

<h2>Epistle to the Philippians</h2>

<h3>Greeting</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, who is also called Theophorus, to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> which is at Philippi, which has obtained mercy in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and patience, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> unfeigned: Mercy and peace from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, <q>who is the Saviour of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, specially of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011296"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:10</a></span> </p>

<h3>Chapter 1. Reason for writing the epistle</h3>

<p>Being mindful of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and of your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which you have manifested towards us, we thought it fitting to write to you, who display such a godly and spiritual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the brethren,  to put you in remembrance of your <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> course,  <q>that you all speak the same thing, being of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, thinking the same thing, and walking by the same rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q>  as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> admonished you. For if there is one God of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>of whom are all things;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011300"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:6</a></span> and one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, our [Lord], <q>by whom are all things;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011301"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:6</a></span> and also one <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who wrought <span class="stiki" id="note011302"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:11</a></span> in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; and also one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which is administered that we should have fellowship with the death of the Lord;  and also one elect Church; there ought likewise to be but one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in respect to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For <q>there is one Lord, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; one God and Father of all, who is through all, and in all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011304"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;4:5</a></span> </p>

<h3>Chapter 2. Unity of the three divine persons</h3>

<p>There is then one God and Father, and not two or three; One who is; and there is no other besides Him, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> [God]. For <q>the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> says [the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>], <q>is one Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011305"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:4</a>; <a href="../bible/mar012.htm#verse29">Mark&nbsp;12:29</a></span> And again, <q>Has not one God created us? Have we not all one Father?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011306"><a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse10">Malachi&nbsp;2:10</a></span> And there is also one Son, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>. For <q>the only-begotten Son,</q> says [the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>], <q>who is in the bosom of the Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011307"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;1:18</a></span> And again, <q>One Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011308"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:6</a></span> And in another place, <q>What is His name, or what His Son's name, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011309"><a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse4">Proverbs&nbsp;30:4</a></span> And there is also one Paraclete.

And it is manifest that all these gifts [possessed by <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>] <q>works one and the self-same Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011314"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:11</a></span> There are not then either three Fathers,  or three Sons, or three Paracletes, but one Father, and one Son, and one Paraclete. Wherefore also the Lord, when He sent forth the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to make <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of all nations, commanded them to <q><a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011316"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> not unto one [person] having three names, nor into three [<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>] who became incarnate, but into three possessed of equal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3. Christ was truly born, and died</h3>

<p>For there is but One that became incarnate, and that neither the Father nor the Paraclete, but the Son only, [who became so] not in appearance or imagination, but in reality. For <q>the Word became flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011317"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> For <q>Wisdom built for herself a house.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011318"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;9:1</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was born as man, with a body, of the Virgin, without any intercourse of man. For [it is written], <q>A virgin shall conceive in her womb, and bring forth a son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011319"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;7:14</a></span> He was then <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> grew up, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> ate and drank, was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> crucified, and died, and rose again. He who believes these things, as they really were,  and as they really took place, is blessed. He who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> them not is no less accursed than those who crucified the Lord. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">prince of this world</a> rejoices when any one denies the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, since he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that the confession of the cross is his own destruction. For that is the trophy which has been raised up against his power, which when he sees, he shudders, and when he hears of, is afraid.</p>

<h3>Chapter 4. The malignity and folly of Satan</h3>

<p>And indeed, before the cross was erected, he (<a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>) was eager that it should be so; and he <q>wrought</q> [for this end] <q>in the children of disobedience.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011320"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;2:2</a></span> He wrought in Judas, in the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, in the old, in the young, and in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. But when it was just about to be erected, he was troubled, and infused repentance into the traitor, and pointed him to a rope to hang himself with, and taught him [to die by] strangulation. He terrified also the silly <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, disturbing her by dreams; and he, who had tried every means to have the cross prepared, now endeavoured to put a stop to its erection;  not that he was influenced by repentance on account of the greatness of his crime (for in that case he would not be utterly depraved), but because he perceived his own destruction [to be at hand]. For the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was the beginning of his condemnation, the beginning of his death, the beginning of his destruction. Wherefore, also, he works in some that they should deny the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, be ashamed of the passion, call the death an appearance, mutilate and explain away the birth of the Virgin, and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> the [<a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>] nature  itself as being abominable. He fights along with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to a denial of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniating</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>,  who are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> in holding that Christ possessed a mere phantasmal body.  For the leader of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> assumes manifold  forms, beguiler of men as he is, inconsistent, and even contradicting himself, projecting one course and then following another. For he is wise to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but as to what good may be he is totally <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. And indeed he is full of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, on account of his <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> want of reason: for how can he be deemed anything else who does not perceive reason when it lies at his very feet?</p>

<h3>Chapter 5. Apostrophe to Satan</h3>

<p>For if the Lord were a mere man, possessed of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body only, why do you mutilate and explain away His being born with the common nature of humanity? Why do you call the passion a mere appearance, as if it were any strange thing happening to a [mere] man? And why do you reckon the death of a mortal to be simply an imaginary death? But if, [on the other hand,] He is both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, then why do you call it unlawful to style Him <q>the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011326"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> who is by nature unchangeable? Why do you say that it is unlawful to declare of the Lawgiver who possesses a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <q>The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011327"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> and was a perfect man, and not merely one dwelling in a man? But how came this magician into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, who of old formed all nature that can be apprehended either by the senses or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father; and, when He became incarnate, healed every kind of disease and infirmity? <span class="stiki" id="note011328"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;4:23</a>,&nbsp;<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse35">Matthew&nbsp;9:35</a></span> </p>

<h3>Chapter 6. Continuation</h3>

<p>And how can He be but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who raises up the dead, sends away the lame sound of limb, cleanses the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, restores sight to the blind, and either increases or transmutes existing substances, as the five loaves and the two fishes, and the water which became wine, and who puts to flight your whole host by a mere word? And why do you abuse the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Virgin, and style her members disgraceful, since you displayed such of old in public processions,  and ordered them to be exhibited naked, males in the sight of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> to stir up the unbridled <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of males? But now these are reckoned by you disgraceful, and you pretend to be full of modesty, you spirit of fornication, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that then only anything becomes disgraceful when it is polluted by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. But when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not present, none of the things that have been created are shameful, none of them <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but all very good. But inasmuch as you are blind, you revile these things.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7. Continuation: inconsistency of Satan</h3>

<p>And how, again, does Christ not at all appear to you to be of the Virgin, but to be God over all,  and the Almighty? Say, then, who sent Him? Who was Lord over Him? And whose will did He <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>? And what <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> did He fulfil, since He was subject neither to the will nor power of any one? And while you deny that Christ was born,  you affirm that the unbegotten was begotten, and that He who had no beginning  was nailed to the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, by whose permission I am unable to say. But your changeable tactics do not escape me, nor am I <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that you are wont to walk with slanting and uncertain  steps. And you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> who really was born, you who pretend to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> everything.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8. Continuation: ignorance of Satan</h3>

<p>For many things are unknown  to you; [such as the following]: the <a href="../cathen/15448a.htm">virginity</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>; the wonderful birth; Who it was that became incarnate; the star which guided those who were in the east; the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> who presented gifts; the salutation of the archangel to the Virgin; the marvellous conception of her that was <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>; the announcement of the boy-forerunner respecting the son of the Virgin, and his leaping in the womb on account of what was foreseen; the songs of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> over Him that was born; the glad tidings announced to the shepherds; the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> lest his kingdom should be taken from him; the command to slay the infants; the removal into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and the return from that country to the same region; the infant swaddling-bands; the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> registration; the nourishing by means of milk; the name of father given to Him who did not beget; the manger because there was not room [elsewhere]; no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> preparation [for the Child]; the gradual growth, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> speech, hunger, thirst, journeyings, weariness; the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and then also <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; the voice of God over Him that was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, as to who He was and whence [He had come]; the testimony of the Spirit and the Father from above; the voice of John the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> when it signified the passion by the appellation of <q>the Lamb;</q> the performance of various <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, manifold healings; the rebuke of the Lord ruling both the sea and the winds; <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> expelled; you yourself subjected to torture, and, when afflicted by the power of Him who had been manifested, not having it in your power to do anything.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9. Continuation: ignorance of Satan</h3>

<p>Seeing these things, you were in utter perplexity.  And you were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that it was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> that should bring forth; but the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels'</a> song of praise struck you with astonishment, as well as the adoration of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, and the appearance of the star. You reverted to your state of [wilful] <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, because all the circumstances seemed to you trifling;  for you deemed the swaddling-bands, the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and the nourishment by means of milk contemptible:  these things appeared to you unworthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Again, beheld a man who remained forty days and nights without tasting <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> food, along with ministering <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> at whose presence you shuddered, when first of all you had seen Him <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> as a common man, and knew not the reason thereof. But after His [lengthened] fast you again assumed your wonted audacity, and tempted Him when hungry, as if He had been an ordinary man, not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knowing</a> who He was. For you said, <q>If you be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, command that these stones be made bread.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011337"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;4:3</a></span> Now, this expression, <q>If you be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,</q> is an indication of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. For if you had possessed real <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, you would have understood that the Creator can with equal ease both create what does not exist, and change that which already has a being. And you tempted by means of hunger  Him who nourishes all that require food. And you tempted the very <q>Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011339"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> forgetting in your malevolence that <q>man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For if you had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, you would also have understood that He who had kept his  body from feeling any want for forty days and as many nights, could have also done the same for ever. Why, then, does He suffer hunger? In order to prove that He had assumed a body subject to the same feelings as those of ordinary men. By the first fact He showed that He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by the second that He was also man.</p>

<h3>Chapter 10. Continuation: audacity of Satan</h3>

<p>Then dare you, who fell <q>as lightning</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011341"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;10:18</a></span> from the very highest <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, to say to the Lord, <q>Cast yourself down from hence</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011342"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;4:6</a></span> [to Him] to whom the things that are not are reckoned as if they were, <span class="stiki" id="note011343"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;4:17</a></span> and to provoke to a display of vainglory Him that was free from all ostentation? And did you pretend to read in Scripture concerning Him: <q>For He has given His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> charge concerning You, and in their hands they shall bear You up, lest you should dash Your foot against a stone?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011344"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;4:6</a></span> At the same time you pretended to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the rest, furtively concealing what [the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>] predicted concerning you and your servants: <q>You shall tread upon the adder and the basilisk; the lion and the dragon shall you trample under foot.</q> </p>

<h3>Chapter 11. Continuation: audacity of Satan</h3>

<p>If, therefore, you are trodden down under the feet of the Lord, how do you tempt Him that cannot be tempted, forgetting that precept of the lawgiver, <q>You shall not tempt the Lord your God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011346"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse16">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:16</a></span> Yea, you even dare, most accursed one, to appropriate the works of God to yourself, and to declare that the dominion over these was delivered to you. <span class="stiki" id="note011347"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse6">Luke&nbsp;4:6</a></span> And you set forth your own fall as an example to the Lord, and promise to give Him what is really His own, if He would fall down and worship you. <span class="stiki" id="note011348"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;4:9</a></span> And how did you not shudder, O you spirit more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> through your malevolence than all other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits, to utter such words against the Lord? Through your appetite  were you overcome, and through your vainglory were you brought to dishonour: through <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and ambition you [now] draw on [others] to ungodliness. You, O <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>, dragon, <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, crooked serpent, rebel against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, outcast from Christ, alien from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, exile from the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, reviler of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, enemy of all that is lawful, who rose up against the first-formed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and drove forth [from <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to] the commandment [of God] those who had in no respect injured you; you who raised up against Abel the murderous Cain; you who took arms against Job: do you say to the Lord, <q>If You will fall down and worship me?</q> Oh what audacity! Oh what <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>! You runaway slave, you incorrigible  slave, do you rebel against the good Lord? Do you say to so great a Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all that either the mind or the senses can perceive, <q>If You will fall down and worship me?</q></p>

<h3>Chapter 12. The meek reply of Christ</h3>

<p>But the Lord is long-suffering, and does not reduce to nothing him who in his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> dares [to utter] such words, but meekly replies, <q>Get you hence, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011351"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;4:10</a></span> He does not say, <q>Get behind Me,</q> for it is not possible that he should be converted; but, <q>Begone, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>,</q> to the course which you have chosen. <q>Begone</q> to those things to which, through your malevolence, you have been called. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Who I am, and by Whom I have been sent, and Whom it behooves Me to worship. For <q>you shall worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him only shall you serve.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011352"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;4:10</a>; <a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:13</a></span> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the one [God]; I am acquainted with the only [Lord] from whom you have become an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>. I am not an enemy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; I acknowledge His pre-eminence; I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who is the author of my generation.</p>

<h3>Chapter 13. Various exhortations and directions</h3>

<p>These things, brethren, out of the affection which I entertain for you, I have felt compelled to write, exhorting you with a view to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not as if I were a person of any consequence, but simply as a brother. Be subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. Love one another in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, as being the images of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Take heed, you husbands, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your wives as your own members. You wives also, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your husbands, as being one with them in virtue of your union. If any one lives in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> or continence, let him not be lifted up, lest he lose his reward. Do not lightly esteem the festivals. Despise not the period of forty days, for it comprises an imitation of the conduct of the Lord. After the week of the passion, do not neglect to fast on the fourth and sixth days, distributing at the same time of your abundance to the poor. If any one <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> on the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Lord's Day</a> or on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, except on the paschal <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> only, he is a murderer of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 14. Farewells and cautions</h3>

<p>Let your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> be extended to the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a>, whence also I as a prisoner am being led to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. I salute the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>; I salute the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Vitalius, and the sacred <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a>, and my fellow-servants the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>; in whose stead may my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be found. Once more I bid farewell to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> in the Lord. If any one celebrates the passover along with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, or receives the emblems of their feast, he is a partaker with those that killed the Lord and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 15. Salutations. Conclusion</h3>

<p>Philo and Agathopus the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> salute you. I salute the company of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and the order of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>; of whom may I have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>! I salute the people of the Lord, from the least unto the greatest. I have sent you this letter through Euphanius the reader, a man honoured of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and very faithful, happening to meet with him at Rhegium, just as he was going on board ship. Remember my bonds <span class="stiki" id="note011353"><a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse18">Colossians&nbsp;4:18</a></span> that I may be made perfect in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Fare well in the flesh, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the spirit, while you think of things perfect, and turn yourselves away from the workers of iniquity, who corrupt the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and are strengthened inwardly by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>The Epistle of Maria the Proselyte to Ignatius</h2> 

<h3>Greeting</h3>

<p>Maria, a <a href="../cathen/12481c.htm">proselyte</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, to <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius Theophorus</a>, most blessed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the apostolic Church which is at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, beloved in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>: Happiness and safety. We all  beg for you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and health in Him.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1. Occasion of the epistle</h3>

<p>Since Christ has, to our wonder,  been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> among us to be the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to have become man in these last times by means of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>,  of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, according to the announcements previously made regarding Him and through Him by the company of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, we therefore beseech and entreat that, by your wisdom, Maris our friend, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of our native Neapolis,  which is near Zarbus,  and Eulogius, and Sobelus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, be sent to us, that we be not destitute of such as preside over the divine word as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also says, <q>Let the Lord God look out a man who shall guide this people, and the congregation of the Lord shall not be as sheep which have no shepherd.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011360"><a href="../bible/num027.htm#verse16">Numbers&nbsp;27:16-17</a></span> </p>

<h3>Chapter 2. Youth may be allied with piety and discretion</h3>

<p>But as to those whom we have named being young men, do not, you blessed one, have any apprehension. For I would have you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are wise about the flesh, and are insensible to its <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, they themselves glowing with all the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of a hoary head through their own  intrinsic merits, and though but recently called as young men to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.  Now, call into exercise  your thoughts through the Spirit that God has given to you by Christ, and you will remember  that Samuel, while yet a little child, was called a seer, and was reckoned in the company of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that he reproved the aged Eli for transgression, since he had honoured his infatuated sons above God the author of all things, and had allowed them to go unpunished, when they turned the office of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> into ridicule, and acted violently towards your people.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3. Examples of youthful devotedness</h3>

<p>Moreover, the wise Daniel, while he was a young man, passed judgment on certain vigorous old man,  showing them that they were abandoned wretches, and not [worthy to be reckoned] elders, and that, though <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> by extraction, they were <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaanites</a> in practice. And Jeremiah, when on account of his youth he declined the office of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> entrusted to him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was addressed in these words: <q>Say not, I am a youth; for you shall go to all those to whom I send you, and you shall speak according to all that I command you; because I am with you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011366"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse7">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:7</a></span> And the wise Solomon, when only in the twelfth year of his age,  had wisdom to decide the important question concerning the children of the two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>,  when it was unknown to whom these respectively belonged; so that the whole people were astonished at such wisdom in a child, and venerated him as being not a mere youth, but a full-grown man. And he solved the hard questions of the queen of the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a>, which had profit in them as the streams of the Nile [have fertility], in such a manner that that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,  though herself so wise, was beyond measure astonished. </p>

<h3>Chapter 4. The same subject continued</h3>

<p>Josiah also, beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when as yet he could scarcely speak articulately, convicts those who were possessed of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirit as being false in their speech, and deceivers of the people. He also reveals the deceit of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and openly exposes those that are no gods; yea, while yet an infant he slays their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and overturns their altars, and defiles the place where <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were offered with dead bodies, and throws down the temples, and cuts down the groves, and breaks in pieces the pillars, and breaks open the tombs of the ungodly, that not a relic of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> might any longer exist.  To such an extent did he display <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of godliness, and prove himself a punisher of the ungodly, while he as yet faltered in speech like a child. David, too, who was at once a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and a king, and the root of our Saviour according to the flesh, while yet a youth is anointed by Samuel to be king. <span class="stiki" id="note011371"><a href="../bible/1sa016.htm">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;16</a></span> For he himself says in a certain place, <q>I was small among my brethren, and the youngest in the house of my father.</q> </p>

<h3>Chapter 5. Expressions of respect for Ignatius</h3>

<p>But time would fail me if I should endeavour to enumerate  all those that pleased God in their youth, having been entrusted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with either the prophetical, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a>, or the kingly office. And those which have been mentioned may suffice, by way of bringing the subject to your remembrance. But I entreat you not to reckon me presumptuous or ostentatious [in writing as I have done]. For I have set forth these statements, not as instructing you, but simply as suggesting the matter to the remembrance of my father in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my own place,  and do not compare myself with such as you. I salute your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and your Christ-loving people who are ruled under your care as their pastor. All the faithful with us salute you. Pray, blessed shepherd, that I may be in health as respects God.</p>

<h2>Epistle to Mary at Neapolis, Near Zarbus</h2>

<h3>Greeting</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, who is also called Theophorus, to her who has obtained mercy through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the Lord, who died for us, to Mary, my daughter, most faithful, worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and bearing Christ [in her heart], wishes abundance of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1. Acknowledgment of her excellence and wisdom</h3>

<p>Sight indeed is better than writing, inasmuch as, being one  of the company of the senses, it not only, by communicating <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of friendship, honours him who receives them, but also, by those which it in turn receives, enriches the desire for better things. But the second harbour of refuge, as the phrase runs, is the practice of writing, which we have received, as a convenient haven, by your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, from so great a distance, seeing that by means of a letter we have learned the excellence that is in you. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the good, O you wisest  of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>! resemble fountains of the purest water; for they allure by their beauty passers-by to drink of them, even though these should not be thirsty. And your intelligence invites us, as by a word of command, to participate in those divine draughts which gush forth so abundantly in your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2. His own condition</h3>

<p>But I, O blessed <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, not being now so much my own master as in the power of others, am driven along by the varying wills of many adversaries,  being in one sense in exile, in another in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and in a third in bonds. But I pay no regard to these things. Yea, by the injuries inflicted on me through them, I acquire all the more the character of a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, that I may attain to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. May I enjoy the torments which are prepared for me, seeing that <q>the sufferings of this present time are not worthy [to be compared] with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which shall be revealed in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011378"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;8:18</a></span> </p>

<h3>Chapter 3. He had complied with her request</h3>

<p>I have gladly acted as requested in your letter,  having no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> respecting those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom you <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be men of worth. For I am sure that you bore testimony to them in the exercise of a godly judgment,  and not through the influence of carnal favour. And your numerous quotations of Scripture passages exceedingly delighted me, which, when I had read, I had no longer a single doubtful thought respecting the matter. For I did not hold that those things were simply to be glanced over by my eyes, of which I had received from you such an incontrovertible demonstration. May I be in place of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the Son of the living God. Wherefore also He Himself says to you, <q>I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Me; and those that seek Me shall find peace.</q> </p>

<h3>Chapter 4. Commendation and exhortation</h3>

<p>Now it occurs to me to mention, that the report is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which I heard of you while you were at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the blessed father  Linus, whom the deservedly-blessed Clement, a hearer of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, has now succeeded. And by this time you have added a hundred-fold to your <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>; and may you, O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, still further increase it. I greatly desired to come unto you, that I might have rest with you; but <q>the way of man is not in himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011383"><a href="../bible/jer010.htm#verse23">Jeremiah&nbsp;10:23</a></span> For the military guard [under which I am kept] hinders my purpose, and does not permit me to go further. Nor indeed, in the state I am now in, can I either do or suffer anything. Wherefore deeming the practice of writing the second resource  of friends for their mutual encouragement, I salute your sacred <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, beseeching of you to add still further to your vigour. For our present labour is but little, while the reward which is expected is great.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5. Salutations and good wishes</h3>

<p>Avoid those that deny the passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and His birth according to the flesh: and there are many at present who suffer under this disease. But it would be absurd to admonish you on other points, seeing that you are perfect in every good work and word, and able also to exhort others in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Salute all that are like-minded with yourself, and who hold fast to their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and above all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Hero, salute you. Cassian my host salutes you, as well as my sister, his wife, and their very dear children. May the Lord sanctify you for evermore in the enjoyment both of bodily and spiritual health, and may I see you in Christ obtaining the crown!</p>

<h2>First Epistle to St. John</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, and the brethren who are with him, to John the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>.</p>

<p>We are deeply grieved at your delay in strengthening us by your addresses and consolations. If your absence be prolonged, it will disappoint many of us. Hasten then to come, for we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that it is expedient. There are also many of our <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> here, who are desirous to see Mary [the mother] of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and wish day by day to run off from us to you, that they may meet with her, and touch those breasts of hers which nourished the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, and may inquire of her respecting some rather secret matters. But Salome also, [the daughter of Anna,] whom you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, who stayed with her five months at Jerusalem, and some other well-known <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, relate that she is full of all graces and all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, after the manner of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, fruitful in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And, as they report, she is cheerful in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> and afflictions, free from murmuring in the midst of penury and want, grateful to those that injure her, and rejoices when exposed to troubles: she sympathizes with the wretched and the afflicted as sharing in their afflictions, and is not slow to come to their assistance. Moreover, she shines forth <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> as contending in the fight of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> against the pernicious conflicts of vicious  principles or conduct. She is the lady of our new religion and repentance,  and the handmaid among the faithful of all works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. She is indeed devoted to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and she humbles herself more devotedly than the devoted, and is wonderfully magnified by all, while at the same time she suffers detraction from the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>. Besides these points, many relate to us numerous other things regarding her. We do not, however, go so far as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> all in every particular; nor do we mention such to you. But, as we are informed by those who are worthy of credit, there is in Mary the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> an angelic purity of nature allied with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of humanity.  And such reports as these have greatly excited our emotions, and urge us eagerly to desire a sight of this (if it be lawful so to speak) heavenly prodigy and most sacred marvel. But do you in haste comply with this our desire; and fare well. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<h2>Second Epistle to St. John</h2>

<p>His friend  <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> to John the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>.</p>

<p>If you will give me leave, I desire to go up to Jerusalem, and see the faithful  <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are there, especially Mary the mother, whom they report to be an object of admiration and of affection to all. For who would not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> to behold and to address her who bore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God from her  own womb, provided he is a friend of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and religion? And in like manner [I desire to see] the venerable James, who is surnamed Just, whom they relate to be very like <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> in appearance,  in life, and in method of conduct, as if he were a twin-brother of the same womb. They say that, if I see him, I see also <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Himself, as to all the features and aspect of His body. Moreover, [I desire to see] the other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, both male and female. Alas! Why do I delay? Why am I kept back? Kind  teacher, bid me hasten [to fulfil my wish], and fare well. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<h2>The Epistle of Ignatius to the Virgin Mary</h2>

<p>Her friend  <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> to the Christ-bearing Mary.</p>

<p>You ought to have comforted and consoled me who am a <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of your [beloved] John. For I have heard things wonderful to tell respecting your [son] <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and I am astonished by such a report. But I desire with my whole heart to obtain information concerning the things which I have heard from you, who was always intimate and allied with Him, and who was acquainted with [all] His secrets. I have also written to you at another <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, and have asked you concerning the same things. Fare well; and let the neophytes who are with me be comforted of you, and by you, and in you. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<h2>Reply of the Blessed Virgin to this Letter</h2>

<p>The lowly handmaid of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> to <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, her beloved fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>.</p>

<p>The things which you have heard and learned from John concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Believe them, cling to them, and hold fast the profession of that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> which you have embraced, and conform your habits and life to your profession. Now I will come in company with John to visit you, and those that are with you. Stand fast in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note011393"><a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;16:13</a></span> and show yourself a man; nor let the fierceness of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> move you, but let your spirit be strong and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in God your Saviour. <span class="stiki" id="note011394"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;1:47</a></span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
