<h1>Supplement to De Viris Illustribis</h1>

<p><strong>Gennadius.</strong></p>

<p> <em>List of the Authors whom Gennadius added, after the Death of the Blessed Jerome. </em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>James,  surnamed the Wise, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Nisibis the famous city of the Persians and one of the confessors under Maximinus the persecutor. He was also one of those who, in the Nicean council, by their opposition overthrew the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> perversity of the Homoousia. That the blessed Jerome mentions this man in his <em>Chronicle</em> as a man of great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and yet does not place him in his catalogue of writers, will be easily explained if we note that of the three or four Syrians whom he mentions he says that he read them translated into the Greek. From this it is evident that, at that period, he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac language</a> or literature and therefore he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a writer who had not yet been translated into another language. All his writings are contained in twenty-six books namely <em>On <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, Against all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, On charity towards all, On <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, On <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, On particular affection towards our neighbor, On the resurrection, On the life after death, On humility, On penitence,  On satisfaction, On <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, On the worth</em>  <em>of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, On <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, On the blessed grapes, On the saying in Isaiah, <q>the grape cluster shall not be destroyed,</q> That Christ is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a> and consubstantial with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, On <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, Against the Nations, On the construction of the tabernacle, On the conversation of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, On the Persian kingdom, On the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</em> He composed also a <em>Chronicle</em> of little interest indeed to the Greeks, but of great reliability in that it is constructed only on the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>. It shuts the mouths of those who, on some daring guess, idly philosophize concerning the advent of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, or of our Lord. This man died in the time of Constantius and according to the direction of his father Constantine was buried within the walls of Nisibis, for the protection evidently of the city, and it turned out as Constantine had expected. For many years after, Julian having entered Nisibis and grudging either the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of him who was buried there or the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Constantine, whose <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> on account of this <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, ordered the remains of the saint to be carried out of the city, and a few months later, as a matter of public policy, the Emperor Jovian who succeeded Julian, gave over to the barbarians the city which, with the adjoining territory, is subject unto the Persian rule until this day.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>Julius,  <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, wrote to one Dionysius a single epistle <em>On the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of Our Lord</em>, which at that time was regarded as useful against those who asserted that, as by <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> there were two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so also there were two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, but now this too is regarded as injurious for it nourishes the Eutychian and Timothean <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>Paulonas,  the Presbyter, <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the blessed <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Ephraim a man of very energetic character and learned in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> scriptures was distinguished among the doctors of the church while his master was still living and especially as an extemporaneous orator. After the death of his master, overcome by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, separating himself from the church, he wrote many things opposed to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The blessed Ephraim when on the point of death is reported to have said to him as he stood by his side&mdash; See to it, Paulonas that you do not yield yourself to your own ideas, but when you shall think that you understand God wholly, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>&mdash;for he felt beforehand from the studies or the words of Paulonus, that he was investigating new things, and was stretching out his mind to the illimitable, whence also he frequently called him the new <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanes</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Vitellius </span> the African, defending the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> wrote <em>Why the servants of God are <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by the world</em>, in which, except in speaking of us as persecutors, he published excellent doctrine. He wrote also <em>Against the nations</em> and against us as traditors of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> in times of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and wrote much <em>On <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> procedure.</em> He was distinguished during the reign of Constans son of the emperor Constantinus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Macrobius </span> the Presbyter was likewise as I learned from the writings of Optatus, afterwards secretly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Donatians in Rome. He wrote, having been up to this time a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> in the church of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a work <em>To confessors and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a></em>, a work of ethics indeed, but of very necessary doctrine as well and fortified with sentiments well fitted for the preservation of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. He was distinguished first in our party in Africa and afterwards in his own, that is among the Donatians or <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Heliodorus </span> the Presbyter wrote a book entitled <em>An introductory treatise on the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things</em>, in which he showed that the beginning of things was one, that nothing was coaeval with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that God was not the creator of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but in such wise the creator of all good, that matter, which is used for  <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, was created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> after <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was discovered, and that nothing material whatever can be regarded as established in any other way than by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that there was no other creator than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who, when by His foreknowledge He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that nature was to be changed,  warned of punishment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Pachomius </span> the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, a man endowed with apostolic <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> both in teaching and in performing <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and founder of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, wrote an <em>Order of discipline</em> suited to both classes of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, which he received by angelic dictation. He wrote letters also to the associated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his district, in an alphabet concealed by mystic <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> so as to surpass customary <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and only manifest to those of special <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or desert, that is <em>To the Abbot Cornelius</em> one, <em>To the Abbot Syrus</em> one, and one <em>To the heads of all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a></em> exhorting that, gathered together to one very ancient <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which is called in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> language Bau, they should celebrate the day of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> together as by everlasting law. He urged likewise in another letter that on the day of remission, which is celebrated in the month of August, the chief <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should be gathered together to one place, and wrote one other letter to the brethren who had been sent to work outside the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Theodorus</span>,  successor to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and the headship of the above mentioned Abbot Pachomius, addressed to other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> letters written in the language of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, in which nevertheless he frequently mentions his master and teacher Pachomius and sets forth his doctrine and life as examples. This he had been taught he said by an Angel that he himself might teach again. He likewise exhorts them to remain by the purpose of their heart and desire, and to restore to harmony and unity those who, a dissension having arisen after the death of the Abbot, had broken the unity by separating themselves from the community. Three hortatory epistles of his are extant.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Oresiesis </span> the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, the colleague of both Pachomius and Theodorus, a man learned to perfection in Scripture,  composed a book seasoned with divine <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> and formed of the essentials of all monastic discipline and to speak moderately, in which almost the whole Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is found set forth in compact dissertations&mdash; all, at least, which relates to the special needs of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. This he gave to his brethren almost on the very day of his death leaving, as it were, a legacy.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>Macarius,  the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, distinguished for his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, wrote one letter which was addressed to the younger men of his profession. In this he taught them that he could serve God perfectly who, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the condition of his creation, should devote himself to all labours, and by wrestling against every thing which is agreeable in this life, and at the same time imploring the aid of God would attain also to natural purity and obtain continence, as a well merited gift of nature.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Evagrius </span> the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, the intimate <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the above mentioned Macarius, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in  sacred and profane literature and distinguished, whom the book which is called the <em>Lives of the fathers</em> mentions as a most continent and erudite man, wrote many things of use to <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> among which are these: <em>Suggestions against the eight principal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</em> He was first to mention or among the first at least to teach these setting against them eight books taken from the testimony of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> only, after the example of our Lord, who always met his tempter with quotations from Scripture, so that every suggestion, whether of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> or of depraved nature had a testimony against it. This work I have, under instructions, translated into Latin translating with the same simplicity which I found in the Greek. He composed also a book of <em>One hundred sentiments</em> for those living simply as <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a>, arranged by chapters, and one of <em>Fifty sentiments</em> for the erudite and studious, which I first translated into Latin. The former one, translated before, I restored, partly by retranslating and partly by emendation, so as to represent the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of the author, because I saw that the translation was vitiated and confused by time. He composed also a doctrine of the common-life suited to Cenobites and Synodites,  and to the virgin <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a little book suitable to her religion and sex. He published also a few collections of opinions very obscure and, as he himself says of them, only to be understood by the hearts of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and these likewise I published in Latin. He lived to old age, mighty in signs and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Theodorus</span>,  <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the church at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, a cautious investigator and clever of tongue, wrote against the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarians</a> and Anomians <em>On the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Lord</em>, fifteen books containing as many as fifteen thousand verses, in which he showed by the clearest reasoning and by the testimony of Scripture that just as the Lord Jesus had a plenitude of deity, so he had a plenitude of humanity. He taught also that man consists only of two substances, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body and that sense and spirit are not different substances, but inherent inborn faculties of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through which it is inspired and has rationality and through which it makes the body capable of feeling. Moreover the fourteenth book of this work treats wholly of the uncreated and alone incorporeal and ruling nature of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Trinity and of the rationality of animals which he explains in a devotional spirit, on the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>. In the fifteenth volume he confirms and fortifies the whole body of his work by citing the traditions of the fathers.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>Prudentius,  a man well versed in secular literature, composed a <em>Trocheum</em> of selected <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> from the whole Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. He wrote a commentary also, after the fashion of the Greeks, <em>On the six days of creation</em> from creation of the world until the creation of the first man and his fall. He wrote also short books which are entitled in the Greek, <em>Apotheosis, Psychomachia</em> and <em>Hamartigenia</em>, that is <em>On divinity, On spiritual conflict, On the origin of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</em> He wrote also <em>In praise of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a></em>, an invitation to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in one book citing several as examples and another of <em>Hymns</em>, but specially directed <em>Against Symmachus</em>  who defended <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, from which we learn that Palatinus was a soldier.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Audentius</span>,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, wrote a book against the Manicheans, Sabellians and <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and very particularly against the <a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinians</a> who are now called Bonosiacians. This book he entitled <em>On <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a></em>, and in it he showed the Son to have been coeternal with the Father and that He did not receive the beginning of his deity from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, at the time when conceived by the act of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he was born of the Virgin Mary his mother in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> humanity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Commodianus</span>,  while he was engaged in secular literature read also our writings and, finding opportunity, accepted the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Having become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> thus and wishing to offer the fruit of his studies to Christ the author of his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, he wrote, in barely tolerable semi-versified language, <em>Against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a></em>, and because he was very little acquainted with our literature he was better able to overthrow their [doctrine] than to establish ours. Whence also, contending against them concerning the divine counterpromises, he discoursed in a sufficiently wretched and so to speak, gross fashion, to their stupefaction and our despair. Following <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, Lactantius and <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a> as authorities he adopted and inculcated  in his students good ethical principles and especially a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of poverty.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Faustinus </span> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> wrote to Queen Flaccilla seven books <em>Against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and Macedonians</em>, arguing and convicting them by the testimonies of the very Scriptures which they used, in perverted meaning, for <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. He wrote also a book which, together with a certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> named Marcellinus, he addressed to the emperors Valentinianus, Theodosius and Arcadius, in defence of their fellow <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. From this it appears that he acquiesced in the Luciferian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, in that in this same book he blames Hilary of Poitiers and Damasus, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, for giving ill-advised counsel to the church, advising that the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should be received into communion for the sake of restoring the peace. For it was as displeasing to the Luciferians to receive the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who in the Ariminian council had communed with <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, as it was to the Novatians to receive the penitent <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p>Rufinus,  <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the church at Aquileia, was not the least among the doctors of the church and had a fine talent for elegant translation from Greek into Latin. In this way he opened to the Latin speaking church the greater part of the Greek literature; translating the works of Basil of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia, Gregory Nazianzan, that most eloquent man, the <em>Recognitions</em> of Clement of Rome, the <em>Church history</em> of Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea in Palestine, the <em>Sentences</em> of Xystus,  the <em>Sentences</em> of Evagrius and the work of Pamphilus Martyr <em>Against the mathematicians.</em> Whatever among all these which are read by the Latins have prefatory matter, have been translated by Rufinus, but those which are without Prologue have been translated by some one else who did not choose to write a prologue. Not all of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, however, is his work, for Jerome translated some which are identified by his prologue. On his own account, the same Rufinus, ever through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God published an <em>Exposition of the Apostles' creed</em> so excellent that other expositions are regarded as of no account in comparison. He also wrote in a threefold sense, that is, the historical, moral and mystical sense, on Jacob's blessing on the patriarchs. He wrote also many epistles exhorting to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, among which those which he addressed to Proba are pre&euml;minent. He added also a tenth and eleventh book to the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> which we have said was written by Eusebius and translated by him. Moreover he responded to a detractor of his works, in two volumes, arguing and proving that he exercised his talent with the aid of the Lord and in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the good of the church, while he, on the other hand, incited by jealousy had taken to polemics.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Tichonius</span>,  an African by nationality was, it is said, sufficiently learned in sacred literature, not wholly unacquainted with secular literature and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. He wrote books <em>On internal <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a></em> and <em>Expositions of various causes</em> in which for the defence of his friends, he cites the ancient councils and from all of which  he is recognized to have been a <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a>. He composed also eight <em>Rules for investigating and ascertaining the meaning of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a></em>, compressing them into one volume. He also expounded the Apocalypse of John entire, regarding nothing in it in a carnal sense, but all in a spiritual sense. In this exposition he maintained the angelical nature  to be corporeal, moreover he doubts that there will be a reign of the righteous on earth for a thousand years after the resurrection, or that there will be two resurrections of the dead in the flesh, one of the righteous and the other of the unrighteous, but maintains that there will be one simultaneous resurrection of all, at which shall arise even the aborted and the deformed lest any living <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, however deformed, should be lost. He makes such distinction to be sure, between the two resurrections as to make the first, which he calls the apocalypse of the righteous, only to take place in the growth of the church where, justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they are raised from the dead bodies of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to the service of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, but the second, the general resurrection of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in the flesh. This man flourished at the same period with the above mentioned Rufinus during the reign of Theodosius and his sons.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Severus </span> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, surnamed Sulpitius,  of the province of Aquitania, a man distinguished by his birth, by his excellent literary work, by his devotion to poverty and by his humility, beloved also of the sainted men Martin <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Tours and Paulinus Nolanus, wrote small books which are far from despicable. He wrote to his sister many <em>Letters</em> exhorting to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and contempt of the world. These are well known. He wrote two to the above mentioned Paulinus Nolanus and others to others, but because, in some, <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> matters are included, they have not been collected for publication. He composed also a <em>Chronicle</em>, and wrote also to the profit of many, a <em>Life of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Martin</em>, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a man famous for signs and wonders and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.  He also wrote a <em>Conference between Postumianus and Gallus</em>, in which he himself acted as mediator and judge of the debate. The subject matter was the manner of life of the oriental <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and of St. Martin&mdash; a sort of dialogue in two divisions. In the first of these he mentions a decree of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the synod of Alexandria in his own time to the effect that <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> is to be read, though cautiously, by those who are wise, for the good that is in him, and is to be rejected by the less able on account of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In his old age, he was led astray by the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, and recognizing the guilt of much speaking, kept silent until his death, in order that by penitent silence he might atone for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which he had contracted by speaking.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Antiochus </span> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, wrote one long  volume <em>Against <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a></em> and he composed a homily, full of  godly penitence and humility <em>On the healing of the blind man</em> whose sight was restored by the Saviour. He died during the reign of the emperor Arcadius.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21</h2>

<p>Severianus,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church of Gabala, was learned in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> and a wonderful preacher of homilies. On this account he was frequently summoned by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John and the emperor Arcadius to preach a sermon at Constantinople. I have read his <em>Exposition of the epistle to the Galatians</em> and a most attractive little work <em>On <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the feast of Epiphany.</em> He died in the reign of Theodosius, his son by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22</h2>

<p>Niceas,   <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of Romatia, composed, in simple and clear language, six books of <em>Instruction for neophites.</em> The first of these contains, How candidates who seek to obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> ought to act, the second, On the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of relationship, in which he relates that not far from his own time a certain Melodius, father of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, on account of his liberality and Garadius  a peasant, on account of his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a>, were placed, by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, among the gods. A third book <em>On <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in one sovereign</em>, a fourth <em>Against genealogy</em>,  a fifth <em>On the creed</em>, a sixth <em>On the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the paschal lamb.</em> He addressed a work also <em>To the fallen virgin</em>, an incentive to amendment for all who have fallen.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Olympius </span> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a Spaniard by nationality, wrote a book of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> against those who blame nature and not the will, showing that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was introduced into nature not by creation but by disobedience.</p>

<p>Bachiarius,  a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, prompt and ready and minded to devote his time to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, chose travel as a means of preserving the integrity of his purpose. He is said to have published acceptable small works but I have only read one of them, a work <em>On <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em>, in which he justified himself to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the city, defending himself against those who complained and misrepresented his travel, and asserting that he undertook his travel not through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of men but for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that going forth from his land and kindred he might become a co-heir with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> the patriarch.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Sabbatius</span>,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Gallican province, at the request of a certain virgin, chaste and devoted to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Secunda by name, composed a book <em>On <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em> against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> his teacher, also against Eunomius and his Master A&euml;tius, showing, both by reason and by testimony of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, that the origin of the deity is one, that the Author of his <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and the Creator of the earth out of nothing, are one and the same, and likewise concerning Christ, that he did not appear as man in a phantasm but had real flesh through which eating, drinking, weary and weeping, suffering, dying, rising again he was demonstrated to be man indeed. For <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> had been opposed to these opinions asserting that the origin of Deity is twofold and that Christ came in a phantasm. To A&euml;tius indeed and Eunomius his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, he showed that the Father and Son are not of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> and equal in divinity but of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and the one from the other, that is the Son from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the one coeternal with the other, which belief A&euml;tius and Eunomius opposed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Isaac </span> wrote <em>On the Holy Trinity</em> and a book <em>On the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Lord</em>, writing in a very obscure style of argument and involved language, maintaining that three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> exist in one Deity, in such wise that any thing may be peculiar to each which another does not have, that is to say, that the Father has this peculiarity that He, himself without source, is the source of others, that the Son has this peculiarity, that, begotten, He is not posterior to the begetter, that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> has this peculiarity, that He is neither made nor begotten but nevertheless is from another. Of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Lord indeed, he writes that the person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be one, while yet there are two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> existing in him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Ursinus </span> the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> wrote against those who say that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be rebaptized, teaching  that it is not legitimate nor honouring <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that those should be rebaptized who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> either in the name of Christ alone or in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, though the formula has been used in a vitiated sense. He considers that after the simple confession of the Holy Trinity and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the imposition of the hands of the catholic <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is sufficient for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Macarius </span> another <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, wrote at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> books <em>Against the mathematicians</em>, in which labour he sought the comfort of oriental writings.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Heliodorus, </span> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, published an excellent volume gathered from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> <em>On Virginity.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 30</h2>

<p>[<span class="sc">John </span>  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople, a man of marvelous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of life, in every respect worthy of imitation, wrote many and very useful works for all who are hastening to divine things.

<h2>Chapter 31</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Another John, </span>  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Jerusalem, wrote a book against those who disparaged his studies, in which he shows that he follows the genius of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> not his creed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> wrote a short work <em>On penitence</em> in which he lays down this law for penitents; that they ought to repent for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in such manner that they be not beyond measure overwhelmed with despairing sadness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Helvidius, </span> a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Auxentius and imitator of Symmachus, wrote, indeed, with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for religion but not according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, a book, polished neither in language nor in reasoning, a work in which he so attempted to twist the meaning of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> to his own perversity, as to venture to assert on their testimony that <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, after the nativity of our Lord, had children who were called brothers of the Lord. In reply to his perverseness Jerome, published a book against him, well filled with scripture <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 34</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Theophilus, </span> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church  of Alexandria, wrote one great volume <em>Against <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a></em> in which he condemns pretty nearly all his sayings and himself likewise, at the same time saying that he was not original in his views but derived them from the ancient fathers especially from Heraclas, that he was deposed from  the office of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> driven from the church and compelled to fly from the city. He also wrote <em>Against the Anthropomorphites</em>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who say that God has the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form and members, confuting in a long discussion and arguing by testimonies of Divine Scripture and convincing. He shows that, according to the belief of the Fathers, God is to be thought of as incorporal, not formed with any suggestion of members at all, and therefore there is nothing like Him among <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things in substance, nor has the incorruptibility nor unchangeableness nor incorporeality of his nature been given to any one but that all intellectual natures are corporeal, all corruptible, all mutable, that He alone should not be subject to corruptibility or changeableness, who alone has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and life. Likewise the return of the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">paschal feast</a> which the great council at Nicea had found would take place after ninety years at the same time, the same month and day adding some observations on the festival and explanations he gave to the emperor Theodosius. I have read also three books <em>On <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em>, which bear his name but, as their language is not like his, I do not very much think they are by him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Eusebius </span> wrote <em>On the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our Lord's cross</em> and the faithfulness of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and especially of Peter, gained by virtue of the cross.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Vigilantius, </span> a citizen of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, had the church of Barcelona. He wrote also with some <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for religion but, overcome by the desire for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise and presuming above his strength, being a man of polished language but not practised in the meaning of Scriptures, he expounded the vision of Daniel in a perverted sense and said other frivolous things which are necessarily mentioned in a catalogue of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. [To him also the blessed Jerome the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> responded.] </p>

<h2>Chapter 37</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Simplicianus, </span> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, exhorted Augustine then <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, in many letters, that he should exercise his genius and take time for exposition of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> that, as it were, a new Ambrosius, the task master of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> might appear. Wherefore also he sent to him many examinations of scriptures. There is also an epistle of his of <em>Questions</em> in which he teaches by asking questions as if wishing to learn.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Vigilius </span> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> wrote to one Simplicianus a small book <em>In praise of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a></em> and an epistle containing the acts of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in his time among the barbarians.</p>

For who is there that can boast himself of having all his works, or who reads with such diligence as to read all he has written?  As an old man even, he published fifteen books <em>On the Trinity</em> which he had begun as a young man. In which, as scripture says, brought into the chamber of the king and adorned with the manifold garment of the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he exhibited a church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing. In his work <em>On the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Lord</em> also he manifested a peculiar <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. On the resurrection of the dead he wrote with equal sincerity, and left it to the less able to raise doubts respecting abortions.  </p>

<h2>Chapter 40</h2>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/11322a.htm">Orosius</a>, </span> a Spanish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, a man most eloquent and learned in history, wrote eight books against those enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who say that the decay of the Roman State was caused by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. In these rehearsing the calamities and miseries and disturbances of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, of pretty much the whole world from the creation  he shows that the Roman Empire owed to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> its undeserved continuance and the state of peace which it enjoyed for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>In the first book he described the world situated within the ever flowing stream of Oceanus and intersected by the Tanais, giving the situations of places, the names, number and customs of nations, the characteristics of various regions, the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> begun and the formation of empires sealed with the blood of kinsmen.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="../cathen/11322a.htm">Orosius</a> who, sent by Augustine to Hieronymus to teach the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, returning, was the first to bring to the West relics of the blessed Stephen the first <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> then recently found.

He wrote also two treatises, <em>On the life</em>  <em>of Saint Eusebius</em>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Vercelli, and confessor, and <em>On Saint Cyprian</em>, and published a monograph <em>On the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</em> I have read his <em>On <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, On hospitality, On the eclipse of the moon, On almsgiving, On the saying in Isaiah, Your winedealers mix wine with water, On Our Lord's Passion</em>, A general treatise <em>On <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> by the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, On the quadragesimal fast</em> in particular, and <em>That there should be no jesting on fast day, On Judas</em>, the betrayer, <em>On Our Lord's cross, On His sepulchre, On His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, On the accusation and trial of Our Lord before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, On the Kalends of January</em>, a homily <em>On the day of Our Lord's Nativity</em>, also homilies <em>On Epiphany, On the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, On Pentecost</em>, many also, <em>On having no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of carnal Foes, On giving thanks after meat, On the repentance of the Ninivites</em>, and other homilies of his, published  on various occasions, whose names I do not remember.

This I think is to be accepted, for the author of the work describes himself as a pr&aelig;torian prefect. He died in the reign of Theodosius and Valentinianus.</p>

He wrote also a <em>Sacramentary</em> and <em>Hymnal.</em></p>

<p>He also addressed many letters to his sister, <em>On contempt of the world</em>, and published treatises of different sorts, on various occasions. </p>

<p>The most notable of all his minor works are the works <em>On repentance</em>, and <em>A general panegyric of all the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>.</em> He lived in the reign of Honorius and Valentinianus, and was distinguished, not only for erudition  and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life, but also for his ability to cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</p>

But afterwards, when commended by his eloquence and abstemiousness he had been made pontiff of the church at Constantinople, showing openly what he had for a long while concealed, he became a declared enemy of the church, and wrote a book <em>On the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Lord</em>, formed of sixty-two passages from Divine Scripture, used in a perverted meaning.

But having been admonished by the Gallican doctors, and corrected by Augustine in Africa, he wrote a book containing his retraction, in which he both acknowledges his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and returns thanks for his correction. At the same time in correction of his false view of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he presented the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> view, acknowledging the single person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> existing in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in his substance. </p>

<h2>Chapter 61</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Victorinus, </span> a rhetorician of Marseilles, wrote to his son Etherius, a commentary <em>On Genesis</em>, commenting, that is, from the beginning of the book to the death of the patriarch <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and published four  books in verse, words which have a savour of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> indeed, but, in that he was a man busied with secular literature and quite untrained in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>, they are of slight weight, so far as ideas are concerned.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hilary, </span> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church at Arles, a man learned in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, was devoted to poverty, and earnestly anxious to live in narrow circumstances, not only in religiousness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but also in labour of body. To secure this estate of poverty, this man of noble race and very differently brought up, engaged in farming, though it was beyond his strength, and yet did not neglect spiritual matters. He was an acceptable teacher also, and without regard to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> administered correction to all.  He published some few things, brief, but showing <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> genius, and indicating an erudite <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as well as capacity for vigorous speech; among these that work which is of so great practical value to many, his <em>Life of Saint Honoratus</em>, his predecessor.

In this he advises Flavianus, if Eutyches confesses his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and promises amendment, to receive him, but if he should persist in the course he had entered on, that he should be condemned together with his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. He likewise teaches in this epistle and confirms by divine testimony that as the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> is to be considered the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> son of the Divine Father, so likewise he is to be considered <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that is, that he derived a body of flesh from the flesh of the virgin and not as Eutyches asserted, that he showed a body from heaven.

The readers in the church found this work of the greatest value, in that it saved them trouble and anxiety in the selection of passages, and was useful for the instruction of the people as well as for the dignity of the service. He also addressed to Saint Eustathius  the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, successor to the above mentioned man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, an excellent and sizable volume, a <em>Sacramentary</em>,  divided into various sections, according to the various offices and seasons, Readings and Psalms, both for reading and chanting, but also filled throughout with petitions to the Lord,  and thanksgiving for his benefits.

He is said to have also delivered homilies, which are, as I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, valued by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men, but which I have not read.

Finally he declined to accept the decree of the council of Chalcedon, and did not think the doctrine that after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> comprehended two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, was to be acquiesced in.</p>

<h2>Chapter 85</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Prosper </span> of Aquitania, a man scholastic in style and vigorous in statement, is said to have composed many works, of which I have read a <em>Chronicle</em>, which bears his name, and which extends from the creation of the first man, according to Divine Scripture, until the death of the Emperor Valentinianus and the taking of Rome by Genseric king of the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>. I regard as his also an anonymous book against certain works of Cassianus, which the church of God finds salutary, but which he brands as injurious, and in fact, some of the opinions of Cassian and Prosper on the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and on <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> are at variance with one another.

He published also an excellent work, <em>On the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through which we are saved</em>,  in which he teaches that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God always invites, precedes  and helps our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and whatever gain that freedom of will may attain for its <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> effect, is not its own desert, but the gift of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. I have read also a little book of his <em>Against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and Macedonians</em>, in which he posits a co&euml;ssential Trinity, and another against those who say that there is anything incorporeal in <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, in which he maintains from the testimony of Scriptures, and by quotations from the fathers, that nothing is to be regarded as incorporeal but God. There is also a letter of his, written in the form of a little book, and addressed to a certain <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, named Graecus, who, leaving the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, had gone over to the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> impiety.</p>

There are still other works by him, but as I have not read, I do not care to mention them. This excellent doctor is enthusiastically <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in and admired. He wrote afterwards also to Felix, the Pr&aelig;tonian prefect, and a man of Patrician rank, son of Magnus the consul, a very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> letter, exhorting to the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a work well fitted to induce one to repent with his whole heart.</p>

This letter was an exhortation to endure hardness for Christ and fortified by modern examples and scripture illustrations showing that perseverance in the confession of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> not only purges past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> but also procures the blessing of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p>
