<h1>Synod of Antioch in Encaeniis (A.D. 341)</h1>

<h2>Historical Introduction</h2>

<p>Of the Synod of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> which adopted the canons subsequently received into the code of the universal church we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the exact date. This is fixed by the fact that the synod was held at the time of the dedication of the great church in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the <q>Golden,</q> which had been begun by his father, <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, and was finished in the days of Constantius. The synod has for this reason always been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the Synod of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> <em>in Enc&aelig;niis</em>, i.e., at the dedication (<em>in Dedicatione</em>), and was holden in the summer of the year 341. Ninety-seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled together and a large number of them were hostile to St. Athanasius, being professed Eusebians, all of them were Orientals and most of them belonged to the patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. Not a single Western or Latin <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was present and the pope, Julius, was in no way represented. This fact gave Socrates the historian the opportunity of making the statement (around which such polemics have raged), that <q>an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> canon commands that the churches should not make decrees against the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>.</q> </p>

<p>But while this much is all clear, there is no council that presents a greater amount of difficulty to the historian as well as to the theologian. No one can deny that St. Hilary of Poictiers, who was a contemporary, styled it a Synod of Saints (Synodus Sanctorum) ; that two of its canons were read at Chalcedon as the <q>canons of the Holy Fathers</q>; and that Popes John II, Zacharias, and Leo IV all approved these canons, and attributed them to <q>Holy Fathers.</q> And yet this synod set forth creeds to rival that of Nice, and, it is said, that some of the canons were adopted to condemn Athanasius.</p>

<p>Various attempts have been made to escape from these difficulties.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that there really were two Synods at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, the one <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, which adopted the canons, the other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>.</p>

<p>Father Emanuel Schelstraten, S. J.  improved on this theory. He supposed that the Eusebians stopped behind in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> after the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> left and then passed the decrees against Athanasius, giving out that the synod was still in session. This has been adopted by Pagi, Remi Ceillier, Walch, and to a certain extent by Schr&ouml;ckh and others. But Tillemont demurs to this view, urging that according to Socrates  the deposition of Athanasius came first and the adoption of the canons afterwards. But Tillemont would seem to have misunderstood Socrates on this point and this objection falls to the ground. But another objection remains, viz., that both Socrates and Sozomen say that the creeds were drawn up <em>after</em> the deposition of Athanasius, <q>and yet</q> (as <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a> remarks, Vol. II., p. 63), <q>St. Hilary says that these creeds proceeded from a &#8216;Synod of Saints.'</q></p>

<p>Schelstraten's hypothesis not being satisfactory, the learned Ballerini, in their appendix to the <em>Opera S. Leonis M</em>., have set forth another theory with which Mansi agrees in his <q>Notes on Alexander Natalis's <em>Church History</em>.</q> These maintain that the canons did not come from the Council <em>in Enc&aelig;niis</em> at all, but from another synod held before, in 332; but <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a> rejects this hypothesis altogether, on the following grounds. First and chiefest because it has no external evidence to support it; and secondly because the internal evidence is most unsatisfactory. But even if the 25 canons were adopted by a synod at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in 332, the real difficulty would not be obviated, for Socrates says  of that synod that there too the <q>opposers of the Nicene <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></q> were able to elect their candidate to fill the place of the banished <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Eustathius!</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a> seems to give the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> solution of the whole difficulty when he says: <q>Certainly Athanasius identified the Eusebians with the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and we regard them as at least Semi-arians; but at that time, after they had made the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and repeatedly declared their disapproval of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> condemned at Nice, they were considered, by the greater number, as lawful <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and thoroughly <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> and saintly men might without hesitation unite with them at a synod.</q> </p>

<p>Pope Julius styles the very Eusebian synod that deposed Athanasius <q>dear brethren</q> while blaming their action, and invited them to a common synod to enquire into the charges made against the Saint. In view of all this we may well <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that both <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> and Eusebians met together at the consecration of the Emperor's new church, and that the whole church afterwards awarded the canons then adopted a rank in accordance with their intrinsic worth, and without any regard to the motives or shades of theological opinion that swayed those who drafted and voted for them.</p>

<h2>The Synodal Letter</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and most peaceful Synod which has been gathered together in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> from the provinces of C&oelig;le-<a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>, Palestine, Arabia, Mesopotamia, Cilicia, and Isauria;  to our like-minded and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fellow Ministers in every Province, health in the Lord.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a> has regarded the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of the Antiochians</a>, and, by joining it together with unity of mind and concord and the Spirit of Peace, has likewise bettered many other things; and in them all this betterment is wrought by the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and peace-giving Spirit. Wherefore, that which after much examination and investigation, was unanimously agreed upon by us <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who coming out of various Provinces have met together in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, we have now brought to your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; trusting in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of Peace, that you also will agree with us and stand by us as far as in you lies, striving with us in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and being even more united with us, following the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, uniting in our definitions, and decreeing the same things as we; you, in the concord which proceeds of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, sealing and confirming what has been determined.</p>

<p>Now the Canons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which have been settled are hereto appended.</p>

<h2>The Canons</h2>

<h3>Canon 1</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Whosoever</span> shall presume to set aside the decree of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and great Synod which was assembled at Nice in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Emperor Constantine, beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, concerning the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and salutary feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>; if they shall obstinately persist in opposing what was [then] rightly ordained, let them be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and cast out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; this is said concerning the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. But if any one of those who preside in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whether he be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, shall presume, after this decree, to exercise his own private judgment to the subversion of the people and to the disturbance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, by observing <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> [at the same time] with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod decrees that he shall thenceforth be an alien from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as one who not only heaps <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> upon himself, but who is also the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of destruction and subversion to many; and it deposes not only such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> themselves from their ministry, but those also who after their deposition shall presume to communicate with them. And the deposed shall be deprived even of that external <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, of which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Canon and God's <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> partake.</p>

<h3>Canon 2</h3>

<p>All who enter the church of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and hear the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, but do not communicate with the people in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, or who turn away, by reason of some disorder, from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> partaking of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, are to be cast out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, until, after they shall have made confession, and having brought forth the fruits of penance, and made earnest entreaty, they shall have obtained forgiveness; and it is unlawful to communicate with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or to assemble in private houses and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with those who do not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; or to receive in one Church those who do not assemble with another Church. And, if any one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, or any one in the Canon shall be found communicating with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, let him also be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, as one who brings confusion on the order of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki"> <a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">John Zonaras</a>: In this canon the Fathers refer to such as go to church but will not tarry to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> nor receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">holy Communion</a>, held back by some perversity or license, that is to say without any just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but petulantly, and by reason of some disorder [<span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03BE;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>]; these are forbidden to be expelled from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that is to say cut off from the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. But the Fathers call it a turning away from, not a <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the divine Communion, which holds them back from communion; a certain kind of flight from it, brought about perchance by reverence and lowliness of mind. Those who object to communicate by reason of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> or disgust, such must be punished not with mere separation, but by an altogether absolute excommunication, and be cursed with <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. </span> </p>

<h3>Canon 3</h3>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or any one whatever belonging to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, shall forsake his own parish, and shall depart, and, having wholly changed his residence, shall set himself to remain for a long time in another parish, let him no longer officiate; especially if his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall summon and urge him to return to his own parish and he shall disobey. And if he persist in his disorder, let him be wholly deposed from his ministry, so that no further room be left for his restoration. And if another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall receive a man deposed for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, let him be punished by the Common Synod as one who nullifies the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Compare with Canons of the Apostles xv. and xvi.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 4</h3>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who has been deposed by a synod, or any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who has been deposed by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall presume to execute any part of the ministry, whether it be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> according to his former custom, or a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, he shall no longer have any prospect of restoration in another Synod; nor any opportunity of making his defence; but they who communicate with him shall all be cast out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and particularly if they have presumed to communicate with the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> aforementioned, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the sentence pronounced against them.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">This canon derives its chief interest from the fact that it is usually considered to have been adopted at the instigation of the party opposed to St. Athanasius and that afterwards it was used against St. Chrysostom. But while such may have been the secret reason why some voted for it and others prized it, it must be remembered that its provision is identical with that of the Apostolic Canons, and that it was read at the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> as Canon eighty-three. Remi Ceillier (<em>Histoire Gen&eacute;ral des Autheurs</em>, p. 659) tries to prove that this is not the canon which St. Chrysostom and his friends rejected, but <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a> thinks his position <q>altogether untenable</q> (<em>Hist. of the Councils</em>, Vol. II., p. 62, n. 1), and refers to Tillemont (<em>M&eacute;moires</em>, p. 329, <em>Sur les <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a></em>, and Fuchs' <em>Bib. der Kirchenversammlungen</em>, P. II., p. 59. ). (Compare Apostolic Canon 28.)</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 5</h3>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, despising this own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, has separated himself from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and gathered a private assembly, and set up an altar; and if, when summoned by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he shall refuse to be persuaded and will not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, even though he summon him a first and a second time, let such an one be wholly deposed and have no further remedy, neither be capable of regaining his rank. And if he persist in troubling and disturbing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, let him be corrected, as a seditious person, by the civil power.</p>

<h3>Canon 6</h3>

<p>If any one has been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, let him not be received by others until he has either been restored by his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or until, when a synod is held, he shall have appeared and made his defence, and, having convinced the synod, shall have received a different sentence. And let this decree apply to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and all who are enrolled in the clergy-list.</p>

<h3>Canon 7</h3>

<p>No stranger shall be received without letters pacifical.</p>

<h3>Canon 8</h3>

<p>Let not country <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> give letters canonical, or let them send such letters only to the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a> of good report may give letters pacifical.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>These <q>letters canonical</q> were called in the West letters <q>format&aelig;,</q> and no greater <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the great influence they had in the early days of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in binding the faithful together can be found than the fact that <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a> made an attempt to introduce something similar among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> of his empire.</p>

<p><q>Commendatory letters</q> (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76;</span>) are spoken of by St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in <a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse1">2 Cor. iii. 1</a>, and the reader will find some interesting remarks on this and cognate subjects in J. J. Blunt's, <em>The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Church during the first three Centuries</em> (Chapter II).</p>

<p>By means of these letters even the lay people found hospitality and care in every part of the world, and it was thrown up against the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> as a mark of their being schismatics that their canonical letters were good only among themselves.</p>

<p>Pseudo-Isidore informs us that it was stated at the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> by Atticus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople, that it was agreed at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> that all such letters should be marked <span class="greek">&#x03A0;. &#x03A5;. &#x0391;. &#x03A0;</span> . (i.e. Father, Son, <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>), and it is asserted (Herzog, <em>Real-Encyk., s.v.</em> Liter&aelig; Format&aelig;) that this form is found in German documents of the sixth century.</p>

<p>As will be seen among the Canons of Chalcedon, the old name, Letters Commendatory, is continued, but in this canon and in the 41st of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> the expression <q>Canonical Letters</q> is used. In the West, at least, these letters received the episcopal seal of the diocese to avoid all possibility of imposture. Dean Plumptre (whom I am following very closely in this note) believes the earliest evidence of this use of the diocesan seal is in Augustine (<em>Epist</em>. lix. <em>al</em>. ccxvij.) He also refers to Ducange, <em>s.v.</em> Format&aelig;.</p>

<p>As these letters admitted their bearers to communion they were sometimes called <q>Communion letters</q> (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76;</span>), and are so described by St. Cyril of Alexandria; and by the Council of Elvira (canon xxv.), and by St. Augustine (<em>Epist</em>. xliii. <em>al</em>. clxii).</p>

<p>The <q>Letters Pacifical</q> appear to have been of an eleemosynary character, so that the bearers of them obtained bodily help. Chalcedon in its eleventh canon ordains these <q>Letters pacifical</q> shall be given to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, whether they be <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laics</a>.

<h3>Canon 9</h3>

<p>It behooves the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in every province to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who presides in the metropolis, and who has to take thought for the whole province; because all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of business come together from every quarter to the metropolis. Wherefore it is decreed that he have precedence in rank, and that the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> do nothing extraordinary without him, (according to the ancient canon which prevailed from [the times of] our Fathers) or such things only as pertain to their own particular parishes and the districts subject to them. For each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has authority over his own parish, both to manage it with the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> which is incumbent on every one, and to make provision for the whole district which is dependent on his city; to ordain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>; and to settle everything with judgment. But let him undertake nothing further without the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the metropolis; neither the latter without the consent of the others.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">By the <q>ancient canon</q> of which mention is here made, there can scarcely be a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is intended the xxxiv. of the Canons of the Apostles, since in it are read the same provisions (and almost in the same words) as here are set forth somewhat more at length; nor is there any other canon in which these provisions are found earlier in date than this synod, wherefore from this is deduced a strong argument for the integrity of the Canons of the Apostles.</span> </p>

<p>Compare Apostolic Canon XXXIV.</p>

<h3>Canon 10</h3>

<p>The Holy Synod decrees that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in villages and districts, or those who are called <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a>, even though they may have received ordination to the Episcopate, shall regard their own limits and manage the churches subject to them, and be content with the care and administration of these; but they may ordain readers, <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacons</a> and exorcists, and shall be content with promoting these, but shall not presume to ordain either a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, without the consent of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city to which he and his district are subject. And if he shall dare to transgress [these] decrees, he shall be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> from the rank which he enjoys. And a <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a> is to be appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city to which he is subject.</p>

<h3>Canon 11</h3>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or any one whatever of the canon shall presume to betake himself to the Emperor without the consent and letters of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the province, and particularly of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the metropolis, such a one shall be publicly deposed and cast out, not only from communion, but also from the rank which he happens to have; inasmuch as he dares to trouble the ears of our Emperor beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, contrary to the law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But, if necessary business shall require any one to go to the Emperor, let him do it with the advice and consent of the metropolitan and other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the province, and let him undertake his journey with letters from them.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">This canon is one of those magnificent efforts which the early church made to check the already growing inclination to what we have in later times learned to call Erastianism. Not only did the State, as soon as it became <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, interfere in spiritual matters at its own motion, but there were found <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and others of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who not being able to attain their ends otherwise, appealed to the civil power, usually to the Emperor himself, and thus the whole discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was threatened, and the authority of spiritual synods set aside. How unsuccessful the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> often was in this struggle is only too evident from the remarks of the Greek commentator Balsamon on this very canon.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 12</h3>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> deposed by his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> deposed by a synod, shall dare to trouble the ears of the Emperor, when it is his duty to submit his case to a greater synod of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and to refer to more <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the things which he thinks right, and to abide by the examination and decision made by them; if, despising these, he shall trouble the Emperor, he shall be entitled to no pardon, neither shall he have an opportunity of defence, nor any hope of future restoration.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">It is usually supposed that this canon, as well as the fourth, and the fourteenth and fifteenth, was directed against St. Athanasius, and it was used against St. Chrysostom by his enemies. <em>Vide</em> Socrates, <em>Ecclesiastical History</em>, Book II., Chapter viij., and Sozomen's <em>Ecclesiastical History</em>, Book III., chapter v.; also <em>ibid</em>. Book VII., chapter xx.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 13</h3>

<p>No <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall presume to pass from one province to another, and ordain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to the dignity of the ministry in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not even should he have others with him, unless he should go at the written invitation of the metropolitan and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> into whose country he goes. But if he should, without invitation, proceed irregularly to the ordination of any, or to the regulation of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs which do not concern him, the things done by him are null, and he himself shall suffer the due punishment of his irregularity and his unreasonable undertaking, by being immediately deposed by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod.</p>

<h3>Canon 14</h3>

<p>If a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall be tried on any accusations, and it should then happen that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province disagree concerning him, some pronouncing the accused innocent, and others guilty; for the settlement of all disputes, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod decrees that the metropolitan call on some others belonging to the neighbouring province, who shall add their judgment and resolve the dispute, and thus, with those of the province, confirm what is determined.</p>

<h3>Canon 15</h3>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, lying under any accusation, shall be judged by all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the province, and all shall unanimously deliver the same verdict concerning him, he shall not be again judged by others, but the unanimous sentence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province shall stand firm.</p>

<h3>Canon 16</h3>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> without a see shall throw himself upon a vacant church and seize its throne, without a full synod, he shall be cast out, even if all the people over whom he has usurped jurisdiction should choose him. And that shall be [accounted] a full synod, in which the metropolitan is present.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">This, together with the following canon, was recited by Bishop Leontius in the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, from the book of the canons, in which this is called the 95th and the following the 96th, according to the order observed in that book of the canons.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 17</h3>

<p>If any one having received the ordination of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and having been appointed to preside over a people, shall not accept his ministry, and will not be persuaded to proceed to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> entrusted to him, he shall be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> until he, being constrained, accept it, or until a full synod of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province shall have determined concerning him.</p>

<h3>Canon 18</h3>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> ordained to a parish shall not proceed to the parish to which he has been ordained, not through any fault of his own, but either because of the rejection of the people, or for any other reason not arising from himself, let him enjoy his rank and ministry; only he shall not disturb the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which he joins; and he shall abide by whatever the full synod of the province shall determine, after judging the case.</p>

<h3>Canon 19</h3>

<p>A <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a></span> shall not be ordained without a synod and the presence of the metropolitan of the province. And when he is present, it is by all means better that all his brethren in the ministry of the Province should assemble together with him; and these the metropolitan ought to invite by letter. And it were better that all should meet; but if this be difficult, it is indispensable that a majority should either be present or take part by letter in the election, and that thus the appointment should be made in the presence, or with the consent, of the majority; but if it should be done contrary to these decrees, the ordination shall be of no force. And if the appointment shall be made according to the prescribed canon, and any should object through natural <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of contradiction, the decision of the majority shall prevail.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">The method of choosing a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is laid down in the canons of Nice, number iv., but the present canon adds the provision that an election which takes place in violation of the provisions of this decree is null and invalid: and that when those who are electing are divided in opinion as to whom to choose, the votes of the majority shall prevail. But when you hear this canon saying that there should be no election without the presence of the Metropolitan, you must not say that he ought to be present at an election (for this was prohibited, as is found written in other canons) but rather say that his presence here is a permission or persuasion, without which no election could take place.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 20</h3>

<p>With a view to the good of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the settlement of disputes, it is decreed to be well that synods of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, (of which the metropolitan shall give notice to the provincials), should be held in every province twice a year, one after the third week of the feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, so that the synod may be ended in the fourth week of the Pentecost; and the second on the ides of October which is the tenth [or fifteenth] day of the month Hyperberet&aelig;us; so that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and all who think themselves <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> dealt with, may resort to these synods and obtain the judgment of the synod. But it shall be unlawful for any to hold synods by themselves without those who are entrusted with the Metropolitan Sees.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">The time fixed by the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> before Lent for the meeting of the synod was not received in the East, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> kept on in the old custom of celebrating the council in the fourth week after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, for the time before Lent often presented the greatest difficulties for those in the far separated cities to come to the provincial metropolis.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 21</h3>

<p>A <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a></span> may not be translated from one parish to another, either intruding himself of his own suggestion, or under compulsion by the people, or by constraint of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; but he shall remain in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to which he was allotted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the beginning, and shall not be translated from it, according to the decree formerly passed on the subject.</p>

<h3>Canon 22</h3>

<p>Let not a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> go to a strange city, which is not subject to himself, nor into a district which does not belong to him, either to ordain any one, or to appoint <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> to places within the jurisdiction of another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, unless with the consent of the proper <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the place. And if any one shall presume to do any such thing, the ordination shall be void, and he himself shall be punished by the synod.</p>

<h3>Canon 23</h3>

<p>It shall not be lawful for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, even at the close of life, to appoint another as successor to himself; and if any such thing should be done, the appointment shall be void. But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> law must be observed, that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must not be appointed otherwise than by a synod and with the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who have the authority to promote the man who is worthy, after the falling asleep of him who has ceased from his labours.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Nothing could be more important than the provision of this canon. It is evidently intended to prevent nepotism in every form, and to leave the appointment to the vacant see absolutely to the free choice of the Metropolitan and his synod. The history of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and its present practice, is a curious commentary upon the ancient legislation, and the appointment of coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <em>cum jure successionis</em>, so common in later days, seems to be a somewhat ingenious way of escaping the force of the canon. <a href="../cathen/05541b.htm">Van Espen</a>, however, reminds his readers of the most interesting case of St. Augustine of Hippo (which he himself narrates in his Epistle CCXIII.) of how he was chosen by his predecessor as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Hippo, both he and the then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the fact that it was prohibited by the canons. And how when in his old age the people wished him to have one chosen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to help him till his death and to succeed him afterwards, he declined saying: <q>What was worthy of blame in my own case, shall not be a blot likewise upon my son.</q> He did not hesitate to say who he thought most worthy to succeed him, but he added, <q>he shall be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, as he is, and when God so wills he shall be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</q> <a href="../cathen/05541b.htm">Van Espen</a> adds; <q>All this should be read carefully that thence may be learned how St. Augustine set an example to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and pastors of taking all the pains possible that after their deaths <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> pastors, and not thieves and wolves, should enter into their flocks, who in a short time would destroy all they had accomplished by so much labour in so long a time.</q> (Cf. Eusebius. <em>H. E.</em>, Lib. VI., cap. xj. and cap. xxxij.)</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 24</h3>

<p>It is right that what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be preserved with all care to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, with a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the inspector and judge of all. And these things ought to be administered under the judgment and authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who is entrusted with the whole people and with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the congregation. But it should be manifest what is church property, with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> about him; so that these may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> assuredly what things belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that nothing be concealed from them, in order that, when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may happen to depart this life, the property belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> being well known, may not be embezzled nor lost, and in order that the private property of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may not be disturbed on a pretence that it is part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> goods. For it is just and well-pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man that the private property of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be bequeathed to whomsoever he will, but that for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be kept whatever belongs to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; so that neither the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may suffer loss, nor the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be injured under pretext of the Church's interest, nor those who belong to him fall into lawsuits, and himself, after his death, be brought under reproach.</p>

<h3>Canon 25</h3>

<p>Let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> have power over the funds of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so as to dispense them with all <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God to all who need. And if there be occasion, let him take what he requires for his own necessary uses and those of his brethren sojourning with him, so that they may in no way lack, according to the divine Apostle, who says, <q>Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content.</q> And if he shall not be content with these, but shall apply the funds to his own private uses, and not manage the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or the rent of the farms, with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, but shall give the authority to his own domestics and kinsmen, or brothers, or sons, so that the accounts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are secretly injured, he himself shall submit to an investigation by the synod of the province. But if, on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> shall be defamed as appropriating to themselves what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, (whether from lands or any other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> resources), so that the poor are oppressed, and accusation and <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> are brought upon the account and on those who so administer it, let them also be subject to correction, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod determining what is right.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">At the end of this canon in Labbe's version of Dionysius we find these words added. <q>And thirty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> signed who were gathered together at this Synod.</q> Isidore Mercator has a still fuller text, viz.: <q>I, Eusebius, being present subscribe to all things constituted by this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod. Theodore, Nicetas, Macedonius, Anatolius, Tarcodimantus, &AElig;thereus, Narcissus, Eustachius, Hesychius, Mauricius, Paulus, and the rest, thirty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> agreed and signed.</q> <a href="../cathen/05541b.htm">Van Espen</a> after noting that this addition is not found in the Greek, nor in Martin Bracarensis, adds <q>there is little probability that this clause is of the same antiquity as the canons.</q> </span> </p>
