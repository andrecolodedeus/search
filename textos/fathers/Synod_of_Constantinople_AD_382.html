<h1>Synod of Constantinople (A.D. 382)</h1>

<h2>The Synodical Letter</h2> 

<p>To the right <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> lords our right reverend brethren and colleagues, Damasus, Ambrosius, Britton, Valerianus, Ascholius, Anemius, Basilius and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled in the great city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled at the great city of Constantinople sends greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>To recount all the sufferings inflicted on us by the power of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, and to attempt to give information to your reverences, as though you were not already well acquainted with them, might seem superfluous. For we do not suppose your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to hold what is befalling us as of such secondary importance as that you stand in any need of information on matters which cannot but evoke your sympathy. Nor indeed were the storms which beset us such as to escape notice from their insignificance. Our <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> are but of yesterday. The sound of them still rings in the ears alike of those who suffered them and of those whose <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> made the sufferers' pain their own. It was but a day or two ago, so to speak, that some released from chains in foreign lands returned to their own churches through manifold afflictions; of others who had died in exile the relics were brought home; others again, even after their return from exile, found the passion of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> still at the boiling heat, and, slain by them with stones as was the blessed Stephen, met with a sadder <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> in their own than in a stranger's land. Others, worn away with various cruelties, still bear in their bodies the scars of their wounds and the marks of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Who could tell the tale of fines, of disfranchisements, of individual confiscations, of intrigues, of outrages, of prisons? In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> all kinds of tribulation were wrought out beyond number in us, perhaps because we were paying the penalty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, perhaps because the merciful God was trying us by means of the multitude of our sufferings. For these all thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who by means of such afflictions trained his servants and, according to the multitude of his mercies, brought us again to refreshment. We indeed needed long leisure, time, and toil to restore the church once more, that so, like physicians healing the body after long sickness and expelling its disease by gradual treatment, we might bring her back to her ancient health of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that on the whole we seem to have been delivered from the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of our <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> and to be just now recovering the churches which have for a long time been the prey of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. But wolves are troublesome to us who, though they have been driven from the fold, yet harry the flock up and down the glades, daring to hold rival assemblies, stirring seditious among the people, and shrinking from nothing which can do damage to the churches. So, as we have already said, we needs must labour all the longer. Since, however, you showed your brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to us by inviting us (as though we were your own members) by the letters of our most religious emperor to the synod which you are gathering by divine permission at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to the end that since we alone were then condemned to suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, you should not now, when our emperors are at one with us as to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, reign apart from us, but that we, to use the Apostle's phrase, should reign with you, our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was, if it were possible, all in company to leave our churches, and rather gratify our longing to see you than consult their needs. For who will give us wings as of a dove, and we will fly and be at rest? But this course seemed likely to leave the churches who were just recovering quite undefended, and the undertaking was to most of us impossible, for, in accordance witch the letters sent a year ago from your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> after the synod at Aquileia to the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor Theodosius, we had journeyed to Constantinople, equipped only for travelling so far as Constantinople, and bringing the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> remaining in the provinces of this synod alone. We had been in no expectation of any longer journey nor had heard a word about it, before our arrival at Constantinople. In addition to all this, and on account of the narrow limits of the appointed time which allowed of no preparation for a longer journey, nor of communicating with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of our communion in the provinces and of obtaining their consent, the journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was for the majority impossible. We have therefore adopted the next best course open to us under the circumstances, both for the better administration of the church, and for manifesting our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards you, by strongly urging our most venerated, and honoured colleagues and brother <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Cyriacus, Eusebius and Priscianus, to consent to travel to you.</p>

<p>Through them we wish to make it plain that our disposition is all for peace with unity for its sole object, and that we are full of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>. For we, whether we suffered <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, or afflictions, or the threats of emperors, or the cruelties of princes, or any other trial at the hands of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, have undergone all for the sake of the evangelic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, ratified by the three hundred and eighteen fathers at Nic&aelig;a in Bithynia. This is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which ought to be sufficient for you, for us, for all who wrest not the word of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for it is the ancient <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; it is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; it is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that teaches us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. According to this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> there is one Godhead, Power and Substance of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; the dignity being equal, and the majesty being equal in three perfect hypostases, i.e. three perfect <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Thus there is no room for the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Sabellius by the confusion of the hypostases, i.e. the destruction of the personalities; thus the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the Eunomians, of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Pneumatomachi</a> is nullified, which divides the substance, the nature, and the godhead, and super-induces on the uncreated consubstantial and co-eternal Trinity a nature posterior, created and of a different substance. We moreover preserve unperverted the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Lord, holding the tradition that the dispensation of the flesh is neither soulless nor mindless nor imperfect; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> full well that God's Word was perfect before the ages, and became perfect man in the last days for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>Let this suffice for a summary of the doctrine which is fearlessly and frankly preached by us, and concerning which you will be able to be still further satisfied if you will deign to read the tome of the synod of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and also that tome issued last year by the Ecumenical Council held at Constantinople, in which we have set forth our confession of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at greater length, and have appended an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which innovators have recently inscribed.</p>

<p>Now as to the particular administration of individual churches, an ancient custom, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, has obtained, confirmed by the enactment of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers of Nic&aelig;a, that in every province, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province, and, with their consent, the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> with them, should perform ordinations as expediency may require. In conforming with these customs note that other churches have been administered by us and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the most famous churches publicly appointed. Accordingly over the new made (if the expression be allowable) church at Constantinople, which, as through from a lion's mouth, we have lately snatched by God's mercy from the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, we have ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the right reverend and most religious Nectarius, in the presence of the Ecumenical Council, with common consent, before the most religious emperor Theodosius, and with the assent of all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and of the whole city. And over the most ancient and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> apostolic church in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, where first the noble name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was given them, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province and of the eastern diocese have met together and canonically ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the right reverend and most religious Flavianus, with the consent of all the church, who as though with one voice joined in expressing their respect for him. This rightful ordination also received the sanction of the General Council. Of the church at Jerusalem, mother of all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, we make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that the right reverend and most religious Cyril is <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who was some time ago canonically ordained by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province, and has in several places fought a good fight against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. We beseech your reverence to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at what has thus been rightly and canonically settled by us, by the intervention of spiritual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and by the influence of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, compelling the feelings of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and making the edification of churches of more importance than individual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or favour. Thus since among us there is agreement in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity has been established, we shall cease to use the phrase condemned by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, I am of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and I of Apollos and I of Cephas, and all appearing as Christ's, who in us is not divided, by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we will keep the body of the church unrent, and will boldly stand at the judgment seat of the Lord.</p>
