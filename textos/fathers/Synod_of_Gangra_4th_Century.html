<h1>Synod of Gangra (4th Century)</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>With regard to the Synod of Gangra we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> little beside what we learn from its own synodal letter. Three great questions naturally arise with regard to it.</p>

<p>1. What was its date?</p>

<p>2. Who was the Eustathius it condemned?</p>

<p>3. Who was its presiding officer?</p>

<p>I shall briefly give the reader the salient points with regard to each of these matters.</p>

<p>1. With regard to the date, there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it was after Nice and before the First Council of Constantinople, that is between 325 and 381. Socrates  seems to place it about 365; but Sozomen  some twenty years earlier. On the other hand, Remi Ceillier  inconsistently with his other statements, seems to argue from St. Basil's letters that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> date is later than 376. Still another theory has been urged by the Ballerini, resting on the supposition that the Eusebius who presided was Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea, and they therefore fix the date between 362 and 370. With this Mr. Ffoulkes agrees, and fixes the date,  with Pagi, at 358, and is bold enough to add, <q>and this was unquestionably the year of the Council.</q> But in the old collections of canons almost without exception, the canons of Gangra precede those of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and Blondel and Tillemont  have sustained this, which perhaps I may call the traditional date.</p>

<p>2. There does not seem to be any reasonable ground to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the person condemned, Eustathius by name, was the famous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Sebaste. This may be gathered from both Sozomen  and Socrates,  and is confirmed incidentally by one of St. Basil's epistles.  Moreover, Eustathius's See of Sebaste is in Armenia, and it is to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Armenia that the Synod addresses its letter. It would seem in view of all this that Bp. <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele's</a> words are not too severe when he writes, <q>Under such circumstances the statement of <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, Du Pin, and others (supported by no single ancient testimony) that another Eustathius, or possibly the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Eutactus, is here meant, deserves no serious consideration, though Tillemont did not express himself as opposed to it.</q> </p>

<p>The story that after his condemnation by the Synod of Gangra Eustathius gave up wearing his peculiar garb and other eccentricities, Sozomen only gives as a report. </p>

<p>3. As to who was the president, it seems tolerably certain that his name was Eusebius&mdash; if Sozomen  indeed means it was <q>Eusebius of Constantinople,</q> it is a blunder, yet he had the name right. In the heading of the Synodal letter Eusebius is first named, and as Gangra and Armenia were within the jurisdiction of C&aelig;sarea, it certainly would seem natural to suppose that the Eusebius named was the Metropolitan of that province, but it must be remembered that Eusebius of Cappadocia was not made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> until 362, four years after Mr. Ffoulkes makes him preside at Gangra. The names of thirteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are given in the Greek text.</p>

<p>The Latin translations add other names, such as that of <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius of Cordova</a>, and some Latin writers have asserted that he presided as legate <em>&agrave; latere</em> from the pope, <em>e.g.</em>, <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>  and Binius.  <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a> denies this and says: <q>At the time of the Synod of Gangra Hosius was without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> dead.</q>  But such has not been the opinion of the learned, and Cave  is of opinion that Hosius's <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> covered seventy years ending with 361, and (resting on the same opinion) Pagi thinks Hosius may have attended the Synod in 358 on his way back to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, an opinion with which, as I have said, Mr. Ffoulkes agrees. It seems also clear that by the beginning of the sixth century the Synod of Gangra was looked upon at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as having been held under papal authority; Pope Symmachus expressly saying so to the Roman Synod of 504. (<em>Vide</em> Notes on Canons vij. and viij.)</p>

<p>It remains only further to remark that the <em>Libellus Synodicus</em> mentions a certain Dius as president of the Synod. The Ballarini  suggest that it should be <span class="greek">&#x0392;&#x1F77;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>, an abbreviation of Eusebius. Mr. Ffoulkes suggests that Dius is <q>probably Dianius, the predecessor of Eusebius.</q> Lightfoot  fixes the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of Eusebius Pamphili as between 313 and 337; and states that that of Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia did not begin until 362, so that the enormous chronological difficulties will be evident to the reader.</p>

<p>As all the proposed new dates involve more or less contradiction, I have given the canons their usual position between Neoc&aelig;sarea and <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and have left the date undetermined.</p>

<h2>Synodical Letter</h2>

<p>Eusebius, &AElig;lian, Eugenius, Olympius, Bithynicus, Gregory, Philetus, Pappus, Eulalius, Hypatius, Pro&aelig;resius, Basil and Bassus,  assembled in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod at Gangra, to our most honoured lords and fellow-ministers in Armenia wish health in the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Forasmuch</span> as the most Holy Synod of Bishops, assembled on account of certain necessary matters of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> business in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at Gangra, on inquiring also into the matters which concern Eustathius, found that many things had been unlawfully done by these very men who are partisans of Eustathius, it was compelled to make definitions, which it has hastened to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all, for the removal of whatever has by him been done amiss. For, from their utter abhorrence of marriage, and from their adoption of the proposition that no one living in a state of marriage has any hope towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, many misguided married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> have forsaken their husbands, and husbands their wives: then, afterwards, not being able to contain, they have fallen into <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; and so, through such a principle as this, have come to shame. They were found, moreover, fomenting separations from the houses of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; treating the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and its members with disdain, and establishing separate meetings and assemblies, and different doctrines and other things in opposition to the Churches and those things which are done in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; wearing strange apparel, to the destruction of the common custom of dress; making distributions, among themselves and their adherents as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which have, from the first, been given to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; slaves also leaving their masters, and, on account of their own strange apparel, acting insolently towards their masters; <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, too, disregarding decent custom, and, instead of womanly apparel, wearing men's clothes, thinking to be justified because of these; while many of them, under a pretext of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, cut off the growth of hair, which is natural to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; [and these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were found] <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> on the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Lord's Day</a>, despising the sacredness of that free day, but disdaining and eating on the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> appointed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and certain of them abhor the eating of flesh; neither do they tolerate <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the houses of married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but, on the contrary, despise such <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> when they are made, and often refuse to partake when Oblations are offered in the houses of married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; contemning married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and refusing to touch their ministrations; condemning the services in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Martyrs  and those who gather or minister therein, and the rich also who do not alienate all their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, as having nothing to hope from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and many other things that no one could recount. For every one of them, when he forsook the canon of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, adopted <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that tended as it were to isolation; for neither was there any common judgment among all of them; but whatever any one conceived, that he propounded, to the scandal of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to his own destruction.</p>

<p>Wherefore, the Holy Synod present in Gangra was compelled, on these accounts, to condemn them, and to set forth definitions declaring them to be cast out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but that, if they should repent and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> every one of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a>, then they should be capable of restoration. And therefore the Holy Synod has particularly set forth everything which they ought to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> before they are received. And if any one will not submit to the said decrees, he shall be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, and cast out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and it will behoove the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to observe a like rule in respect of all who may be found with them.</p>

<h2>Canons</h2>

<h3>Canon 1</h3>

<p>If any one shall condemn marriage, or abominate and condemn a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is a believer and devout, and sleeps with her own husband, as though she could not enter the Kingdom [of heaven] let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 2</h3>

<p>If any one shall condemn him who eats flesh, which is without blood and has not been offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> nor strangled, and is faithful and devout, as though the man were without hope [of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>] because of his eating, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 3</h3>

<p>If any one shall teach a slave, under pretext of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, to despise his master and to run away from his service, and not to serve his own master with good-will and all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">This canon is framed in accordance with the doctrine of the Apostle, in <a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:1</a>. <q>Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, that the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his doctrine be not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>.</q> And again the same Apostle teaches his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> Titus that he should <q>exhort servants to be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again; not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/tit002.htm#verse9">Titus 2:9-10</a></span> These texts are likewise cited by Balsamon and <a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a>.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 4</h3>

<p>If any one shall maintain, concerning a married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, that is not lawful to partake of the oblation when he offers it, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 5</h3>

<p>If any one shall teach that the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the assemblies held therein are to be despised, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 6</h3>

<p>If any one shall hold private assemblies outside of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and, despising the canons, shall presume to perform <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> acts, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> refusing his permission, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Both these canons, [V. and VI.] forbid the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of conventicles, and conventicle services. It already appears from the second article of the Synodal Letter of Gangra, that the Eustathians, through spiritual <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, separated themselves from the rest of the congregation, as being the pure and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, avoided the public worship, and held private services of their own. The ninth, tenth, and eleventh articles of the Synodal Letter give us to understand that the Eustathians especially avoided the public services, when married <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> officiated. We might possibly conclude, from the words of the sixth canon: <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x1F74; &#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2; &#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B2;&#x03C5;&#x03C4;&#x1F73;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C5; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x1F70; &#x03B3;&#x03BD;&#x1F7D;&#x03BC;&#x03B7;&#x03BD; &#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x1F79;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;</span>, that no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> performed any part in their private services; but it is more probable that the Eustathians, who did not reject the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> as such, but only abhorred the married <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, had their own unmarried <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and that these officiated at their separate services. And the above-mentioned words of the canon do not the least contradict this supposition, for the very addition of the words <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x1F70; &#x03B3;&#x03BD;&#x1F7D;&#x03BC;&#x03B7;&#x03BD; &#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x1F79;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;</span> indicate that the sectarian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who performed the services of the Eustathians had received no permission to do so from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the place. Thus did the Greek commentators, Balsamon, etc., and likewise <a href="../cathen/05541b.htm">Van Espen</a>, interpret this canon.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 7</h3>

<p>If any one shall presume to take the fruits offered to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or to give them out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or of the person charged with such things, and shall refuse to act according to his judgment, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 8</h3>

<p>If anyone, except the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or the person appointed for the stewardship of benefactions, shall either give or receive the revenue, let both the giver and the receiver be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 9</h3>

<p>If any one shall remain virgin, or observe continence, abstaining from marriage because he abhors it, and not on account of the beauty and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> itself, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a> writes: Virginity is most beautiful of all, and continence is likewise beautiful, but only if we follow  them for their own sake and because of the sanctification which comes from them. But should anyone embrace <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, because he detests marriage as impure, and keep himself chaste, and abstains from commerce with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and marriage, because he thinks that they are in themselves <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, he is subjected by this canon to the penalty of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p>This canon is found in the <em>Corpus Juris Canonici</em>, Gratian's <em>Decretum</em>, Pars I., Dist. xxx., c. v., and again Dist. xxxi., c. ix.</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 10</h3>

<p>If any one of those who are living a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> life for the Lord's sake shall treat arrogantly the married, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 11</h3>

<p>If anyone shall despise those who out of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> make <a href="../cathen/01200b.htm">love-feasts</a> and invite the brethren in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Lord, and is not willing to accept these invitations because he despises what is done, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 12</h3>

<p>If any one, under pretence of <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a>, should wear a <em>peribol&aelig;um</em> and, as if this gave him righteousness, shall despise those who with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> wear the <em>berus</em> and use other common and customary dress, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">The <span class="greek">&#x03B2;&#x1F75;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;</span> (<em>lacern&aelig;</em>) were the common upper garments worn by men over the tunic; but the <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03B2;&#x1F79;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span> were rough mantles worn by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> to show their contempt for all luxury. Socrates (<em>H. E.</em>, ii. 43) and the Synodal Letter of Gangra in its third article say that Eustathius of Sebaste wore the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher's</a> mantle. But this canon in no way absolutely rejects a special dress for <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, for it is not the distinctive dress but the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and superstitious over-estimation of its worth which the Synod here blames.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 13</h3>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, under pretence of <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a>, shall change her apparel and, instead of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> accustomed clothing, shall put on that of a man, let her be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">The synodal letter in its sixth article also speaks of this. Exchange of dress, or the adoption by one sex of the dress of the other, was forbidden in the Pentateuch <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 22:5</a></span>, and was therefore most strictly interdicted by the whole ancient Church. Such change of attire was formerly adopted mainly for theatrical purposes, or from effeminacy, wantonness, the furtherance of unchastity, or the like. The Eustathians, from quite opposite and hyper-ascetical reasons, had recommended <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to assume male, that is probably <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk's</a> attire, in order to show that for them, as the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ones, there was no longer any distinction of sex; but the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, also from ascetical reasons, forbade this change of attire, especially when joined to <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> and puritanical <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 14</h3>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall forsake her husband, and resolve to depart from him because she abhors marriage, let her be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki"> <a href="../cathen/05541b.htm">Van Espen</a>: It would seem that the Eustathians chiefly disapproved of the use of marriage, and under pretext of preserving continence induced married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to abstain from its use as from something unlawful, and to leave their husbands, separating from them so far as the bed was concerned; and so the Greek interpreters understand this canon; for the Eustathians were never accused of persuading anyone to dissolve a marriage <em>a vinculo</em>. </span> </p>

<h3>Canon 15</h3>

<p>If anyone shall forsake his own children and shall not nurture them, nor so far as in him lies, rear them in becoming <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, but shall neglect them, under pretence of <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">The fathers of this Synod here teach that it is the office and duty of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to provide for the bodily care of their children, and also, as far as in them lies, to mould them to the practice of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. And this care for their children is to be preferred by <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to any private exercises of religion. In this connection should be read the letter of St. Francis de Sales. (<em>Ep</em>. xxxii, Lib. 4.)</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 16</h3>

<p>If, under any pretence of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, any children shall forsake their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, particularly [if the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> are] <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and shall withhold becoming reverence from their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, on the plea that they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> more than them, let them be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki"><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a> notes that the use of the word <q>particularly</q> shows that the obligation is universal. The commentators all refer here to <a href="../bible/mat015.htm">St. Matthew xv.</a>, where our Lord speaks of the subterfuge by which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> under pretext of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> defrauded their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and made the law of God of none effect.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 17</h3>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from pretended <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a> shall cut off her hair, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave her as the reminder of her subjection, thus annulling as it were the ordinance of subjection, let her be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 11:10</a>, represents the long hair of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, which is given them as a natural veil, as a token of their subjection to man. We learn from the Synod of Gangra, that as many Eustathian <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> renounced this subjection, and left their husbands, so, as this canon says, they also did away with their long hair, which was the outward token of this subjection. An old proverb says: <em>duo si faciunt idem, non est idem</em>. In the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> also, when <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and girls enter the cloister, they have their hair cut off, but from quite other reasons than those of the Eustathian <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The former give up their hair, because it has gradually become the custom to consider the long hair of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as a special beauty, as their greatest ornament; but the Eustathians, like the ancient Church in general, regarded long hair as the token of subjection to the husband, and, because they renounced marriage and forsook their husbands, they cut it off.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 18</h3>

<p>If any one, under pretence of <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a>, shall fast on Sunday, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Eustathius appointed the Lord's day as a fast, whereas, because Christ rose from the grave and delivered <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on that day, we should spend it in offering joyous thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> carries with it the idea of grief and sorrow. For this reason those who fast on Sunday are subjected to the punishment of <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 19</h3>

<p>If any of the <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetics</a>, without bodily necessity, shall behave with insolence and disregard the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> commonly prescribed and observed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, because of his perfect understanding in the matter, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 20</h3>

<p>If any one shall, from a presumptuous disposition, condemn and abhor the assemblies [in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>] of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, or the services performed there, and the commemoration of them, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</p>

<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p>These things we write, not to cut off those who wish to lead in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> an <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> life, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; but those who carry the pretence of <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a> to superciliousness; both exalting themselves above those who live more simply, and introducing novelties contrary to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Canons. We do, assuredly, admire <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> accompanied by humility; and we have regard for continence, accompanied by godliness and gravity; and we praise the leaving of worldly occupations, [when it is made] with lowliness of mind; [but at the same time] we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> companionship of marriage, and we do not contemn <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> enjoyed with uprightness and beneficence; and we commend plainness and frugality in apparel, [which is worn] only from attention, [and that] not over-fastidious, to the body; but dissolute and effeminate excess in dress we eschew; and we reverence the houses of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and embrace the assemblies held therein as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and helpful, not confining religion within the houses, but reverencing every place built in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and we approve of gathering together in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself for the common profit; and we bless the exceeding charities done by the brethren to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, according to the traditions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and, to sum up in a word, we wish that all things which have been delivered by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> and the Apostolical traditions, may be observed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">This epilogue is lacking in the ancient epitome; and while it occurs after Canon XX. in the versions of Dionysius Exiguus and of Isidore Mercator, it is not numbered as a canon. Moreover in John of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch's</a> <em>Collection</em> and in Photius's <em>Nomocanon</em>, the number of canons is said to be 20. Only the Greek Scholiasts number it as Canon XXI., but its genuineness is unquestioned.</span> </p>
