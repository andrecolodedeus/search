<h1>Synod of Laodicea (4th Century)</h1>

<h2>Historical Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> at which the Synod met is <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> in Phrygia Pacatiana, also called <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> ad Lycum, and to be carefully distinguished from the <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. This much is certain, but as to the exact date of the Synod there is much discussion. Peter de Marca fixed it at the year 365, but Pagi in his <em>Critica</em> on <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius's</a> <em>Annals</em>  seems to have overthrown the arguments upon which de Marca rested, and agrees with Gothofred in placing it <em>circa</em> 363. At first sight it would seem that the Seventh Canon gave a clue which would settle the date, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinians</a> are mentioned, and Bishop Photinus began to be prominent in the middle of the fourth century and was <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> by the Eusebians in a synod at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in 344, and by the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> at Milan in 345; and finally, after several other condemnations, he died in banishment in 366. But it is not quite certain whether the word <q><a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinians</a></q> is not an interpolation. Something with regard to the date may perhaps be drawn from the word <span class="greek">&#x03A0;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2;</span> as descriptive of Phrygia, for it is probable that this division was not yet made at the time of the Sardican Council in 343. <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a> concludes that <q>Under such circumstances, it is best, with Remi Ceillier, Tillemont, and others, to place the meeting of the synod of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> generally somewhere between the years 343 and 381, i.e., between the Sardican and the Second Ecumenical Council&mdash; and to give up the attempt to discover a more exact date.</q> </p>

<p>But since the traditional position of the canons of this Council is after those of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and immediately before those of First Constantinople, I have followed this order. Such is their position in <q>very many old collections of the Councils which have had their origin since the sixth or even in the fifth century,</q> says <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that Matthew Blastares places these canons after those of Sardica, but the Quinisext Synod in its Second Canon and Pope Leo IV., according to the <em>Corpus Juris Canonici</em>,  give them the position which they hold in this volume.</p>

<h2>The Canons</h2>

<p><strong>The Canons of the Synod Held in the City of Laodicea, in Phrygia Pacatiana, in which Many Blessed Fathers from Divers Provinces of Asia Were Gathered Together. </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod which assembled at <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> in Phrygia Pacatiana, from various regions of Asia; set forth the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> definitions which are hereunder annexed.</p>

<h3>Canon 1</h3>

<p>It is right, according to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Canon, that the Communion should by indulgence be given to those who have freely and lawfully joined in second marriages, not having previously made a secret marriage; after a short space, which is to be spent by them in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 2</h3>

<p>They who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in various particulars, if they have persevered in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of confession and penance, and are wholly converted from their faults, shall be received again to communion, through the mercy and goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, after a time of penance appointed to them, in proportion to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of their offense.</p>

<h3>Canon 3</h3>

<p>He who has been <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">recently baptized</a> ought not to be promoted to the sacerdotal order.</p>

<h3>Canon 4</h3>

<p>They who are of the sacerdotal order ought not to lend and receive <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, nor what is called hemioli&aelig;.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Dionysius Exiguus and Isidore have numbered this canon v., and our fifth they have as iv.</span> </p>

<h3>Canon 5</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Ordinations</span> are not to be held in the presence of hearers.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>Balsamon: "This canon calls elections <q><a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a>,</q> and says that since in elections unworthy  things are often said with regard to those who are elected, therefore they should not take place in the presence of any that might happen to come to hear."</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a> also agrees that election is here intended, but Aristenus dissents and makes the reference to ordinations properly so-called, as follows: The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of ordination are not to be said out loud so that they may be heard by the people.</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 6</h3>

<p>It is not permitted to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to enter the house of God while they continue in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 7</h3>

<p>Persons converted from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, that is, of the Novatians, <a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinians</a>, and Quartodecimans, whether they were <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> or communicants among them, shall not be received until they shall have <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and particularly that in which they were held; and afterwards those who among them were called communicants, having thoroughly learned the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and having been anointed with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> chrism, shall so communicate in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Mysteries.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>I have allowed the word <q><a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinians</a></q> to stand in the text although whether it is not an interpolation is by no means certain. They certainly were <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> on the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, and therefore differed from the other dissidents mentioned in the canon, all of whom were <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> on this matter. It is also worthy of note that the word is not found in Ferrandus's Condensation (<em>Breviatio Canonum</em>, n. 177) nor in Isidore's version. Moreover there is a Latin codex in Lucca, and also one in Paris (as is noted by Mansi, v. 585; ij. 591) in which it is lacking. It was rejected by <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, Binius, and Remi Ceillier.</p>

<p>The word <q>Catechumens</q> is wanting in many Greek mss. but found in Balsamon, moreover, Dionysius and Isidore had it in their texts.</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 8</h3>

<p>Persons converted from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of those who are called <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Phrygians</a>, even should they be among those reputed by them as clergymen, and even should they be called the very chiefest, are with all care to be both instructed and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p><a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>: "This synod here declares the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> invalid, while in the preceding canon it recognised as valid the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the Novatians and Quartodecimans. From this, it would appear that the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> were suspected of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> with regard to the doctrine of the Trinity. Some other authorities of the ancient Church, however, judged differently, and for a long time it was a question in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> whether to consider the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> valid or not. Dionysius the Great of Alexandria was in favour of its validity: but this Synod and the Second General Council rejected it as invalid, not to mention the Synod of Iconium (235), which declared all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> invalid. This uncertainty of the ancient Church is accounted for thus: (a) On one side the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>, and especially <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, asserted that they held the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, especially the same <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (<em>eadem lavacri sacramenta</em>) as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. St. Epiphanius concurred in this, and testified that the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> taught the same regarding the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as did the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. (b) Other Fathers, however, thought less favourably of them, and for this reason, that the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> often expressed themselves so ambiguously, that they might, nay, must be said completely to identify the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> with <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> in quoting expressions of <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>, actually says: <q>the Paraclete speaks</q>; and therefore Firmilian, Cyril of Jerusalem, Basil the Great, and other Fathers, did in fact, reproach the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> with this identification, and consequently held their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to be invalid. (c) Basil the Great goes to the greatest length in this direction in maintaining that the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> and Priscilla. But it is very probable, as Tillemont conjectured, that Basil only founded these strange stories of their manner of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> upon his assumption that they identified <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; and, as <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> maintains, it is equally <q>probable that the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> did not alter the form of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. But, even admitting all this, their ambiguous expressions concerning <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> would alone have rendered it advisable to declare their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> invalid.</q> (d) Besides this, a considerable number of <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>, namely, the school of &AElig;schines, fell into Sabellianism, and thus their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was decidedly invalid. (<em>Vide</em> Article in Wetzer and Welte <em>Kirchenlexicon s.v.</em> <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>; by myself [i.e. <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>])."</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 9</h3>

<p>The members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are not allowed to meet in the cemeteries, nor attend the so-called martyries of any of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> or service; but such as so do, if they be communicants, shall be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for a time; but if they repent and confess that they have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> they shall be received.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Balsamon: "As canon vi. forbids <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to enter the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so this canon forbids the faithful to go to the cemeteries of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, which are called by them <q>Martyries.</q>...For in the days of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, certain of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, calling themselves <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, suffered even to death, and hence those who shared their opinions called them <q><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>.</q>" </span> </p>

<h3>Canon 10</h3>

<p>The members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> shall not indiscriminately marry their children to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 11</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Presbytides</span>, as they are called, or female presidents, are not to be appointed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>Balsamon:

<p>In old days certain venerable <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B2;&#x1F7B;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x03B5;&#x03C2;</span>) sat in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches, and took care that the other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> kept good and modest order. But from their habit of using improperly that which was proper, either through their arrogancy or through their base self-seeking, scandal arose. Therefore the Fathers prohibited the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> thereafter of any more such <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as are called presbytides or presidents. And that no one may object that in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> must preside over the rest, it should be remembered that the renunciation which they make of themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> brings it to pass that they are thought of as one body though many; and all things which are theirs, relate only to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to teach in a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, where a multitude of men is gathered together, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of different opinions, is, in the highest degree, indecorous and pernicious.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>:</p>

<p>It is doubtful what was here intended, and this canon has received very different interpretations. In the first place, what is the meaning of the words <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B2;&#x1F7B;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x03B5;&#x03C2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x1F75;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span> (<q>presbytides</q> and female presidents)? I think the first light is thrown on the subject by Epiphanius, who in his treatise against the Collyridians (<em>H&aelig;r</em>., lxxix. 4) says that <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> had never been allowed to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, as the Collyridians presumed to do, but were only allowed to minister. Therefore there were only <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and even if the oldest among them were called &#8216;presbytides,' this term must be clearly distinguished from presbyteresses. The latter would mean priestesses (<span class="greek">&#x1F31;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03C3;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>), but &#8216;presbytides' only designated their age, as seniors.</q> According to this, the canon appears to treat of the superior <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a> who were the overseers (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x1F75;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) of the other <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>; and the further words of the text may then probably mean that in future no more such superior <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a> or eldresses were to be appointed, probably because they had often outstepped their authority.</p>

<p>Neander, Fuchs, and others, however, think it more probable that the terms in question are in this canon to be taken as simply meaning <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, for even in the church they had been wont to preside over the female portion of the congregation (whence their name of <q>presidents</q>); and, according to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> rule, only <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> over sixty years of age were to be chosen for this office (hence called <q>presbytides</q>). We may add, that this direction of the apostle was not very strictly adhered to subsequently, but still it was repeatedly enjoined that only elder <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should be chosen as <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>. Thus, for instance, the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, in its fifteenth canon, required that <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a> should be at least forty years of age, while the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> even prescribed the age of sixty.</p>

<p>Supposing now that this canon simply treats of <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, a fresh <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> arises as to how the last words&mdash; <q>they are not to be appointed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a></q> are to be understood. For it may mean that <q>from henceforth no more <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a> shall be appointed;</q> or, that <q>in future they shall no more be solemnly ordained in the church.</q> The first interpretation would, however, contradict the fact that the Greek Church had <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a> long after the Synod of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>. For instance, in 692 the Synod <em>in Trullo</em> (Can. xiv.) ordered that <q>no one under forty years of age should be ordained <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a>.</q> Consequently the second interpretation, <q>they shall not be solemnly ordained in the church,</q> seems a better one, and Neander decidedly prefers it. It is certainly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that several later synods distinctly forbade the old practice of conferring a sort of ordination upon <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, as, for instance, the first Synod of Orange (<em>Arausicanum I.</em> of 441, Can. xxvj.) in the words&mdash; <em>diacon&aelig; omnimodis non ordinand&aelig;</em>; also the Synod at Epaon in 517 (Can. xxj.), and the second Synod at Orleans in 533 (Can. xviij.); but in the Greek Church at least, an ordination, a <span class="greek">&#x03C7;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03C3;&#x03B8;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>, took place as late as the Council <em>in Trullo</em> (Can. xiv.). But this Canon of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> does not speak of solemn dedication, and certainly not of ordination, but only of <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x1F77;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03B8;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span> . These reasons induce us to return to the first interpretation of this canon, and to understand it as forbidding from that time forward the appointment of any more chief <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a> or <q>presbytides.</q></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a> and Balsamon give yet another explanation. In their opinion, these <q>presbytides</q> were not chief <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, but aged <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in general (<em>ex populo</em>), to whom was given the supervision of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>, in church. The Synod of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>, however, did away with this arrangement, probably because they had misused their office for purposes of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, or money-making, <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribery</a>, etc.</p>

<h3>Canon 15</h3>

<p>No others shall sing in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, save only the canonical singers, who go up into the <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a> and sing from a book.</p>

<h3>Canon 16</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> are to be read on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> [i.e. Saturday], with the other Scriptures.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>Before the arrangement of the Ecclesiastical Psalmody was settled, neither the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> nor the other Scriptures were accustomed to be read on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. But out of regard to the canons which forbade <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> or kneeling on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, there were no services, so that there might be as much feasting as possible. This the fathers prohibit, and decree that on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office shall be said.</p>

<p>Neander (<em>Kirchengesch</em>., 2d ed., vol. iij., p. 565 <em>et seq</em>.) suggests in addition to the interpretation just given another, viz.: that it was the custom in many parts of the ancient Church to keep every Saturday as a feast in commemoration of the Creation. Neander also suggests that possibly some Judaizers read on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> only the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>; he, however, himself remarks that in this case <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03B1;&#x03B3;&#x03B3;&#x1F73;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1F11;&#x03C4;&#x1F73;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;&#x03BD; &#x03B3;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03C6;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;</span> would require the article.</p>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/05541b.htm">Van Espen</a>.</span> </p>

<p>Among the Greeks the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> was kept exactly as the Lord's day except so far as the cessation of work was concerned, wherefore the Council wishes that, as on Sundays, after the other lessons there should follow the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<p>For it is evident that by the intention of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the whole Divine Office was designed for the edification and instruction of the people, and especially was this the case on feast days, when the people were apt to be present in large numbers.</p>

<p>Here we may note the origin of our present [Western] discipline, by which on Sundays and feast days the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is wont to be read with the other Scriptures in the canonical hours, while such is not the case on ferial days, or in the order for ferias and <q>simples.</q> </p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 17</h3>

<p>The Psalms are not to be joined together in the congregations, but a lesson shall intervene after every psalm.</p>

<h3>Canon 18</h3>

<p>The same <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">service of prayers</a> is to be said always both at nones and at vespers.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>: "Some feasts ended at the ninth hour, others only in the evening, and both alike with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The Synod here wills that in both cases the same <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> should be used. Thus does <a href="../cathen/05541b.htm">Van Espen</a> explain the words of the text, and I think rightly. But the Greek commentator understands the Synod to order that the same <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> should be used in all places, thus excluding all individual caprice. According to this, the rule of conformity would refer to places; while, according to <a href="../cathen/05541b.htm">Van Espen</a>, the nones and vespers were to be the same. If, however, this interpretation were correct, the Synod would not have only spoken of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> at nones and vespers, but would have said in general, <q>all <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> shall use the same form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</q>"</p>

<h3>Canon 19</h3>

<p>After the sermons of the Bishops, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> is to be made first by itself; and after the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> have gone out, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for those who are under penance; and, after these have passed under the hand [of the Bishop] and departed, there should then be offered the three <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the faithful, the first to be said entirely in silence, the second and third aloud, and then the [<a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of] peace is to be given. And, after the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> have given the [<a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of] peace to the Bishop, then the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> are to give it [to one another], and so the Holy Oblation is to be completed. And it is lawful to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> alone to go to the Altar and [there] communicate.</p>

<h3>Canon 20</h3>

<p>It is not right for a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> to sit in the presence of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, unless he be bidden by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> to sit down. Likewise the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> shall have worship of the subdeacons and all the [inferior] <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 21</h3>

<p>The subdeacons have no right to a place in the Diaconicum, nor to touch the Lord's <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">vessels</a>.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki"><a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>: It is doubtful whether by <em>diaconicum</em> is here meant the place where the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> stood during service, or the <em>diaconicum</em> generally so called, which answers to our sacristy of the present day. In this <em>diaconicum</em> the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> and vestments were kept; and as the last part of the canon especially mentions these, I have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <em>diaconicum</em> must mean the sacristy. For the rest, this canon is only the concrete expression of the rule, that the subdeacons shall not assume the functions of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. </span> </p>

<h3>Canon 22</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> has no right to wear an <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">orarium</a>, nor to leave the doors.</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">In old times, so we are told by <a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a> and Balsamon, it was the place of the subdeacons to stand at the church doors and to bring in and take out the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and the penitents at the proper points in the service. <a href="../cathen/15764a.htm">Zonaras</a> remarks that no one need be surprised if this, like many other ancient customs, has been entirely changed and abandoned.</span> </p>

After this, having acquired some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, they were admitted to the public instructions given by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in church; and were therefore called <em>Audientes</em> and for the first time properly-speaking <em>Catechumens</em>. But when these <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> had been kept in this rank a sufficient time and had been there tried, they were allowed to go up to the higher grade called <em>Genuflectentes</em>.</p>

<p>And when their exercises had been completed in this order they were brought by the catechists who had had the charge of them, to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, that on the Holy <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> [<a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Even] they might receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> gave their names at the same time, so that they might be set down for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> at the coming Holy <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover we learn from St. Augustine (Serm. xiii., Ad Neophitos,) that the time for the giving in of the names was the beginning of Lent.</p>

<p>This council therefore in this canon decrees that such as do not hand in their names at the beginning of Lent, but after two weeks are past, shall not be admitted to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> on the next Holy <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 46</h3>

<p>They who are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> must learn the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> [Creed] by heart, and recite it to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, on the fifth day of the week.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>.</span> </p>

<p>It is doubtful whether by the Thursday of the text was meant only the Thursday of Holy Week, or every Thursday of the time during which the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> received instruction. The Greek commentators are in favour of the latter, but Dionysius Exiguus and Isidore, and after them Bingham, are, and probably rightly, in favour of the former meaning. This canon was repeated by the Trullan Synod in its seventy-eighth canon.</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 47</h3>

<p>They who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in sickness and afterwards recover, must learn the Creed by heart and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Divine gifts have been vouchsafed them.</p>

<h3>Canon 48</h3>

<p>They who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> must after Baptism be <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">anointed with the heavenly chrism</a>, and be partakers of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 49</h3>

<p>During Lent the Bread must not be offered except on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> Day and on the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Lord's Day</a> only.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>.</span> </p>

<p>This canon, which was repeated by the Trullan Synod in its fifty-second canon, orders that on ordinary week days during Lent, only a <em>Missa Pr&aelig;sanctificatorum</em> should take place, as is still the custom with the Greeks on all days of penitence and mourning, when it appears to them unsuitable to have the full liturgy, and as Leo Allatius says, for this reason, that the consecration is a joyful act. A comparison of the above sixteenth canon, however, shows that Saturday was a special exception.</p>

<p>To the Saturdays and Sundays mentioned by <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a> must be added the feast of the Annunciation, which is always solemnized with a full celebration of the Liturgy, even when it falls upon Good Friday.</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 50</h3>

<p>The fast must not be broken on the fifth day of the last week in Lent [i.e., on Maunday Thursday], and the whole of Lent be dishonoured; but it is necessary to fast during all the Lenten season by eating only dry meats.</p>

<h3>Canon 51</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10709a.htm">nativities</a> of Martyrs are not to be celebrated in Lent, but commemorations of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Martyrs are to be made on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a> and Lord's days.</p>

<h3>Canon 52</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Marriages</span> and birthday feasts are not to be celebrated in Lent.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>.</span> </p>

<p>By <q>birthday feasts</q> in this canon the <em>natalitia martyrum</em> is not to be understood as in the preceding canon, but the birthday feasts of princes. This, as well as the preceding rule, was renewed in the sixth century by Bishop Martin of Bracara, now Braga, in Portugal.</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 53</h3>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a></span>, when they attend weddings, must not join in wanton dances, but modestly dine or breakfast, as is becoming to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 54</h3>

<p>Members of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> must not <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> the plays at weddings or banquets; but, before the players enter, they must rise and depart.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>Aristenus.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are admonished to feast modestly when they go to weddings and not to dance nor <span class="greek">&#x03B2;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x03BB;&#x1F77;&#x03B6;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>, that is to clap their hands and make a noise with them. For this is unworthy of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> standing. But <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> must not see the play at weddings, but before the <em>thymelici</em> begin, they must go out.</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 55</h3>

<p>Neither members of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> nor of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, nor yet <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, may club together for drinking entertainments.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>These meals, the expenses of which were defrayed by a number clubbing together and sharing the cost, were called <q>symbola</q> by Isidore, and by Melinus and Crabbe <q>comissalia,</q> although the more ordinary form is <q>commensalia</q> or <q>comessalia.</q> <em>Cf</em>. Ducange <em>Gloss</em>., <em>s.v.</em> Commensalia <em>and</em> Confertum.</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 56</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a> may not enter and take their seats in the bema before the entrance of the Bishop: but they must enter with the Bishop, unless he be at home sick, or absent.</p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>It is difficult to translate this canon without giving a false idea of its meaning. It does not determine the order of dignity in an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> procession, but something entirely different, viz., it provides that when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> enters the sanctuary he should not be alone and walk into a place already occupied, but that he should have with him, as a guard of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Whether these should walk before or after him would be a mere matter of local custom, the rule <em>juniores priores</em> did not universally prevail.</p>
</div>

<h3>Canon 57</h3>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">Bishops</a></span> must not be appointed in villages or country districts, but visitors; and those who have been already appointed must do nothing without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city. <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a>, in like manner, must do nothing without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 58</h3>

<p>The Oblation must not be made by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> in any private houses.</p>

<h3>Canon 59</h3>

<p>No psalms composed by private individuals nor any uncanonical books may be read in the church, but only the Canonical Books of the Old and New Testaments.</p>

<h3>Canon 60</h3>

<p>[<em>N. B.&mdash; This Canon is of most questionable genuineness</em>.]</p>
