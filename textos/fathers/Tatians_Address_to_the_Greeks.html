<h1><a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>'s Address to the Greeks</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. The Greeks Claim, Without Reason, the Invention of the Arts</h2>

<p>Be not, O Greeks, so very hostilely disposed towards the Barbarians, nor look with ill will on their opinions. For which of your institutions has not been derived from the Barbarians? The most eminent of the Telmessians invented the art of divining by dreams; the Carians, that of prognosticating by the stars; the Phrygians and the most ancient Isaurians, augury by the flight of birds; the Cyprians, the art of inspecting victims. To the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a> you owe astronomy; to the Persians, magic; to the Egyptians, geometry; to the Ph&oelig;nicians, instruction by alphabetic writing. Cease, then, to miscall these imitations inventions of your own. Orpheus, again, taught you poetry and song; from him, too, you learned the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. The Tuscans taught you the plastic art; from the annals of the Egyptians you learned to write history; you acquired the art of playing the flute from Marsyas and Olympus,&mdash; these two rustic Phrygians constructed the harmony of the shepherd's pipe. The Tyrrhenians invented the trumpet; the Cyclopes, the smith's art; and a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was formerly a queen of the Persians, as Hellanicus tells us, the method of joining together epistolary tablets:  her name was Atossa. Wherefore lay aside this conceit, and be not ever boasting of your elegance of diction; for, while you applaud yourselves, your own people will of course side with you. But it becomes a man of sense to wait for the testimony of others, and it becomes men to be of one accord also in the pronunciation of their language. But, as matters stand, to you alone it has happened not to speak alike even in common intercourse; for the way of speaking among the Dorians is not the same as that of the inhabitants of Attica, nor do the &AElig;olians speak like the Ionians. And, since such a discrepancy exists where it ought not to be, I am at a loss whom to call a Greek. And, what is strangest of all, you hold in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> expressions not of native growth, and by the intermixture of barbaric words have made your language a medley. On this account we have renounced your wisdom, though I was once a great proficient in it; for, as the comic poet  says&mdash;</p> <blockquote><p>These are gleaners' grapes and small talk&mdash;<br>Twittering places of swallows, corrupters of art.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet those who eagerly pursue it shout lustily, and croak like so many ravens. You have, too, contrived the art of rhetoric to serve <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a>, selling the free power of your speech for hire, and often representing the same thing at one time as right, at another time as not good. The poetic art, again, you employ to describe battles, and the amours of the gods, and the corruption of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. The Vices and Errors of the Philosophers</h2>

<p>What noble thing have you produced by your pursuit of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>? Who of your most eminent men has been free from vain boasting? Diogenes, who made such a parade of his independence with his tub, was seized with a bowel complaint through eating a raw polypus, and so lost his life by <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>. Aristippus, walking about in a purple robe, led a profligate life, in accordance with his professed opinions. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, was sold by Dionysius for his gormandizing propensities. And Aristotle, who absurdly placed a limit to Providence and made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to consist in the things which give pleasure, quite contrary to his duty as a preceptor flattered Alexander, forgetful that he was but a youth; and he, showing how well he had learned the lessons of his master, because his friend would not worship him shut him up and and carried him about like a bear or a leopard. He in fact <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> strictly the precepts of his teacher in displaying manliness and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> by feasting, and transfixing with his spear his intimate and most beloved friend, and then, under a semblance of grief, weeping and starving himself, that he might not incur the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of his friends. I could laugh at those also who in the present day adhere to his tenets&mdash;people who say that sublunary things are not under the care of Providence; and so, being nearer the earth than the moon, and below its orbit, they themselves look after what is thus left uncared for; and as for those who have neither beauty, nor <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, nor bodily strength, nor high birth, they have no <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, according to Aristotle. Let such men philosophize, for me!</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Ridicule of the Philosophers</h2>

<p>I cannot approve of Heraclitus, who, being self-taught and arrogant, said, <q>I have explored myself.</q> Nor can I praise him for hiding his poem  in the temple of Artemis, in order that it might be published afterwards as a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>; and those who take an interest in such things say that Euripides the tragic poet came there and read it, and, gradually learning it by heart, carefully handed down to posterity this darkness  of Heraclitus. Death, however, demonstrated the stupidity of this man; for, being attacked by dropsy, as he had studied the art of medicine as well as <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, he plastered himself with cow-dung, which, as it hardened, contracted the flesh of his whole body, so that he was pulled in pieces, and thus died. Then, one cannot listen to Zeno, who declares that at the conflagration the same man will rise again to perform the same actions as before; for instance, Anytus and Miletus to accuse, Busiris to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> his guests, and Hercules to repeat his labours; and in this doctrine of the conflagration he introduces more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> than just <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>&mdash; one Socrates and a Hercules, and a few more of the same class, but not many, for the bad will be found far more numerous than the good. And according to him the Deity will manifestly be the author of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, dwelling in sewers and worms, and in the perpetrators of impiety. The eruptions of fire in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, moreover, confute the empty boasting of Empedocles, in that, though he was no god, he <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> almost gave himself out for one. I laugh, too, at the old wife's talk of Pherecydes, and the doctrine inherited from him by Pythagoras, and that of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, an imitation of his, though some think otherwise. And who would give his approval to the cynogamy of Crates, and not rather, repudiating the wild and tumid speech of those who resemble him, turn to the investigation of what <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> deserves attention? Wherefore be not led away by the solemn assemblies of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who are no <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who dogmatize one against the other, though each one vents but the crude fancies of the moment. They have, moreover, many collisions among themselves; each one <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the other; they indulge in conflicting opinions, and their arrogance makes them eager for the highest places. It would better become them, moreover, not to pay court to kings unbidden, nor to flatter men at the head of affairs, but to wait till the great ones come to them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. The Christians Worship God Alone</h2>

<p>For what reason, men of Greece, do you wish to bring the civil powers, as in a pugilistic encounter, into collision with us? And, if I am not disposed to comply with the usages of some of them, why am I to be abhorred as a vile miscreant?  Does the sovereign order the payment of tribute, I am ready to render it. Does my master command me to act as a bondsman and to serve, I acknowledge the serfdom. Man is to be honoured as a fellow-man;  God alone is to be feared,&mdash; He who is not visible to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> eyes, nor comes within the compass of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> art. Only when I am commanded to deny Him, will I not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, but will rather die than show myself false and ungrateful. Our God did not begin to be in time:  He alone is without beginning, and He Himself is the beginning of all things. God is a Spirit, <span class="stiki" id="note020429"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;4:24</a></span> not pervading matter, but the Maker of material spirits,  and of the forms that are in matter; He is invisible, impalpable, being Himself the Father of both sensible and invisible things. Him we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from His creation, and apprehend His invisible power by His works. <span class="stiki" id="note020431"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;1:20</a></span> I refuse to adore that workmanship which He has made for our sakes. The sun and moon were made for us: how, then, can I adore my own servants? How can I speak of stocks and stones as gods? For the Spirit that pervades matter  is inferior to the more divine spirit; and this, even when assimilated to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is not to be honoured equally with the perfect God. Nor even ought the ineffable God to be presented with gifts; for He who is in want of nothing is not to be misrepresented by us as though He were indigent. But I will set forth our views more distinctly.</p> 

<h2>Chapter 5. The Doctrine of the Christians as to the Creation of the World</h2>

<p>God was in the beginning; but the beginning, we have been taught, is the power of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>. For the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, who is Himself the necessary ground (<span class="greek">&#x1F51;&#x03C0;&#x1F79;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>) of all being, inasmuch as no creature was yet in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, was alone; but inasmuch as He was all power, Himself the necessary ground of things visible and invisible, with Him were all things; with Him, by Logos-power (<span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x1F70; &#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B3;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x03B4;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x1F71;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;</span>), the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> Himself also, who was in Him, subsists.  And by His simple will the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> springs forth; and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, not coming forth in vain, becomes the first-begotten work of the Father. Him (the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>) we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be the beginning of the world. But He came into being by participation,  not by abscission; for what is cut off is separated from the original substance, but that which comes by participation, making its choice of function,  does not render him deficient from whom it is taken. For just as from one torch many fires are lighted, but the light of the first torch is not lessened by the kindling of many torches, so the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, coming forth from the Logos-power of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, has not divested of the Logos-power Him who begot Him. I myself, for instance, talk, and you hear; yet, certainly, I who converse do not become destitute of speech (<span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x1F79;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) by the transmission of speech, but by the utterance of my voice I endeavour to reduce to order the unarranged matter in your minds. And as the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>,  begotten in the beginning, begot in turn our world, having first created for Himself the necessary matter, so also I, in imitation of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, being begotten again,  and having become possessed of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, am trying to reduce to order the confused matter which is kindred with myself. For matter is not, like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without beginning, nor, as having no beginning, is of equal power with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; it is begotten, and not produced by any other being, but brought into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by the Framer of all things alone.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Christians' Belief in the Resurrection</h2>

<p>And on this account we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there will be a resurrection of bodies after the consummation of all things; not, as the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> affirm, according to the return of certain cycles, the same things being produced and destroyed for no useful purpose, but a resurrection once for all,  when our periods of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> are completed, and in consequence solely of the constitution of things under which men alone live, for the purpose of passing judgment upon them. Nor is sentence upon us passed by Minos or Rhadamanthus, before whose decease not a single <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according to the mythic tales, was judged; but the Creator, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, becomes the arbiter. And, although you regard us as mere triflers and babblers, it troubles us not, since we have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in this doctrine. For just as, not existing before I was born, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not who I was, and only <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the potentiality (<span class="greek">&#x1F50;&#x03C0;&#x1F79;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>) of fleshly matter, but being born, after a former state of nothingness, I have obtained through my birth a certainty of my <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; in the same way, having been born, and through death existing no longer, and seen no longer, I shall exist again, just as before I was not, but was afterwards born. Even though fire destroy all traces of my flesh, the world receives the vaporized matter;  and though dispersed through rivers and seas, or torn in pieces by wild beasts, I am laid up in the storehouses of a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> Lord. And, although the poor and the godless <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what is stored up, yet God the Sovereign, when He pleases, will restore the substance that is visible to Him alone to its pristine condition.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Concerning the Fall of Man</h2>

<p>For the heavenly <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, a spirit emanating from the Father and a <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> from the Logos-power, in imitation of the Father who begot Him made man an image of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, so that, as incorruption is with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in like manner, man, sharing in a part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, might have the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> principle also. The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>,  too, before the creation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, was the Framer of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. And each of these two orders of creatures was made free to act as it pleased, not having the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of good, which again is with God alone, but is brought to perfection in men through their freedom of choice, in order that the bad man may be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> punished, having become depraved through his own fault, but the just man be deservedly praised for his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, since in the exercise of his free choice he refrained from transgressing the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Such is the constitution of things in reference to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men. And the power of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, having in itself a faculty to foresee future events, not as fated, but as taking place by the choice of free agents, foretold from time to time the issues of things to come; it also became a forbidder of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> by means of prohibitions, and the encomiast of those who remained good. And, when men attached themselves to one who was more subtle than the rest, having regard to his being the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>,  and declared him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though he was resisting the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then the power of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> excluded the beginner of the folly and his adherents from all fellowship with Himself. And so he who was made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since the more powerful spirit is separated from him, becomes mortal; but that first-begotten one through his transgression and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> becomes a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>; and they who imitated him, that is his illusions, have become a host of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and through their freedom of choice have been given up to their own infatuation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. The Demons Sin Among Mankind</h2>

<p>But men form the material (<span class="greek">&#x1F51;&#x03C0;&#x1F79;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>) of their <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>. For, having shown them a plan of the position of the stars, like dice-players, they introduced Fate, a flagrant <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. For the judge and the judged are made so by Fate; the murderers and the murdered, the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> and the needy, are the offspring of the same Fate; and every nativity is regarded as a theatrical entertainment by those beings of whom Homer says&mdash;</p> <blockquote><p><q>Among the gods <br>Rose laughter irrepressible.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>But must not those who are spectators of single combats and are partisans on one side or the other, and he who marries and is a pederast and an adulterer, who laughs and is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, who flees and is wounded, be regarded as mortals? For, by whatever actions they manifest to men their characters, by these they prompt their hearers to copy their example. And are not the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> themselves, with Zeus at their head, subjected to Fate, being overpowered by the same <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> as men? And, besides, how are those beings to be worshipped among whom there exists such a great contrariety of opinions? For Rhea, whom the inhabitants of the Phrygian mountains call Cybele, enacted emasculation on account of Attis, of whom she was enamoured; but Aphrodit&eacute; is delighted with conjugal embraces. Artemis is a poisoner; Apollo heals diseases. And after the decapitation of the Gorgon, the beloved of Poseidon, whence sprang the horse Pegasus and Chrysaor, Athen&eacute; and Asclepios divided between them the drops of blood; and, while he saved men's lives by means of them, she, by the same blood, became a homicide and the instigator of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. From regard to her <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, as it appears to me, the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> attributed to the earth the son born of her connection with Heph&aelig;stos, that Athen&eacute; might not be thought to be deprived of her virility by Heph&aelig;stos, as Atalanta by Meleager. This limping manufacturer of buckles and earrings, as is likely, deceived the motherless child and orphan with these girlish ornaments. Poseidon frequents the seas; Ares delights in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>; Apollo is a player on the cithara; Dionysus is absolute sovereign of the Thebans; Kronos is a tyrannicide; Zeus has intercourse with his own daughter, who becomes pregnant by him. I may instance, too, Eleusis, and the mystic Dragon, and Orpheus, who says&mdash;</p> <blockquote><p><q>Close the gates against the profane!</q></p></blockquote>

<p>A&iuml;doneus carries off Kor&eacute;, and his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> have been made into <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>; Demeter bewails her daughter, and some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are deceived by the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>. In the precincts of the temple of the son of Leto is a spot called Omphalos; but Omphalos is the burial-place of Dionysus. You now I laud, O Daphne!&mdash; by conquering the incontinence of Apollo, you disproved his power of vaticination; for, not foreseeing what would occur to you,  he derived no advantage from his art. Let the far-shooting god tell me how Zephyrus slew Hyacinthus. Zephyrus conquered him; and in accordance with the saying of the tragic poet&mdash;</p> <blockquote><p><q>A breeze is the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> chariot of the gods,</q> &mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>conquered by a slight breeze, Apollo lost his beloved.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. They Give Rise to Superstitions</h2>

<p>Such are the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; these are they who laid down the doctrine of Fate. Their fundamental principle was the placing of animals in the heavens. For the creeping things on the earth, and those that swim in the waters, and the quadrupeds on the mountains, with which they lived when expelled from heaven,&mdash; these they dignified with celestial <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, in order that they might themselves be thought to remain in heaven, and, by placing the constellations there, might make to appear rational the irrational course of life on earth.  Thus the high-spirited and he who is crushed with toil, the temperate and the intemperate, the indigent and the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>, are what they are simply from the controllers of their nativity. For the delineation of the zodiacal circle is the work of gods. And, when the light of one of them predominates, as they express it, it deprives all the rest of their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; and he who now is conquered, at another time gains the predominance. And the seven planets are well pleased with them,  as if they were amusing themselves with dice. But we are superior to Fate, and instead of wandering (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;</span>) <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, we have learned to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> one Lord who wanders not; and, as we do not follow the guidance of Fate, we reject its lawgivers. Tell me, I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> you,  did Triptolemus sow wheat and prove a benefactor to the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> after their sorrow? And why was not Demeter, before she lost her daughter, a benefactress to men? The Dog of Erigone is shown in the heavens, and the Scorpion the helper of Artemis, and Chiron the Centaur, and the divided Argo, and the Bear of Callisto. Yet how, before these performed the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, were the heavens unadorned? And to whom will it not appear ridiculous that the Deltotum  should be placed among the stars, according to some, on account of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, or, as others say, on account of the first letter in the name of Zeus (<span class="greek">&#x0394;&#x03B9;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>)? For why are not Sardinia and <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> honoured in heaven? And why have not the letters of the names of the brothers of Zeus, who shared the kingdom with him, been fixed there too? And how is it that Kronos, who was put in chains and ejected from his kingdom, is constituted a manager  of Fate? How, too, can he give kingdoms who no longer reigns himself? Reject, then, these absurdities, and do not become transgressors by hating us <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Ridicule of the Heathen Divinities</h2>

<p>There are legends of the metamorphosis of men: with you the gods also are metamorphosed. Rhea becomes a tree; Zeus a dragon, on account of Persephone; the sisters of Pha&euml;thon are changed into poplars, and Leto into a bird of little value, on whose account what is now Delos was called Ortygia. A god, forsooth, becomes a swan, or takes the form of an eagle, and, making Ganymede his cupbearer, glories in a vile affection. How can I reverence gods who are eager for presents, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> if they do not receive them? Let them have their Fate! I am not willing to adore wandering stars. What is that hair of Berenic&eacute;? Where were her stars before her death? And how was the dead Antinous fixed as a beautiful youth in the moon? Who carried him there: unless perchance, as men, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjuring</a> themselves for hire, are credited when they say in ridicule of the gods that kings have ascended into heaven, so some one, in like manner, has put this man also among the gods,  and been recompensed with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and reward? Why have you <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> God? Why do you dishonour His workmanship? You <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> a sheep, and you adore the same animal. The Bull is in the heavens, and you slaughter its image. The Kneeler  crushes a noxious animal; and the eagle that devours the man-maker Prometheus is honoured. The swan is noble, forsooth, because it was an adulterer; and the Dioscuri, living on alternate days, the ravishers of the daughters of Leucippus, are also noble! Better still is Helen, who forsook the flaxen-haired Menelaus, and followed the turbaned and gold-adorned Paris. A just man also is Sophron,  who transported this adulteress to the Elysian fields! But even the daughter of Tyndarus is not gifted with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and Euripides has wisely represented this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> as <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by Orestes.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. The Sin of Men Due Not to Fate, But to Free-Will</h2>

<p>How, then, shall I admit this nativity according to Fate, when I see such managers of Fate? I do not wish to be a king; I am not anxious to be rich; I decline military command; I detest fornication; I am not impelled by an insatiable <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of gain to go to sea; I do not contend for chaplets; I am free from a mad thirst for fame; I despise death; I am superior to every kind of disease; grief does not consume my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Am I a slave, I endure servitude. Am I free, I do not make a boast of my good birth. I see that the same sun is for all, and one death for all, whether they live in pleasure or destitution. The rich man sows, and the poor man partakes of the same sowing. The wealthiest die, and beggars have the same limits to their life. The rich lack many things, and are <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> only through the estimation they are held in;  but the poor man and he who has very moderate desires, seeking as he does only the things suited to his lot, more easily obtains his purpose. How is it that you are fated to be sleepless through <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>? Why are you fated to grasp at things often, and often to die? Die to the world, repudiating the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> that is in it. Live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by apprehending Him lay aside your old nature.  We were not created to die, but we die by our own fault.  Our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> has destroyed us; we who were free have become slaves; we have been sold through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has been created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; we ourselves have manifested <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; but we, who have manifested it, are able again to reject it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. The Two Kinds of Spirits</h2>

<p>We recognise two varieties of spirit, one of which is called the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>  (<span class="greek">&#x03C8;&#x03C5;&#x03C7;&#x1F75;</span>), but the other is greater than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, an image and likeness of God: both <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the first men, that in one sense they might be material (<span class="greek">&#x1F51;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x1F77;</span>), and in another superior to matter. The case stands thus: we can see that the whole structure of the world, and the whole creation, has been produced from matter, and the matter itself brought into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>  by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so that on the one hand it may be regarded as rude and unformed before it was separated into parts, and on the other as arranged in beauty and order after the separation was made. Therefore in that separation the heavens were made of matter, and the stars that are in them; and the earth and all that is upon it has a similar constitution: so that there is a common origin of all things. But, while such is the case, there yet are certain differences in the things made of matter, so that one is more beautiful, and another is beautiful but surpassed by something better. For as the constitution of the body is under one management, and is engaged in doing that which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its having been made,  yet though this is the case, there are certain differences of dignity in it, and the eye is one thing, and another the ear, and another the arrangement of the hair and the distribution of the intestines, and the compacting together of the marrow and the bones and the tendons; and though one part differs from another, there is yet all the harmony of a concert of music in their arrangement&mdash;in like manner the world, according to the power of its Maker containing some things of superior splendour, but some unlike these, received by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Creator a material spirit. And these things severally it is possible for him to perceive who does not conceitedly reject those most divine explanations which in the course of time have been consigned to writing, and make those who study them great lovers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>,  as you call them, having received their structure from matter and obtained the spirit which inheres in it, became intemperate and greedy; some few, indeed, turning to what was purer, but others choosing what was inferior in matter, and conforming their manner of life to it. These beings, produced from matter, but very remote from right conduct, you, O Greeks, worship. For, being turned by their own folly to vaingloriousness, and shaking off the reins [of authority], they have been forward to become <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> of Deity; and the Lord of all has suffered them to besport themselves, till the world, coming to an end, be dissolved, and the Judge appear, and all those men who, while assailed by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, strive after the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the perfect God obtain as the result of their conflicts a more perfect testimony in the day of judgment. There is, then, a spirit in the stars, a spirit in <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, a spirit in plants and the waters, a spirit in men, a spirit in animals; but, though one and the same, it has differences in itself.  And while we say these things not from mere hearsay, nor from probable conjectures and sophistical reasoning, but using words of a certain diviner speech, do you who are willing hasten to learn. And you who do not reject with contempt the Scythian Anacharsis, do not disdain to be taught by those who follow a barbaric code of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Give at least as favourable a reception to our tenets as you would to the prognostications of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a>. Hearken to us when we speak, if only as you would to an oracular oak. And yet the things just referred to are the trickeries of frenzied <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, while the doctrines we inculcate are far beyond the apprehension of the world.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Theory of the Soul's Immortality</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not in itself <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, O Greeks, but mortal.  Yet it is possible for it not to die. If, indeed, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it dies, and is dissolved with the body, but rises again at last at the end of the world with the body, receiving death by punishment in <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. But, again, if it acquires the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it dies not, although for a time it be dissolved. In itself it is darkness, and there is nothing luminous in it. And this is the meaning of the saying, <q>The darkness comprehends not the light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note020462"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;1:5</a></span> For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not preserve the spirit, but is preserved by it, and the light comprehends the darkness. The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is the light of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is darkness. On this account, if it continues solitary, it tends downward towards matter, and dies with the flesh; but, if it enters into union with the Divine Spirit, it is no longer helpless, but ascends to the regions whither the Spirit guides it: for the dwelling-place of the spirit is above, but the origin of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is from beneath. Now, in the beginning the spirit was a constant companion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but the spirit forsook it because it was not willing to follow. Yet, retaining as it were a spark of its power, though unable by reason of the separation to discern the perfect, while seeking for God it fashioned to itself in its wandering many gods, following the sophistries of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> is not with all, but, taking up its abode with those who live <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, and intimately combining with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by prophecies it announced hidden things to other <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to wisdom have attracted to themselves the cognate spirit;  but the disobedient, rejecting the minister of the suffering <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  have shown themselves to be fighters against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, rather than His worshippers.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. The Demons Shall Be Punished More Severely Than Men</h2>

<p>And such are you also, O Greeks,&mdash; profuse in words, but with minds strangely warped; and you acknowledge the dominion of many rather than the rule of one, accustoming yourselves to follow <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> as if they were mighty. For, as the inhuman robber is wont to overpower those like himself by daring; so the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, going to great lengths in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, have utterly deceived the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> among you which are left to themselves by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and false appearances. These beings do not indeed die easily, for they do not partake of flesh; but while living they practice the ways of death, and die themselves as often as they teach their followers to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Therefore, what is now their chief distinction, that they do not die like men, they will retain when about to suffer punishment: they will not partake of everlasting life, so as to receive this instead of death in a blessed <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. And as we, to whom it now easily happens to die, afterwards receive the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> with enjoyment, or the painful with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who abuse the present life to purposes of wrong-doing, dying continually even while they live, will have hereafter the same <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, like that which they had during the time they lived, but in its nature like that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who voluntarily performed what the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> prescribed to them during their lifetime. And do not fewer kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> break out among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> owing to the brevity of their lives,  while on the part of these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> transgression is more abundant owing to their boundless <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Necessity of a Union with the Holy Spirit</h2>

<p>But further, it becomes us now to seek for what we once had, but have lost, to unite the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and to strive after union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> consists of many parts, and is not simple; it is composite, so as to manifest itself through the body; for neither could it ever appear by itself without the body, nor does the flesh rise again without the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Man is not, as the croaking <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> say, merely a rational animal, capable of understanding and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for, according to them, even irrational creatures appear possessed of understanding and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But man alone is the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and I mean by man, not one who performs actions similar to those of animals, but one who has advanced far beyond mere humanity&mdash; to God Himself. This question we have discussed more minutely in the treatise concerning animals. But the principal point to be spoken of now is, what is intended by the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. That which cannot be compared is no other than abstract being; but that which is compared is no other than that which is like. The perfect God is without flesh; but man is flesh. The bond of the flesh is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>;  that which encloses the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the flesh. Such is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> constitution; and, if it be like a temple, God is pleased to dwell in it by the spirit, His representative; but, if it be not such a habitation, man excels the wild beasts in articulate language only&mdash;in other respects his manner of life is like theirs, as one who is not a likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But none of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> possess flesh; their structure is spiritual, like that of fire or air. And only by those whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwells in and fortifies are the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> easily seen, not at all by others&mdash;I mean those who possess only <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>;  for the inferior has not the ability to apprehend the superior. On this account the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> has no place for repentance; for they are the reflection of matter and of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. But matter desired to exercise lordship over the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and according to their <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> these gave <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of death to men; but men, after the loss of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, have conquered death by submitting to death in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;  and by repentance a call has been given to them, according to the word which says, <q>Since they were made a little lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q>  And, for every one who has been conquered, it is possible again to conquer, if he rejects the condition which brings death. And what that is, may be easily seen by men who long for <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. Vain Display of Power by the Demons</h2>

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>  who rule over men are not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men; for how should these be capable of action after death? Unless man, who while living was void of understanding and power, should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> when dead to be endowed with more of active power. But neither could this be the case, as we have shown elsewhere.  And it is difficult to conceive that the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is impeded by the members of the body, should become more intelligent when it has migrated from it. For the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, inspired with frenzy against men by reason of their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, pervert their minds, which already incline downwards, by various deceptive scenic representations, that they may be disabled from rising to the path that leads to heaven. But from us the things which are in the world are not hidden, and the divine is easily apprehended by us if the power that makes <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> visits us. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are seen also by the men possessed of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when, as sometimes, they exhibit themselves to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, either that they may be thought to be something, or as evil-disposed friends may do harm to them as to enemies, or afford occasions of doing them <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to those who resemble them. For, if it were possible, they would without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> pull down heaven itself with the rest of creation. But now this they can by no means effect, for they have not the power; but they make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> by means of the lower matter against the matter that is like themselves. Should any one wish to conquer them, let him repudiate matter. Being armed with the breastplate  of the celestial Spirit, he will be able to preserve all that is encompassed by it. There are, indeed, diseases and disturbances of the matter that is in us; but, when such things happen, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> ascribe the causes of them to themselves, and approach a man whenever disease lays hold of him. Sometimes they themselves disturb the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of the body by a tempest of folly; but, being smitten by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they depart in terror, and the sick man is healed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17. They Falsely Promise Health to Their Votaries</h2>

<p>Concerning the sympathies and antipathies of Democritus what can we say but this, that, according to the common saying, the man of Abdera is Abderiloquent? But, as he who gave the name to the city, a friend of Hercules as it is said, was devoured by the horses of Diomedes, so he who boasted of the Magian Ostanes  will be delivered up in the day of consummation  as fuel for the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>. And you, if you do not cease from your laughter, will gain the same punishment as the jugglers. Wherefore, O Greeks, hearken to me, addressing you as from an eminence, nor in mockery transfer your own want of reason to the herald of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. A diseased affection (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x1F71;&#x03B8;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) is not destroyed by a counter-affection (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03C0;&#x1F71;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span>), nor is a maniac cured by hanging little amulets of leather upon him. There are visitations of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; and he who is sick, and he who says he is in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and he who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>, and he who wishes to be revenged, accept them as helpers. And this is the method of their operation: just as the forms of alphabetic letters and the lines composed of them cannot of themselves indicate what is meant, but men have invented for themselves signs of their thoughts, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> by their peculiar combination what the order of the letters was intended to express; so, in like manner, the various kinds of roots and the mutual relation of the sinews and bones can effect nothing of themselves, but are the elemental matter with which the depravity of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> works, who have determined for what purpose each of them is available. And, when they see that men consent to be served by means of such things, they take them and make them their slaves. But how can it be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> to minister to adulteries? How can it be noble to stimulate men in hating one another? Or how is it becoming to ascribe to matter the relief of the insane, and not to God? For by their art they turn men aside from the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> acknowledgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, leading them to place confidence in herbs and roots.  But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if He had prepared these things to effect just what men wish, would be a Producer of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things; whereas He Himself produced everything which has good qualities, but the profligacy of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> has made use of the productions of nature for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> purposes, and the appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which these wear is from them, and not from the perfect God. For how comes it to pass that when alive I was in no wise <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but that now I am dead and can do nothing, my remains, which are incapable of motion or even sense, should effect something cognizable by the senses? And how shall he who has died by the most miserable death be able to assist in avenging any one? If this were possible, much more might he defend himself from his own enemy; being able to assist others, much more might he constitute himself his own avenger.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. They Deceive, Instead of Healing</h2>

<p>But medicine and everything included in it is an invention of the same kind. If any one is healed by matter, through trusting to it, much more will he be healed by having recourse to the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As noxious preparations are material compounds, so are curatives of the same nature. If, however, we reject the baser matter, some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> often endeavour to heal by a union of one of these bad things with some other, and will make use of the bad to attain the good. But, just as he who dines with a robber, though he may not be a robber himself, partakes of the punishment on account of his intimacy with him, so he who is not bad but associates with the bad, having dealings with them for some supposed good, will be punished by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Judge for partnership in the same object. Why is he who trusts in the system of matter  not willing to trust in God? For what reason do you not approach the more powerful Lord, but rather seek to cure yourself, like the dog with grass, or the stag with a viper, or the hog with river-crabs, or the lion with apes? Why you deify the objects of nature? And why, when you cure your neighbour, are you called a benefactor? Yield to the power of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>! The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> do not cure, but by their art make men their captives. And the most admirable Justin  has rightly denounced them as <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>. For, as it is the practice of some to capture <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and then to restore them to their friends for a ransom, so those who are esteemed gods, invading the bodies of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and producing a sense of their presence by dreams, command them to come forth into public, and in the sight of all, when they have taken their fill of the things of this world, fly away from the sick, and, destroying the disease which they had produced, restore men to their former state.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19. Depravity Lies at the Bottom of Demon-Worship</h2>

<p>But do you, who have not the perception of these things, be instructed by us who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them: though you do profess to despise death, and to be sufficient of yourselves for everything. But this is a discipline in which your <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are so greatly deficient, that some of them receive from the king of the Romans 600 aurei yearly, for no useful service they perform, but that they may not even wear a long beard without being paid for it! Crescens, who made his nest in the great city, surpassed all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in unnatural <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>), and was strongly addicted to the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>. Yet this man, who professed to despise death, was so afraid of death, that he endeavoured to inflict on Justin, and indeed on me, the punishment of death, as being an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because by proclaiming the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> he convicted the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of being <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttons</a> and cheats. But whom of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, save you only, was he accustomed to inveigh against? If you say, in agreement with our tenets, that death is not to be dreaded, do not court death from an insane <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of fame among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, like Anaxagoras, but become despisers of death by reason of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The construction of the world is excellent, but the life men live in it is bad; and we may see those greeted with applause as in a solemn assembly who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not God. For what is <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>? And why are you deceived by it? It is a minister to you of worldly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>. You wish to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and you take Apollo as a counsellor of slaughter. You want to carry off a maiden by force, and you select a divinity to be your accomplice. You are ill by your own fault; and, as Agamemnon  wished for ten councillors, so you wish to have gods with you. Some <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> by drinking water gets into a frenzy, and loses her senses by the fumes of frankincense, and you say that she has the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Apollo was a prognosticator and a teacher of soothsayers: in the matter of Daphne he deceived himself. An oak, forsooth, is oracular, and birds utter presages! And so you are inferior to animals and plants! It would surely be a fine thing for you to become a divining rod, or to assume the wings of a bird! He who makes you fond of money also foretells your getting rich; he who excites to seditions and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> also predicts victory in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. If you are superior to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, you will despise all worldly things. Do not abhor us who have made this attainment, but, repudiating the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>,  follow the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>. <q>All things <span class="stiki" id="note020480"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> were made by Him, and without Him not one thing was made.</q> If there is poison in natural productions, this has supervened through our sinfulness. I am able to show the perfect <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of these things; only do you hearken, and he who believes will understand.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. Thanks are Ever Due to God</h2>

<p>Even if you be healed by drugs (I grant you that point by courtesy), yet it behooves you to give testimony of the cure to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the world still draws us down, and through weakness I incline towards matter. For the wings of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were the perfect spirit, but, having cast this off through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it flutters like a nestling and falls to the ground. Having left the heavenly companionship, it hankers after communion with inferior things. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> were driven forth to another abode; the first created <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings were expelled from their place: the one, indeed, were cast down from heaven; but the other were driven from earth, yet not out of this earth, but from a more excellent order of things than exists here now. And now it behooves us, yearning after that pristine state, to put aside everything that proves a hindrance. The heavens are not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, O man, but finite and bounded; and beyond them are the superior worlds which have not a change of seasons, by which various diseases are produced, but, partaking of every <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> temperature, have perpetual day, and light unapproachable by men below.  Those who have composed elaborate descriptions of the earth have given an account of its various regions so far as this was possible to man; but, being unable to speak of that which is beyond, because of the impossibility of personal observation, they have assigned as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of tides; and that one sea is filled with weed, and another with mud; and that some localities are burnt up with heat, and others cold and frozen. We, however, have learned things which were unknown to us, through the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who, being fully persuaded that the heavenly spirit  along with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will acquire a clothing of mortality, foretold things which other minds were unacquainted with. But it is possible for every one who is naked to obtain this apparel, and to return to its ancient kindred.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21. Doctrines of the Christians and Greeks Respecting God Compared</h2>

<p>We do not act as fools, O Greeks, nor utter idle tales, when we announce that God was born in the form of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. I call on you who reproach us to compare your mythical accounts with our narrations. Athen&eacute;, as they say, took the form of De&iuml;phobus for the sake of Hector,  and the unshorn Pho&oelig;bus for the sake of Admetus fed the trailing-footed oxen, and the spouse us came as an old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to Semele. But, while you treat seriously such things, how can you deride us? Your Asclepios died, and he who ravished fifty <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in one night at Thespi&aelig; lost his life by delivering himself to the devouring flame. Prometheus, fastened to Caucasus, suffered punishment for his good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> to men. According to you, Zeus is <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, and hides the dream  from men, wishing their destruction. Wherefore, looking at your own memorials, vouchsafe us your approval, though it were only as dealing in legends similar to your own. We, however, do not deal in folly, but your legends are only idle tales. If you speak of the origin of the gods, you also declare them to be mortal. For what reason is Hera now never pregnant? Has she grown old? Or is there no one to give you information? Believe me now, O Greeks, and do not resolve your myths and gods into allegory. If you attempt to do this, the divine nature as held by you is overthrown by your own selves; for, if the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> with you are such as they are said to be, they are worthless as to character; or, if regarded as <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of the powers of nature, they are not what they are called. But I cannot be persuaded to pay religious homage to the natural elements, nor can I undertake to persuade my neighbour. And Metrodorus of Lampsacus, in his treatise concerning Homer, has argued very foolishly, turning everything into allegory. For he says that neither Hera, nor Athen&eacute;, nor Zeus are what those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> suppose who consecrate to them sacred enclosures and groves, but parts of nature and certain arrangements of the elements. Hector also, and Achilles, and Agamemnon, and all the Greeks in general, and the Barbarians with Helen and Paris, being of the same nature, you will of course say are introduced merely for the sake of the machinery  of the poem, not one of these personages having really <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. But these things we have put forth only for argument's sake; for it is not allowable even to compare our notion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with those who are wallowing in matter and mud.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22. Ridicule of the Solemnities of the Greeks</h2>

<p>And of what sort are your teachings? Who must not treat with contempt your solemn festivals, which, being held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, cover men with <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>? I have often seen a man &mdash; and have been amazed to see, and the amazement has ended in contempt, to think how he is one thing internally, but outwardly counterfeits what he is not&mdash; giving himself excessive airs of daintiness and indulging in all sorts of effeminacy; sometimes darting his eyes about; sometimes throwing his hands hither and there, and raving with his face smeared with mud; sometimes personating Aphrodit&eacute;, sometimes Apollo; a solitary accuser of all the gods, an epitome of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, a vituperator of heroic <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, an actor of murders, a chronicler of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, a storehouse of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, a teacher of cyn&aelig;di, an instigator of capital sentences;&mdash; and yet such a man is praised by all. But I have rejected all his falsehoods, his impiety, his practices&mdash;in short, the man altogether. But you are led captive by such men, while you revile those who do not take a part in your pursuits. I have no mind to stand agape at a number of singers, nor do I desire to be affected in sympathy with a man when he is winking and gesticulating in an unnatural manner. What wonderful or extraordinary thing is performed among you? They utter ribaldry in affected tones, and go through indecent movements; your daughters and your sons behold them giving lessons in <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> on the stage. Admirable places, forsooth, are your lecture-rooms, where every base action perpetrated by night is proclaimed aloud, and the hearers are regaled with the utterance of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> discourses! Admirable, too, are your mendacious poets, who by their fictions beguile their hearers from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>!</p>

<h2>Chapter 23. Of the Pugilists and Gladiators</h2>

<p>I have seen men weighed down by bodily exercise, and carrying about the burden of their flesh, before whom rewards and chaplets are set, while the adjudicators cheer them on, not to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but to rivalry in <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and discord; and he who excels in giving blows is crowned. These are the lesser <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; as for the greater, who would not shrink from telling them? Some, giving themselves up to idleness for the sake of profligacy, sell themselves to be killed; and the indigent barters himself away, while the rich man buys others to kill him. And for these the witnesses take their seats, and the boxers meet in single combat, for no reason whatever, nor does any one come down into the arena to succour. Do such exhibitions as these redound to your credit? He who is chief among you collects a legion of blood-stained murderers, engaging to maintain them; and these ruffians are sent forth by him, and you assemble at the spectacle to be judges, partly of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the adjudicator, and partly of that of the men who engage in the combat. And he who misses the murderous exhibition is grieved, because he was not doomed to be a spectator of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and impious and abominable <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. You slaughter animals for the purpose of eating their flesh, and you purchase men to supply a cannibal banquet for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, nourishing it by the most impious bloodshedding. The robber commits <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> for the sake of plunder, but the rich man purchases gladiators for the sake of their being killed. </p>

<h2>Chapter 24. Of the Other Public Amusements</h2>

<p>What advantage should I gain from him who is brought on the stage by Euripides raving mad, and acting the matricide of Alcm&aelig;on; who does not even retain his natural behaviour, but with his mouth wide open goes about sword in hand, and, screaming aloud, is burned to death, habited in a robe unfit for man? Away, too, with the mythical tales of Acusilaus, and Menander, a versifier of the same class! And why should I admire the mythic piper? Why should I busy myself about the Theban Antigenides,  like Aristoxenus? We leave you to these worthless things; and do you either <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> our doctrines, or, like us, give up yours.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25. Boastings and Quarrels of the Philosophers</h2>

<p>What great and wonderful things have your <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> effected? They leave uncovered one of their shoulders; they let their hair grow long; they cultivate their beards; their nails are like the claws of wild beasts. Though they say that they want nothing, yet, like Proteus,  they need a currier for their wallet, and a weaver for their mantle, and a wood-cutter for their staff, and the rich,  and a cook also for their <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>. O man competing with the dog,  you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so have turned to the imitation of an irrational animal. You cry out in public with an assumption of authority, and take upon you to avenge your own self; and if you receive nothing, you indulge in abuse, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is with you the art of getting money. You follow the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> lifts up his voice to oppose you. Again, you wish to be a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Aristotle, and a follower of Democritus rails at you. Pythagoras says that he was Euphorbus, and he is the heir of the doctrine of Pherecydes; but Aristotle impugns the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. You who receive from your predecessors doctrines which clash with one another, you the inharmonious, are fighting against the harmonious. One of you asserts that God is body, but I assert that He is without body; that the world is indestructible, but I say that it is to be destroyed; that a conflagration will take place at various times, but I say that it will come to pass once for all; that Minos and Rhadamanthus are judges, but I say that God Himself is Judge; that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone is endowed with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, but I say that the flesh also is endowed with it.  What injury do we inflict upon you, O Greeks? Why do you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> those who follow the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as if they were the vilest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>? It is not we who eat <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh &mdash; they among you who assert such a thing have been suborned as false witnesses; it is among you that Pelops is made a supper for the gods, although beloved by Poseidon, and Kronos devours his children, and Zeus swallows Metis.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26. Ridicule of the Studies of the Greeks</h2>

<p>Cease to make a parade of sayings which you have derived from others, and to deck yourselves like the daw in borrowed plumes. If each state were to take away its contribution to your speech, your fallacies would lose their power. While inquiring what God is, you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what is in yourselves; and, while staring all agape at the sky, you stumble into pitfalls. The reading of your books is like walking through a labyrinth, and their readers resemble the cask of the Dana&iuml;ds. Why do you divide time, saying that one part is past, and another present, and another future? For how can the future be passing when the present exists? As those who are sailing <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> in their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, as the ship is borne along, that the hills are in motion, so you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is you who are passing along, but that time (<span class="greek">&#x1F41; &#x03B1;&#x1F30;&#x1F7D;&#x03BD;</span>) remains present as long as the Creator wills it to exist. Why am I called to account for uttering my opinions, and why are you in such haste to put them all down? Were not you born in the same manner as ourselves, and placed under the same government of the world? Why say that wisdom is with you alone, who have not another sun, nor other risings of the stars, nor a more distinguished origin, nor a death preferable to that of other men? The grammarians have been the beginning of this idle talk; and you who parcel out wisdom are cut off from the wisdom that is according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and assign the names of the several parts to particular men; and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in your fierce contentions destroy one another. And on this account you are all nothing worth. While you arrogate to yourselves the sole right of discussion, you discourse like the blind man with the deaf. Why do you handle the builder's tools without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how to build? Why do you busy yourselves with words, while you keep aloof from <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, puffed up with praise, but cast down by misfortunes? Your modes of acting are contrary to reason, for you make a pompons appearance in public, but hide your teaching in corners. Finding you to be such men as these, we have abandoned you, and no longer concern ourselves with your tenets, but follow the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Why, O man, do you set the letters of the alphabet at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with one another? Why do you, as in a boxing match, make their sounds clash together with your mincing Attic way of speaking, whereas you ought to speak more according to nature? For if you adopt the Attic dialect though not an Athenian, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> why do you not speak like the Dorians? How is it that one appears to you more rugged, the other more pleasant for intercourse?</p>

<h2>Chapter 27. The Christians are Hated Unjustly</h2>

<p>And if you adhere to <em>their</em> teaching, why do you fight against me for choosing such views of doctrine as I approve? Is it not unreasonable that, while the robber is not to be punished for the name he bears,  but only when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about him has been clearly ascertained, yet we are to be assailed with abuse on a judgment formed without examination? Diagoras was an Athenian, but you punished him for divulging the Athenian <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>; yet you who read his Phrygian discourses <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us. You possess the commentaries of Leo, and are displeased with our refutations of them; and having in your hands the opinions of Apion concerning the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> gods, you denounce us as most impious. The tomb of Olympian Zeus is shown among you,  though some one says that the Cretans are liars.  Your assembly of many gods is nothing. Though their despiser <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> acts as a torch-bearer,  I do not any the more conceal from the rulers that view of God which I hold in relation to His government of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Why do you advise me to be false to my principles? Why do you who say that you despise death exhort us to use art in order to escape it? I have not the heart of a deer; but your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for dialectics resembles the loquacity of Thersites. How can I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> one who tells me that the sun is a red-hot mass and the moon an earth? Such assertions are mere logomachies, and not a sober exposition of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. How can it be otherwise than foolish to credit the books of Herodotus relating to the history of Hercules, which tell of an upper earth from which the lion came down that was killed by Hercules? And what avails the Attic style, the sorites of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, the plausibilities of syllogisms, the measurements of the earth, the positions of the stars, and the course of the sun? To be occupied in such inquiries is the work of one who imposes opinions on himself as if they were <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28. Condemnation of the Greek Legislation</h2>

<p>On this account I reject your legislation also; for there ought to be one common polity for all; but now there are as many different codes as there are states, so that things held disgraceful in some are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> in others. The Greeks consider intercourse with a mother as unlawful, but this practice is esteemed most becoming by the Persian <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>; pederasty is condemned by the Barbarians, but by the Romans, who endeavour to collect herds of boys like grazing horses, it is honoured with certain privileges.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29. Account of Tatian's Conversion</h2>

<p>Wherefore, having seen these things, and moreover also having been admitted to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and having everywhere examined the religious <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> performed by the effeminate and the pathic, and having found among the Romans their Latiarian Jupiter delighting in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> gore and the blood of slaughtered men, and Artemis not far from the great city  sanctioning acts of the same kind, and one <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> here and another there instigating to the perpetration of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>&mdash;retiring by myself, I sought how I might be able to discover the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And, while I was giving my most earnest attention to the matter, I happened to meet with certain barbaric writings, too old to be compared with the opinions of the Greeks, and too divine to be compared with their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>; and I was led to put <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in these by the unpretending cast of the language, the inartificial character of the writers, the foreknowledge displayed of future events, the excellent quality of the precepts, and the declaration of the government of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as centred in one Being.  And, my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being taught of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I discern that the former class of writings lead to condemnation, but that these put an end to the slavery that is in the world, and rescue us from a multiplicity of rulers and ten thousand tyrants, while they give us, not indeed what we had not before received, but what we had received but were prevented by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> from retaining.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30. How He Resolved to Resist the Devil</h2>

<p>Therefore, being initiated and instructed in these things, I wish to put away my former <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> as the follies of childhood. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is like that of the smallest seeds; since it has grown strong from a small beginning, but will again be destroyed if we <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and do not scatter ourselves. For He has become master of all we have by means of a certain <q>hidden treasure,</q>  which while we are digging for we are indeed covered with dust, but we secure it as our fixed possession. He who receives the whole of this treasure has obtained command of the most precious <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. Let these things, then, be said to our friends. But to you Greeks what can I say, except to request you not to rail at those who are better than yourselves, nor if they are called Barbarians to make that an occasion of banter? For, if you are willing, you will be able to find out the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of men's not being able to understand one another's language; for to those who wish to examine our principles I will give a simple and copious account of them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31. The Philosophy of the Christians More Ancient Than that of the Greeks</h2>

<p>But now it seems proper for me to demonstrate that our <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is older than the systems of the Greeks. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Homer shall be our limits, each of them being of great antiquity; the one being the oldest of poets and historians, and the other the founder of all barbarian wisdom. Let us, then, institute a comparison between them; and we shall find that our doctrines are older, not only than those of the Greeks, but than the invention of letters.  And I will not bring forward witnesses from among ourselves, but rather have recourse to Greeks. To do the former would be foolish, because it would not be allowed by you; but the other will surprise you, when, by contending against you with your own weapons, I adduce arguments of which you had no suspicion. Now the poetry of Homer, his parentage, and the time in which he flourished have been investigated by the most ancient writers&mdash;by Theagenes of Rhegium, who lived in the time of Cambyses, Stesimbrotus of Thasos and Antimachus of Colophon, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, and Dionysius the Olynthian; after them, by Ephorus of Cum&aelig;, and Philochorus the Athenian, Megaclides and Cham&aelig;leon the Peripatetics; afterwards by the grammarians, Zenodotus, Aristophanes, Callimachus, Crates, Eratosthenes, Aristarchus, and Apollodorus. Of these, Crates says that he flourished before the return of the Heraclid&aelig;, and within 80 years after the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; Eratosthenes says that it was after the 100th year from the taking of Ilium; Aristarchus, that it was about the time of the Ionian migration, which was 140 years after that event; but, according to Philochorus, after the Ionian migration, in the archonship of Archippus at Athens, 180 years after the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; Apollodorus says it was 100 years after the Ionian migration, which would be 240 years after the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Some say that he lived 90 years before the Olympiads, which would be 317 years after the taking of Troy. Others carry it down to a later date, and say that Homer was a contemporary of Archilochus; but Archilochus flourished about the 23d Olympiad, in the time of Gyges the Lydian, 500 years after Troy. Thus, concerning the age of the aforesaid poet, I mean Homer, and the discrepancies of those who have spoken of him, we have said enough in a summary manner for those who are able to investigate with accuracy. For it is possible to show that the opinions held about the facts themselves also are false. For, where the assigned dates do not agree together, it is impossible that the history should be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For what is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in writing, but the narrating of things that are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 32. The Doctrine of the Christians, is Opposed to Dissensions, and Fitted for All</h2>

<p>But with us there is no desire of vainglory, nor do we indulge in a variety of opinions. For having renounced the popular and earthly, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> the commands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and following the law of the Father of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, we reject everything which rests upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> opinion. Not only do the rich among us pursue our <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, but the poor enjoy instruction gratuitously;  for the things which come from God surpass the requital of worldly gifts. Thus we admit all who desire to hear, even old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and striplings; and, in short, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of every age are treated by us with respect, but every kind of licentiousness is kept at a distance. And in speaking we do not utter <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. It would be an excellent thing if your continuance in unbelief should receive a check; but, however that may be, let our <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> remain confirmed by the judgment pronounced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Laugh, if you please; but you will have to weep hereafter. Is it not absurd that Nestor,  who was slow at cutting his horses' reins owing to his weak and sluggish old age, is, according to you, to be admired for attempting to rival the young men in fighting, while you deride those among us who struggle against old age and occupy themselves with the things pertaining to God? Who would not laugh when you tell us that the Amazons, and Semiramis, and certain other warlike <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, while you cast reproaches on our maidens? Achilles was a youth, yet is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have been very magnanimous; and Neoptolemus was younger, but strong; Philoctetes was weak, but the divinity had need of him against Troy. What sort of man was Thersites? Yet he held a command in the army, and, if he had not through doltishness had such an unbridled tongue, he would not have been reproached for being peak-headed and bald. As for those who wish to learn our <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, we do not test them by their looks, nor do we judge of those who come to us by their outward appearance; for we argue that there may be strength of mind in all, though they may be weak in body. But your proceedings are full of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and abundant stupidity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33. Vindication of Christian Women</h2>

<p>Therefore I have been desirous to prove from the things which are esteemed <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> among you, that our institutions are marked by sober-mindedness, but that yours are in close affinity with <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>.  You who say that we talk nonsense among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and boys, among maidens and old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and scoff at us for not being with you, hear what silliness prevails among the Greeks. For their works of art are devoted to worthless objects, while they are held in higher estimation by you than even your gods; and you behave yourselves unbecomingly in what relates to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. For Lysippus cast a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Praxilla, whose poems contain nothing useful, and Menestratus one of Learchis, and Selanion one of Sappho the courtezan, and Naucydes one of Erinna the Lesbian, and Boiscus one of Myrtis, and Cephisodotus one of Myro of Byzantium, and Gomphus one of Praxigoris, and Amphistratus one of Clito. And what shall I say about Anyta, Telesilla, and Mystis? Of the first Euthycrates and Cephisodotus made a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, and of the second Niceratus, and of the third Aristodotus; Euthycrates made one of Mnesiarchis the Ephesian, Selanion one of Corinna, and Euthycrates one of Thalarchis the Argive. My object in referring to these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> is, that you may not regard as something strange what you find among us, and that, comparing the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> which are before your eyes, you may not treat the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> with scorn who among us pursue <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. This Sappho is a lewd, love-sick female, and sings her own wantonness;  but all our <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are chaste, and the maidens at their distaffs sing of divine things  more nobly than that damsel of yours. Wherefore be ashamed, you who are professed <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> yet scoff at those of the sex who hold our doctrine, as well as at the solemn assemblies they frequent.  What a noble infant did Glaucipp&eacute; present to you, who brought forth a prodigy, as is shown by her <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> cast by Niceratus, the son of Euctemon the Athenian! But, if Glaucipp&eacute; brought forth an elephant, was that a reason why she should enjoy public honours? Praxiteles and Herodotus made for you Phryn&eacute; the courtezan, and Euthycrates cast a brazen <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Panteuchis, who was pregnant by a whoremonger; and Dinomenes, because Besantis queen of the P&aelig;onians gave birth to a black infant, took pains to preserve her memory by his art. I condemn Pythagoras too, who made a figure of Europa on the bull; and you also, who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the accuser of Zeus on account of his artistic skill. And I ridicule the skill of Myron, who made a heifer and upon it a Victory because by carrying off the daughter of Agenor it had borne away the prize for <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and lewdness. The Olynthian Herodotus made <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of Glycera the courtezan and Argeia the harper. Bryaxis made a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Pasipha&euml;; and, by having a memorial of her lewdness, it seems to have been almost your desire that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of the present time should be like her.  A certain Melanipp&euml; was a wise <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and for that reason Lysistratus made her <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>. But, forsooth, you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that among us there are wise <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>!</p>

<h2>Chapter 34. Ridicule of the Statues Erected by the Greeks</h2>

<p>Worthy of very great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, certainly, was the tyrant Bhalaris, who devoured sucklings, and accordingly is exhibited by the workmanship of Polystratus the Ambraciot, even to this day, as a very wonderful man! The Agrigentines dreaded to look on that countenance of his, because of his cannibalism; but people of culture now make it their boast that they behold him in his <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>! Is it not shameful that fratricide is honoured by you who look on the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of Polynices and Eteocles, and that you have not rather buried them with their maker Pythagoras? Destroy these memorials of iniquity! Why should I contemplate with admiration the figure of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who bore thirty children, merely for the sake of the artist Periclymenus? One ought to turn away with disgust from one who bore off the fruits of great incontinence, and whom the Romans compared to a sow, which also on a like account, they say, was deemed worthy of a mystic worship. Ares committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with Aphrodit&eacute;, and Andron made an image of their offspring Harmonia. Sophron, who committed to writing trifles and absurdities, was more celebrated for his skill in casting metals, of which specimens exist even now. And not only have his tales kept the fabulist &AElig;sop in everlasting remembrance, but also the plastic art of Aristodemus has increased his celebrity. How is it then that you, who have so many poetesses whose productions are mere trash, and innumerable courtezans, and worthless men, are not ashamed to <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of our <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>? What care I to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Euanth&eacute; gave birth to an infant in the Peripatus, or to gape with wonder at the art of Callistratus, or to fix my gaze on the Ne&aelig;ra of Calliades? For she was a courtezan. La&iuml;s was a prostitute, and Turnus made her a monument of prostitution. Why are you not ashamed of the fornication of Heph&aelig;stion, even though Philo has represented him very artistically? And for what reason do you <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the hermaphrodite Ganymede by Leochares, as if you possessed something admirable? Praxiteles even made a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with the stain of impurity upon it. It behooved you, repudiating everything of this kind, to seek what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> worthy of attention, and not to turn with disgust from our mode of life while receiving with approval the shameful productions of Phil&aelig;nis and Elephantis.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35. Tatian Speaks as an Eye-Witness</h2>

<p>The things which I have thus set before you I have not learned at second hand. I have visited many lands; I have followed rhetoric, like yourselves; I have fallen in with many arts and inventions; and finally, when sojourning in the city of the Romans, I inspected the multiplicity of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> brought there by you: for I do not attempt, as is the custom with many, to strengthen my own views by the opinions of others, but I wish to give you a distinct account of what I myself have seen and felt. So, bidding farewell to the arrogance of Romans and the idle talk of <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>, and all their ill-connected opinions, I embraced our barbaric <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. I began to show how this was more ancient than your institutions,  but left my task unfinished, in order to discuss a matter which demanded more immediate attention; but now it is time I should attempt to speak concerning its doctrines. Be not offended with our teaching, nor undertake an elaborate reply filled with trifling and ribaldry, saying, <q><a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, aspiring to be above the Greeks, above the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> number of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> inquirers, has struck out a new path, and embraced the doctrines of Barbarians.</q> For what grievance is it, that men manifestly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> should be reasoned with by a man of like nature with themselves? Or how can it be irrational, according to your own sophist,  to grow old always learning something?</p>

<h2>Chapter 36. Testimony of the Chaldeans to the Antiquity of Moses</h2>

<p>But let Homer be not later than the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; let it be granted that he was contemporary with it, or even that he was in the army of Agamemnon, and, if any so please, that he lived before the invention of letters. The <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> before mentioned will be shown to have been many years older than the taking of Troy, and far more ancient than the building of Troy, or than Tros and Dardanus. To demonstrate this I will call in as witnesses the Chaldeans, the Ph&oelig;nicians and the Egyptians. And what more need I say? For it behooves one who professes to persuade his hearers to make his narrative of events very concise. Berosus, a Babylonian, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of their god Belus, born in the time of Alexander, composed for Antiochus, the third after him, the history of the Chaldeans in three books; and, narrating the acts of the kings, he mentions one of them, Nabuchodonosor by name, who made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the Ph&oelig;nicians and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>&mdash;events which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> were announced by our <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and which happened much later than the age of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, seventy years before the Persian empire. But Berosus is a very trustworthy man, and of this Juba is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, who, writing concerning the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, says that he learned the history from Berosus: there are two books of his concerning the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 37. Testimony of the Ph&oelig;nicians</h2>

<p>After the Chaldeans, the testimony of the Ph&oelig;nicians is as follows. There were among them three men, Theodotus, Hypsicrates, and Mochus; Chaitus translated their books into Greek, and also composed with exactness the lives of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. Now, in the histories of the aforesaid writers it is shown that the abduction of Europa happened under one of the kings, and an account is given of the coming of Menelaus into <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>, and of the matters relating to Chiramus,  who gave his daughter in marriage to Solomon the king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and supplied wood of all kind of trees for the building of the temple. Menander of Pergamus composed a history concerning the same things. But the age of Chiramus is somewhere about the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; but Solomon, the contemporary of Chiramus, lived much later than the age of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38. The Egyptians Place Moses in the Reign of Inachus</h2>

<p>Of the Egyptians also there are accurate chronicles. Ptolemy, not the king, but a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Mendes, is the interpreter of their affairs. This writer, narrating the acts of the kings, says that the departure of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to the places whither they went occurred in the time of king Amosis, under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. He thus speaks: <q>Amosis lived in the time of king Inachus.</q> After him, Apion the grammarian, a man most highly esteemed, in the fourth book of his &AElig;gyptiaca (there are five books of his), besides many other things, says that Amosis destroyed Avaris in the time of the Argive Inachus, as the Mendesian Ptolemy wrote in his annals. But the time from Inachus to the taking of Troy occupies twenty generations. The steps of the demonstration are the following:&mdash; </p>

<h2>Chapter 39. Catalogue of the Argive Kings</h2>

<p>The kings of the Argives were these: Inachus, Phoroneus, Apis, Criasis, Triopas, Argeius, Phorbas, Crotopas, Sthenelaus, Danaus, Lynceus, Pr&oelig;tus, Abas, Acrisius, Perseus, Sthenelaus, Eurystheus, Atreus, Thyestes, and Agamemnon, in the eighteenth year of whose reign Troy was taken. And every intelligent person will most carefully observe that, according to the tradition of the Greeks, they possessed no historical composition; for Cadmus, who taught them letters, came into B&oelig;otia many generations later. But after Inachus, under Phoroneus, a check was with difficulty given to their savage and nomadic life, and they entered upon a new order of things. Wherefore, if <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is shown to be contemporary with Inachus, he is four hundred years older than the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. But this is demonstrated from the succession of the Attic, [and of the Macedonian, the Ptolemaic, and the <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antiochian</a>]  kings. Hence, if the most illustrious <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> among the Greeks were recorded and made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> after Inachus, it is manifest that this must have been after <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. In the time of Phoroneus, who was after Inachus, Ogygus is mentioned among the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>, in whose time was the first deluge; and in the time of Phorbas was Act&aelig;us, from whom Attica was called Act&aelig;a; and in the time of Triopas were Prometheus, and Epimetheus, and Atlas, and Cecrops of double nature, and Io; in the time of Crotopas was the burning of Pha&euml;thon and the flood of Deucalion; in the time of Sthenelus was the reign of Amphictyon and the coming of Danaus into Peloponnesus, and the founding of Dardania by Dardanus, and the return of Europa from <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a> to Crete; in the time of Lynceus was the abduction of Kor&eacute;, and the founding of the temple in Eleusis, and the husbandry of Triptolemus, and the coming of Cadmus to Thebes, and the reign of Minos; in the time of Pr&oelig;tus was the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of Eumolpus against the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>; in the time of Acrisius was the coming over of Pelops from Phrygia, and the coming of Ion to Athens, and the second Cecrops, and the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of Perseus and Dionysus, and Mus&aelig;us, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Orpheus; and in the reign of Agamemnon Troy was taken.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40. Moses More Ancient and Credible Than the Heathen Heroes</h2>

<p>Therefore, from what has been said it is evident that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was older than the ancient heroes, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. And we ought rather to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him, who stands before them in point of age, than the Greeks, who, without being aware of it,  drew his doctrines [as] from a fountain. For many of the sophists among them, stimulated by curiosity, endeavoured to adulterate whatever they learned from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>,  and from those who have philosophized like him, first that they might be considered as having something of their own, and secondly, that covering up by a certain rhetorical artifice whatever things they did not understand, they might misrepresent the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as if it were a fable. But what the learned among the Greeks have said concerning our polity and the history of our <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and how many and what kind of men have written of these things, will be shown in the treatise against those who have discoursed of divine things. </p>

<h2>Chapter 41</h2>

<p>But the matter of principal importance is to endeavour with all accuracy to make it clear that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is not only older than Homer, but than all the writers that were before him&mdash; older than Linus, Philammon, Thamyris, Amphion, Mus&aelig;us, Orpheus, Demodocus, Phemius, Sibylla, Epimenides of Crete, who came to Sparta, Arist&aelig;us of Proconnesus, who wrote the Arimaspia, Asbolus the Centaur, Isatis, Drymon, Euclus the Cyprian, Horus the Samian, and Pronapis the Athenian. Now, Linus was the teacher of Hercules, but Hercules preceded the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> by one generation; and this is manifest from his son Tlepolemus, who served in the army against Troy. And Orpheus lived at the same time as Hercules; moreover, it is said that all the works attributed to him were composed by Onomacritus the Athenian, who lived during the reign of the Pisistratids, about the fiftieth Olympiad. Mus&aelig;us was a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Orpheus. Amphion, since he preceded the siege of Troy by two generations, forbids our collecting further particulars about him for those who are desirous of information. Demodocus and Phemius lived at the very time of the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; for the one resided with the suitors, and the other with the Ph&oelig;acians. Thamyris and Philammon were not much earlier than these. Thus, concerning their several performances in each kind, and their times and the record of them, we have written very fully, and, as I think, with all exactness. But, that we may complete what is still wanting, I will give my explanation respecting the men who are esteemed wise. Minos, who has been thought to excel in every kind of wisdom, and mental acuteness, and legislative capacity, lived in the time of Lynceus, who reigned after Danaus in the eleventh generation after Inachus. Lycurgus, who was born long after the taking of Troy, gave <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to the Lacedemonians. Draco is found to have lived about the thirty-ninth Olympiad, Solon about the forty-sixth, and Pythagoras about the sixty-second. We have shown that the Olympiads commenced 407 years after the taking of Troy. These facts being demonstrated, we shall briefly remark concerning the age of the seven wise men. The oldest of these, Thales, lived about the fiftieth Olympiad; and I have already spoken briefly of those who came after him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 42. Concluding Statement as to the Author</h2>

<p>These things, O Greeks, I <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the barbarian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>,  have composed for you. I was born in the land of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, having been first instructed in your doctrines, and afterwards in those which I now undertake to proclaim. Henceforward, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> who God is and what is His work, I present myself to you prepared for an examination  concerning my doctrines, while I adhere immoveably to that mode of life which is according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>
