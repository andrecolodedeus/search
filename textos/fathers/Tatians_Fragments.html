<h1>Tatian's Fragments</h1>

<h2>1</h2>

<p>In his treatise, <em>Concerning Perfection according to the Saviour</em>, he writes, <q>Consent indeed fits for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, but fellowship in corruption weakens supplication. At any rate, by the permission he certainly, though delicately, forbids; for while he permits them to return to the same on account of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and incontinence, he exhibits a man who will attempt to serve two masters&mdash; God by the 'consent' <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 7:5</a></span>, but by want of consent, incontinence, fornication, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q>&mdash; <span class="sc">Clem. Alex.</span>: <em>Strom.</em>, iii. c. 12.</p>
<h2>2</h2>

<p>A certain person inveighs against generation, calling it corruptible and destructive; and some one does <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> [to Scripture], applying to pro-creation the Saviour's words, <q>Lay not up treasure on earth, where moth and rust corrupt;</q> and he is not ashamed to add to these the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>You all shall grow old as a garment, and the moth shall devour you.</q></p>

<p>And, in like manner, they adduce the saying concerning the resurrection of the dead, <q>The sons of that world neither marry nor are given in marriage.</q>&mdash; <span class="sc">Clem. Alex.</span>: iii. c. 12, &sect; 86.</p>
<h2>3</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, who maintaining the imaginary flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, pronounces all sexual connection impure, who was also the very violent heresiarch of the <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>, employs an argument of this sort: <q>If any one sows to the flesh, of the flesh he shall reap corruption;</q> but he sows to the flesh who is joined to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; therefore he who takes a wife and sows in the flesh, of the flesh he shall reap corruption.&mdash; Hieron .: <em>Com. in Ep. ad Gal.</em></p>
<h2>4</h2>

<p>Seceding from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and being elated and puffed up by a conceit of his teacher,  as if he were superior to the rest, he formed his own peculiar type of doctrine. Imagining certain invisible <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> like those of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, and denouncing marriage as defilement and fornication in the same way as <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and Saturninus, and denying the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> as an opinion of his own.&mdash; <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a></span>: Adv. H&oelig;r., i. 28.</p>
<h2>5</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> attempting from time to time to make use of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> language, that in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, but ignoring that <q>where <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> abounded, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has much more abounded.</q>&mdash; <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a></span>: <em>Adv. Heres.</em>, iii. 37.</p>
<h2>6</h2>

<p>Against <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, who says that the words, <q>Let there be light,</q> are to be taken as a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. If He who uttered it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> a superior <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how is it that He says, <q>I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there is none beside me</q>?</p>

<p>He said that there are punishments for <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, foolish talking, and licentious words, which are punished and chastised by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>. And he said that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were punished on account of their hair and ornaments by a power placed over those things, which also gave strength to Samson by his hair, and punishes those who by the ornament of their hair are urged on to fornication.&mdash; <span class="sc">Clem. Alex.</span>: <em>Frag.</em></p>
<h2>7</h2>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, not understanding that the expression <q>Let there be</q> is not always precative but sometimes imperative, most impiously imagined concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who said <q>Let there be light,</q> that He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> rather than commanded light to be, as if, as he impiously thought, God was in darkness.&mdash; <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a></span>: <em>De Orat.</em></p>
<h2>8</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> separates the old man and the new, but not, as we say, understanding the old man to be the law, and the new man to be the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. We agree with him in saying the same thing, but not in the sense he wishes, abrogating the law as if it belonged to another God.&mdash; <span class="sc">Clem. Alex.</span>: <em>Strom.</em>, iii. 12.</p>
<h2>9</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> condemns and rejects not only marriage, but also meats which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has created for use.&mdash; Hieron.: <em>Adv. Jovin</em>., i. 3.</p>
<h2>10</h2>

<p><q>But you gave the Nazarites wine to drink, and commanded the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, saying, Prophesy not.</q> On this, perhaps, <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> the chief of the <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a> endeavours to build his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, asserting that wine is not to be drunk, since it was commanded in the law that the Nazarites were not to drink wine, and now those who give the Nazarites wine are accused by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.&mdash; Hieron.: <em>Com. in Amos.</em></p>
<h2>11</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, the patriarch of the <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>, who himself rejected some of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> Epistles, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> this especially, that is [addressed] to Titus, ought to be declared to be the apostle's, thinking little of the assertion of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and others, who agree with him on this point.&mdash; Hieron.: <em>Pr&aelig;f. in Com. ad Tit.</em></p>
<h2>12</h2>

<p>[Archelaus (a.d. 280), Bishop of Carrha in Mesopotamia, classes his countryman <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> with <q><a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, Sabellius, and others who have made up for themselves a peculiar science,</q> i.e., a theology of their own.&mdash; Routh: <em>Reliqui&aelig;</em>, tom. v. p. 137. But see Edinburgh Series of this work, vol. xx. p. 267.]</p>
