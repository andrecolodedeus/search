<h1>The Acts of Barnabas</h1>

<p><strong>The Journeyings and Martyrdom of St. Barnabas the Apostle.</strong></p>

<p>Since from the descent of the presence of our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the unwearied and benevolent and mighty Shepherd and Teacher and Physician, I beheld and saw the ineffable and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and unspotted <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who hold the hope in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and who have been sealed; and since I have <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> served Him, I have deemed it necessary to give account of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> which I have heard and seen.</p>

<p>I John, accompanying the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, being formerly a servant of Cyrillus the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of Jupiter, but now having received the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> through <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> and Silas, <em>who were</em> worthy of the calling, and who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> me in Iconium. After I was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, then, I saw a certain man standing clothed in white raiment; and he said to me: Be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, John, for assuredly your name shall be changed to Mark, and your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall be proclaimed in all the world. And the darkness in you has passed away from you, and there has been given to you understanding to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>And when I saw the vision, becoming greatly terrified, I went to the feet of Barnabas, and related to him the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> which I had seen and heard from that man. And the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> was not by when I disclosed the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. And Barnabas said to me: Tell no one the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> which you have seen. For by me also this night the Lord stood, saying, Be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>: for as you have given your life for my name to death and banishment from your nation, thus also shall you be made perfect. Moreover, as for the servant who is with you, take him also with yourself; for he has certain <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. Now then, my child, keep to yourself the things which you have seen and heard; for a time will come for you to reveal them. </p>

<p>And I, having been instructed in these things by him, remained in Iconium  many days; for there was there a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man and a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, who also entertained us, whose house also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had sanctified. Thence, therefore, we came to Seleucia, and after staying three days sailed away to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>; and I was ministering to them until we had gone round all <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>. And setting sail from <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, we landed in Perga of Pamphylia. And there I then stayed about two months, wishing to sail to the regions of the West; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> did not allow me. Turning, therefore, I again sought the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; and having learned that they were in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, I went to them.</p>

<p>And I found <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in bed in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> from the toil of the journey, who also seeing me, was exceedingly grieved on account of my delaying in Pamphylia. And Barnabas coming, encouraged him, and tasted bread, and he took a little of it. And they preached the word of the Lord, and enlightened many of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks. And I only attended to them, and was afraid of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to come near him, both because he held me as having spent much time in Pamphylia, and because he was quite enraged against me. And I gave repentance on my knees upon the earth to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and he would not endure it. And when I remained for three <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a> in entreaty and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> on my knees, I was unable to prevail upon him about myself; for his great grievance against me was on account of my keeping several parchments in Pamphylia.</p>

<p>And when it came to pass that they finished teaching in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, on the first of the week they took counsel together to set out for the places of the East, and after that to go into <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and oversee all the churches in which they had spoken the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And Barnabas entreated <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to go first to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and oversee his own in his village; and Lucius  entreated him to take the oversight of his city Cyrene. And a vision was seen by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in sleep, that he should hasten to Jerusalem, because the brethren expected him there. But Barnabas urged that they should go to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and pass the winter, and then that they should go to Jerusalem at the feast. Great contention, therefore, arose between them. <span class="stiki" id="note082136"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse39">Acts&nbsp;15:39</a></span> And Barnabas urged me also to accompany them, on account of my being their servant from the beginning, and on account of my having served them in all <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> until they came to Perga of Pamphylia; and I there had remained many days. But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> cried out against Barnabas, saying: It is impossible for him to go with us. And those who were with us there urged me also to accompany them, because there was a vow upon me to follow them to the end. So that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said to Barnabas: If you will take John who also is surnamed Mark with you, go another road; for he shall not come with us. And Barnabas coming to himself, said: The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God does not desert  him who has once served the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and journeyed with us. If, therefore, this be agreeable to you, Father <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, I take him and go. And he said: You go in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and we in the power of the Spirit.</p>

<p>Therefore, bending their knees, they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, groaning aloud, wept, and in like manner also Barnabas, saying to one another: It would have been good for us, as at first, so also at last, to work in common among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; but since it has thus seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to you, Father <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me that my labour may be made perfect to commendation: for you know how I have served you also to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ that has been given to you. For I go to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and hasten to be made perfect;  for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I shall no more see your face, O Father <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. And falling on the ground at his feet, he wept long. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said to him: The Lord stood by me also this night, saying, Do not force Barnabas not to go to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, for there it has been prepared for him to enlighten many; and go also, in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that has been given to you, to Jerusalem to worship in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, and there it shall be shown you where your <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> has been prepared. And we saluted one another, and Barnabas took me to himself.</p>

<p>And having come down to Laodiceia,  we sought to cross to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>; and having found a ship going to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, we embarked. And when we had set sail, the wind was found to be contrary. And we came to Corasium;  and having gone down to the shore where there was a fountain, we rested there, showing ourselves to no one, that no one might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Barnabas had separated from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. And having set sail from Corasium, we came to the regions of Isauria, and thence came to a certain island called Pityusa;  and a storm having come on, we remained there three days; and a certain <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man entertained us, by name Euphemus, whom also Barnabas instructed in many things in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, with all his house.</p>

<p>And thence we sailed past the Aconesi&aelig;,  and came to the city of Anemurium; and having gone into it, we found two Greeks. And coming to us, they asked whence and who we were. And Barnabas said to them: If you wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence and who we are, throw away the clothing which you have, and I shall put on you clothing which never becomes soiled; for neither is there in it anything filthy, but it is altogether splendid. And being astonished at the saying, they asked us: What is that garment which you are going to give us? And Barnabas said to them: If you shall confess your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and submit yourselves to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, you shall receive that garment which is incorruptible for ever. And being pricked at heart by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, they fell at his feet, entreating and saying: We beseech you, father, give us that garment; for we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the living and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God whom you proclaim. And leading them down to  the fountain, he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> them into the name of Father, and Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that they were clothed with power, and a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> robe. And having taken from me one robe, he put it on the one; and his own robe he put on the other. And they brought money to him, and straightway Barnabas distributed it to the poor. And from them also the sailors were able to gain many things. </p>

<p>And they having come down to the shore, he spoke to them the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and he having blessed them, we saluted them, and went on board the ship. And the one of them who was named Stephanus wished to accompany us, and Barnabas did not permit him. And we, having gone across, sailed down to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> by night; and having come to the place called Crommyacita,  we found Timon and Ariston the temple servants, at whose house also we were entertained.</p>

<p>And Timon was afflicted by much fever. And having laid our hands upon him, we straightway removed his fever, having called upon the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>. And Barnabas had received documents from Matthew, a book of the word  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a narrative of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and doctrines. This Barnabas laid upon the sick in each place that we came to, and it immediately made a cure of their sufferings.</p>

<p>And when we had come to Lapithus,  and an idol festival  being celebrated in the theatre, they did not allow us to go into the city, but we rested a little at the gate. And Timon, after he rose up from his disease, came with us. And having gone forth from Lapithus, we travelled through the mountains, and came to the city of Lampadistus, of which also Timon was a native; in addition to whom, having found also that Heracleius was there, we were entertained by him. He was of the city of Tamasus,  and had come to visit his relations; and Barnabas, looking steadfastly at him, recognised him, having met with him formerly at Citium with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; to whom also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was given at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and he changed his name to Heracleides. And having ordained him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> over <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and having confirmed the church in Tamasus, we left him in the house of his brethren that dwelt there.</p>

<p>And having crossed the mountain called Chionodes,  we came to Old Paphos, and there found Rhodon, a temple servant, who also, having himself <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, accompanied us. And we met a certain Jew, by name Barjesus, coming from Paphos, who also recognised Barnabas, as having been formerly with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. He did not wish us to go into Paphos; but having turned away, we came to Curium. </p>

<p>And we found that a certain abominable race was being performed  in the road near the city, where a multitude of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and men naked were performing the race. And there was great deception and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in that place. And Barnabas turning, rebuked it; and the western part fell, so that many were wounded, and many of them also died and the rest fled to the temple of Apollo, which was close at hand in the <em>city</em>, which was called sacred.  And when we came near the temple, a great multitude of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who were there, having been put up to it by Barjesus, stood outside of the city, and did not allow us to go into the city; but we spent the evening under a tree near the city, and rested there.</p>

<p>And on the following day, we came to a certain village where Aristoclianus dwelt. He being a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, had been cleansed in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, whom also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> sealed to be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and sent to his village in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, because there were many Greeks there. And we were entertained in the cave by him in the mountain, and there we remained one day. And thence we came to Amathus and there was a great multitude of Greeks in the temple in the mountain, low <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and men pouring libations. There also Barjesus, getting the start of us, gained over the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and did not allow us to enter into the city; but a certain <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, eighty years old, being outside of the city, and she also not worshipping the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, coming forward to us, took us into her house one hour. And when we came out we shook the dust off our feet over against that temple where the libation of the abominable took place.</p>

<p>And having gone out thence, we came through desert places, and Timon also accompanied us. And having come to Citium, and there being a great uproar there also in their hippodrome, having learned this, we came forth out of the city, having all shaken the dust off our feet; for no one received us, except that we rested one hour in the gate near the aqueduct.</p>

<p>And having set sail in a ship from Citium, we came to Salamis, and landed in the so-called islands, where there was a place full of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; and there there took place high festivals  and libations. And having found Heracleides there again, we instructed him to proclaim the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to set up churches, and ministers in them. And having gone into Salamis, we came to the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> near the place called Biblia; and when we had gone into it, Barnabas, having unrolled the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which he had received from Matthew his fellow-labourer, began to teach the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</p>

<p>And Barjesus, having arrived after two days, after not a few <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had been instructed, was enraged, and brought together all the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and they having laid hold of Barnabas, wished to hand him over to Hypatius, the governor of Salamis. And having bound him to take him away to the governor, and a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Jebusite,  a kinsman of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, having come to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, learning this, took Barnabas by night, and bound him with a rope by the neck; and having dragged him to the hippodrome from the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and having gone out of the city, standing round him, they burned him with fire, so that even his bones became dust. And straightway that night, having taken his dust, they cast it into a cloth; and having secured it with lead, they intended to throw it into the sea. But I, finding an opportunity in the night, and being able along with Timon and Rhodon to carry it. we came to a certain place, and having found a cave, put it down there, where the nation of the Jebusites formerly dwelt. And having found a secret place in it, we put it away, with the documents which he had received from Matthew. And it was the fourth hour of the night of the second of the week. </p>

<p>And when we were hid in the place, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> made no little search after us; and having almost found us, they pursued us as far as the village of the Ledrians; and we, having found there also a cave near the village, took refuge in it, and thus escaped them. And we were hid in the cave three days; and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> having gone away, we came forth and left the place by night. And taking with us Ariston and Rhodon, we came to the village of Limnes. </p>

<p>And having come to the shore, we found an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> ship; and having embarked in it, we landed at Alexandria. And there I remained, teaching the brethren that came the word of the Lord, enlightening them, and preaching what I had been taught by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> me into the name of Father, and Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; who also changed my name to Mark in the water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, by which also I hope to bring many to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; because to Him is due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and everlasting <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p>The journeyings and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> apostle Barnabas have been fulfilled through God.</p>
