<h1>The Acts of Paul and Thecla</h1>

<p>As <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was going up to Iconium after the flight from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, his fellow-travellers were Demas and Ermogenes, full of hypocrisy; and they were importunate with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>,  as if they loved him. But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, looking only to the goodness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, did them no harm, but loved them exceedingly, so that he made the oracles of the Lord sweet to them in the teaching both of the birth and the resurrection of the Beloved; and he gave them an account, word for word, of the great things of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, how He  had been revealed to him.</p>

<p>And a certain man, by name Onesiphorus, hearing that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had come to Iconium, went out to meet him with his children Silas and Zeno, and his wife Lectra, in order that he might entertain him: for Titus had informed him what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was like in appearance: for he had not seen him in the flesh, but only in the spirit. And he went along the road to Lystra, and stood waiting for him, and kept looking at the passers by according to the description of Titus. And he saw <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> coming, a man small in size, bald-headed, bandy-legged, well-built,  with eyebrows meeting, rather long-nosed, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For sometimes he seemed like a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and sometimes he had the countenance of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, seeing Onesiphorus, smiled; and Onesiphorus said: Hail, O servant of the blessed God! And he said: Grace be with you and your house. And Demas and Ermogenes were jealous, and showed greater hypocrisy; so that Demas said: Are not we of the blessed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you have not thus saluted us? And Onesiphorus said: I do not see in you the fruit of righteousness; but if such you be, come you also into my house and rest yourselves.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> having gone into the house of Onesiphorus, there was great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and bending of knees, and breaking of bread, and the word of God about self-control and the resurrection; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> saying: Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God: <span class="stiki" id="note082109"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> blessed are they that have kept the flesh chaste, for they shall become a temple of God: <span class="stiki" id="note082110"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:18-19</a></span> blessed are they that control themselves, for God shall speak with them: blessed are they that have kept aloof from this world, for they shall be called upright: <span class="stiki" id="note082111"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;12:2</a></span> blessed are they that have wives as not having them, for they shall receive God for their portion: <span class="stiki" id="note082112"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:29</a></span> blessed are they that have the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for they shall become <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God: <span class="stiki" id="note082113"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse36">Luke&nbsp;20:36</a></span> blessed are they that have kept the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, for they shall rest beside the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>: blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy, <span class="stiki" id="note082114"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;5:7</a></span> and shall not see the bitter day of judgment: blessed are the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, for they shall be well pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and shall not lose the reward of their <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; for the word of the Father shall become to them a work of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> against the day of His Son, and they shall have rest for ever and ever. </p>

<p>And while <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was thus speaking in the midst of the church in the house of Onesiphorus, a certain virgin Thecla, the daughter of Theocleia, <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to a man <em>named</em> Thamyris, sitting at the window close by, listened night and day to the discourse of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and did not look away from the window, but paid earnest heed to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, rejoicing exceedingly. And when she still saw many <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> going in beside <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, she also had an eager desire to be deemed worthy to stand in the presence of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and to hear the word of Christ; for never had she seen his figure, but heard his word only.</p>

<p>And as she did not stand away from the window, her mother sends to Thamyris; and he comes gladly, as if already receiving her in marriage. And Theocleia said: I have a strange story to tell you, Thamyris; for assuredly for three days and three nights Thecla does not rise from the window, neither to eat nor to drink; but looking earnestly as if upon some pleasant sight, she is so devoted to a foreigner teaching deceitful and artful discourses, that I wonder how a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> of such modesty is so painfully put about. Thamyris, this man will overturn the city of the Iconians, and your Thecla too besides; for all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and the young men go in beside him, being taught to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God and to live in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Moreover also my daughter, tied to the window like a spider, lays hold of what is said by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> with a strange eagerness and awful emotion; for the virgin looks eagerly at what is said by him, and has been captivated. But go near and speak to her, for she has been <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to you.</p>

<p>And Thamyris going near, and kissing her, but at the same time also being afraid of her overpowering emotion, said: Thecla, my <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, why do you sit thus? And what sort of feeling holds you overpowered? Turn round to your Thamyris, and be ashamed. Moreover also her mother said the same things: Why do you sit thus looking down, my child, and answering nothing, but like a mad <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? And they wept fearfully, Thamyris indeed for the loss of a wife, and Theocleia of a child, and the maidservants of a mistress: there was accordingly much confusion in the house of mourning.  And while these things were thus going on, Thecla did not turn round, but kept attending earnestly to the word of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.</p>

<p>And Thamyris starting up, went forth into the street, and kept watching those going in to him and coming out. And he saw two men bitterly contending with each other; and he said: Men, tell me who this is among you, leading astray the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of young men, and deceiving <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, so that they do not marry, but remain as they are. I promise, therefore, to give you money enough if you tell me about him; for I am the first man  of the city. And Demas and Ermogenes said to him: Who this is, indeed, we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; but he deprives young men of wives, and maidens of husbands, saying, There is for you a resurrection in no other way, unless you remain chaste, and pollute not the flesh, but keep it chaste. And Thamyris said to them: Come into my house, and rest yourselves. And they went to a sumptuous dinner, and much wine, and great <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and a splendid table; and Thamyris made them drink, from his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to Thecla, and his wish to get her as his wife. And Thamyris said during the dinner: You men, what is his teaching, tell me, that I also may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; for I am no little distressed about Thecla, because she thus loves the stranger, and I am prevented from marrying.</p>

<p>Demas and Ermogenes said: Bring him before the governor Castelios on the charge of persuading the multitudes to embrace the new teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and he will speedily destroy him, and you shall have Thecla as your wife. And we shall teach you that the resurrection of which this man speaks has taken place, because it has already taken place in the children which we have;  and we rose again when we came to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</p>

<p>And Thamyris, hearing these things, being filled with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and rage, rising up early, went to the house of Onesiphorus with archons and public officers, and a great crowd with batons, saying: You have corrupted the city of the Iconians, and her that was <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to me, so that she will not have me: let us go to the governor Castelios. And all the multitude said: Away with the magician; for he has corrupted all our wives, and the multitudes have been persuaded <em>to change their opinions</em>.</p>

<p>And Thamyris, standing before the tribunal, said with a great shout: O proconsul, this man, who he is we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, who makes <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> averse to marriage; let him say before you on what  account he teaches these things. And Demas and Ermogenes said to Thamyris: Say that he is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and thus you will do away with him. But the proconsul stayed his intention, and called <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, saying: Who are you, and what do you teach? For they bring no small charges against you. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> lifted up his voice, saying: Since I am this day examined as to what I teach, listen, O proconsul: A living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a God of retributions, a jealous <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a God in need of nothing, consulting for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, has sent me that I may reclaim them from corruption and uncleanness, and from all pleasure, and from death, that they may not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Wherefore God sent His own Son, whom I preach, and in whom I teach men to rest their hope, who alone has had compassion upon a world led astray, that they may be no longer under judgment, O proconsul, but may have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. If, therefore, I teach what has been revealed to me by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherein do I do wrong? And the proconsul having heard, ordered <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to be bound, and sent to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, until, said he, I, being at leisure, shall hear him more attentively.</p>

<p>And Thecla by night having taken off her bracelets, gave them to the gatekeeper; and the door having been opened to her, she went into the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; and having given the jailor a silver mirror, she went in beside <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and, sitting at his feet, she heard the great things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was afraid of nothing, but ordered his life in the confidence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> also was increased, and she kissed his bonds.</p>

<p>And when Thecla was sought for by her friends, and Thamyris, as if she had been lost, was running up and down the streets, one of the gatekeeper's fellow-slaves informed him that she had gone out by night. And having gone out, they examined the gatekeeper; and he said to them: She has gone to the foreigner into the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. And having gone, they found her, as it were, enchained by affection. And having gone forth thence, they drew the multitudes together, and informed the governor of the circumstance. And he ordered <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to be brought to the tribunal; but Thecla was wallowing on the ground  in the place where he sat and taught her in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; and he ordered her too to be brought to the tribunal. And she came, exulting with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. And the crowd, when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had been brought, vehemently cried out: He is a magician! Away with him! But the proconsul gladly heard <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> works of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And having called a council, he summoned Thecla, and said to her: Why do you not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Thamyris, according to the law of the Iconians? But she stood looking earnestly at <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. And when she gave no answer, her mother cried out, saying: Burn the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <em>wretch;</em> burn in the midst of the theatre her that will not marry, in order that all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that have been taught by this man may be afraid.</p>

<p>And the governor was greatly moved; and having scourged <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, he cast him out of the city, and condemned Thecla to be burned. And immediately the governor went away to the theatre, and all the crowd went forth to the spectacle of Thecla. But as a lamb in the wilderness looks round for the shepherd, so she kept searching for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. And having looked upon the crowd, she saw the Lord sitting in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and said: As I am unable to endure my lot, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> has come to see me. And she gazed upon him with great earnestness, and he went up into heaven. But the maid-servants  and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> brought the faggots, in order that Thecla might be burned. And when she came in naked, the governor wept, and wondered at the power  that was in her. And the public executioners arranged the faggots for her to go up on the pile. And she, having made the sign of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, went up on the faggots; and they lighted them. And though a great fire was blazing, it did not touch her; for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having compassion upon her, made an underground rumbling, and a cloud overshadowed them from above, full of water and hail; and all that was in the cavity of it was poured out, so that many were in danger of death. And the fire was put out, and Thecla saved.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> with Onesiphorus and his wife, and his children, in a new tomb, as they were going from Iconium to Daphne. And when many days were past, the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> children said to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: We are hungry, and we cannot buy loaves; for Onesiphorus had left the things of the world, and followed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, with all his house. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, having taken off his cloak, said: Go, my child, buy more loaves, and bring them. And when the child was buying, he saw Thecla their neighbour, and was astonished, and said: Thecla, whither are you going? And she said: I have been saved from the fire, and am following <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. And the boy said: Come, I shall take you to him; for he is distressed about you, and is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> six days. And she stood beside the tomb where <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was with bended knees, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, and saying: O Saviour Christ, let not the fire touch Thecla, but stand by her, for she is Yours. And she, standing behind him, cried out: O Father, who hast made the heaven and the earth, the Father of Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Son, I bless You that You have saved me that I may see <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, rising up, saw her, and said: O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> the heart, the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, I bless You that  You, having heard me, have done quickly what I wished.</p>

<p>And they had five loaves, and herbs, and water; and they rejoiced in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> works of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And Thecla said to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: I shall cut my hair, and follow you wherever you may go. And he said: It is a shameless age, and you are beautiful. I am afraid lest another <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> come upon you worse than the first, and that you withstand it not, but be cowardly. And Thecla said: Only give me the seal  in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> shall not touch me. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: Thecla, wait with patience, and you shall receive the water.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> sent away Onesiphorus and all his house to Iconium; and thus, having taken Thecla, he went into <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. And as they were going in, a certain Syriarch, Alexander by name, seeing Thecla, became enamoured of her, and tried to gain over <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> by gifts and presents. But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom you speak of, nor is she mine. But he, being of great power, himself embraced her in the street. But she would not endure it, but looked about for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. And she cried out bitterly, saying: Do not force the stranger; do not force the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I am one of the chief <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the Iconians; and because I would not have Thamyris, I have been cast out of the city. And taking hold of Alexander, she tore his cloak, and pulled off his crown, and made him a laughing-stock. And he, at the same time loving her, and at the same time ashamed of what had happened, led her before the governor; and when she had confessed that she had done these things, he condemned her to the wild beasts. And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were struck with astonishment, and cried out beside the tribunal: Evil judgment! Impious judgment! And she asked the governor, that, said she, I may remain pure until I shall fight with the wild beasts. And a certain Tryph&aelig;na,  whose daughter was dead, took her into keeping, and had her for a consolation.</p>

<p>And when the beasts were exhibited, they bound her to a fierce lioness; and Tryph&aelig;na accompanied her. But the lioness, with Thecla sitting upon her, licked her feet; and all the multitude was astonished. And the charge on her inscription was: Sacrilegious. And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> cried out from above: An impious sentence has been passed in this city! And after the exhibition, Tryph&aelig;na again receives her. For her daughter Falconilla had died, and said to her in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>: Mother, you shall have this stranger Thecla in my place, in order that she may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> concerning me, and that I may be transferred to the place of the just.</p>

<p>And when, after the exhibition, Tryph&aelig;na received her, at the same time indeed she grieved that she had to fight with the wild beasts on the day following; and at the same time, loving her as much as her daughter Falconilla, she said: My second child Thecla, come and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for my child, that she may live for ever; for this I saw in my sleep. And she, nothing hesitating, lifted up her voice, and said: God most high,  grant to this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> according to her wish, that her daughter Falconilla may live for ever. And when Thecla had thus spoken, Tryph&aelig;na lamented, considering so much beauty thrown to the wild beasts.</p>

<p>And when it was dawn, Alexander came to take her, for it was he that gave the hunt,  saying: The governor is sitting, and the crowd is in uproar against us. Allow me to take away her that is to fight with the wild beasts. And Tryph&aelig;na cried aloud, so that he even fled, saying: A second mourning for my Falconilla has come upon my house and there is no one to help; neither child, for she is dead, nor kinsman, for I am a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. God of Thecla, help her!</p>

<p>And immediately the governor sends an order that Thecla should be brought. And Tryph&aelig;na, taking her by the hand, said: My daughter Falconilla, indeed, I took away to the tomb; and you, Thecla, I am taking to the wild-beast fight. And Thecla wept bitterly, saying: O Lord, the God in whom I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, to whom I have fled for refuge, who delivered me from the fire, grant a recompense to Tryph&aelig;na, who has had compassion on Your servant, and because she has kept me pure. Then a tumult arose, and a cry of the people, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> sitting together, the one saying: Away with the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> person! The others saying: Let the city be raised  against this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Take off all of us, O proconsul! Cruel sight! <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> sentence!</p>

<p>And Thecla, having been taken out of the hand of Tryph&aelig;na, was stripped, and received a girdle,  and was thrown into the arena, and lions and bears and a fierce lioness were let loose upon her; and the lioness having run up to her feet, lay down; and the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> cried aloud. And a bear ran upon her; but the lioness, meeting the bear, tore her to pieces. And again a lion that had been trained against men, which belonged to Alexander, ran upon her; and she, <em>the lioness</em>, encountering the lion, was killed along with him. And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> made great lamentation, since also the lioness, her protector, was dead.</p>

<p>Then they send in many wild beasts, she standing and stretching forth her hands, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>. And when she had finished her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, she turned and saw a ditch full of water, and said: Now it is time to wash myself. And she threw herself in, saying: In the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> I am <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> on my last day. And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> seeing, and the multitude, wept, saying: Do not throw yourself into the water; so that also the governor shed tears, because the seals were going to devour such beauty. She then threw herself <em>in</em> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; but the seals having seen the glare of the fire of lightning, floated about dead. And there was round her, as she was naked, a cloud of fire; so that neither could the wild beasts touch her, nor could she be seen naked.</p>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, when other wild beasts were being thrown in, wailed. And some threw sweet-smelling herbs, others nard, others cassia, others amomum, so that there was abundance of perfumes. And all the wild beasts that had been thrown in, as if they had been withheld by sleep, did not touch her; so that Alexander said to the governor: I have bulls exceedingly terrible; let us bind to them her that is to fight with the beasts. And the governor, looking gloomy, turned, and said: Do what you will. And they bound her by the feet between them, and put red-hot irons under the privy parts of the bulls, so that they, being rendered more <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a>, might kill her. They rushed about, therefore; but the burning flame consumed the ropes, and she was as if she had not been bound. But Tryph&aelig;na fainted standing beside the arena, so that the crowd said: Queen Tryph&aelig;na is dead. And the governor put a stop to the games, and the city was in dismay. And Alexander entreated the governor, saying: Have mercy both on me and the city, and release this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. For if C&aelig;sar hear of these things, he will speedily destroy the city also along with us, because his kinswoman Queen Tryph&aelig;na has died beside the Abaci . </p>

<p>And the governor summoned Thecla out of the midst of the wild beasts, and said to her: Who are you? And what is there about you, that not one of the wild beasts touches you? And she said: I indeed am a servant of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and as to what there is about me, I have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, in whom He is well pleased; wherefore not one of the beasts has touched me. For He alone is the end  of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and the basis of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life; for He is a refuge to the tempest-tossed, a solace to the afflicted, a shelter to the despairing; and, once for all, whoever shall not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, shall not live for ever.</p>

<p>And the governor having heard this, ordered her garments to be brought, and to be put on. And Thecla said: He that clothed me naked among the wild beasts, will in the day of judgment clothe you with <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And taking the garments, she put them on. The governor therefore immediately issued an edict, saying: I release to you the God-fearing Thecla, the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> shouted aloud, and with one mouth returned thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying: There is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, <em>the God</em> of Thecla; so that the foundations of the theatre were shaken by their voice. And Tryph&aelig;na having received the good news, went to meet the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Thecla, and said: Now I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the dead are raised: now I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that my child lives. Come within, and I shall assign to you all that is mine. She therefore went in along with her, and rested eight days, having instructed her in the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that most even of the maid-servants <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. And there was great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the house.</p>

<p>And Thecla kept seeking <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; and it was told her that he was in Myra of Lycia. And taking young men and maidens, she girded herself; and having sewed the tunic so as to make a man's cloak, she came to Myra, and found <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> speaking the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was astonished at seeing her, and the crowd with her, thinking that some new trial was coming upon her. And when she saw him, she said: I have received the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; for He that wrought along with you for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> has wrought in me also for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, taking her, led her to the house of Herm&aelig;us, and hears everything from her, so that those that heard greatly wondered, and were comforted, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> over Tryph&aelig;na. And she rose up, and said: I am going to Iconium. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: Go, and teach the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And Tryph&aelig;na sent her much clothing and gold, so that she left to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> many things for the service of the poor.</p>

<p>And she went to Iconium. And she goes into the house of Onesiphorus, and fell upon the pavement where <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> used to sit and teach her, and wept, saying: God of myself and of this house, where you made the light to shine upon me, O Christ Jesus, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my help in the fire, my help among the wild beasts, You are <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. And she found Thamyris dead, but her mother alive. And having sent for her mother, she said: Theocleia, my mother, can you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Lord lives in the heavens? For whether you desire <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, God gives it to you through me; or your child, I am standing beside you. And having thus testified, she departed to Seleucia, and dwelt in a cave seventy-two years, living upon herbs and water. And she enlightened many by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>And certain men of the city, being Greeks by religion, and physicians by profession, sent to her insolent young men to destroy  her. For they said: She is a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and serves Artemis, and from this she has <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in healing. And by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God she entered into the rock alive, and went under ground. And she departed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to see <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and found that he had fallen asleep.  And after staying there no long time, she rested in a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> sleep; and she is buried about two or three stadia from the tomb of her master <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.</p>

<p>She was cast, then, into the fire when seventeen years old, and among the wild beasts when eighteen. And she was an <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> in the cave, as has been said, seventy-two years, so that all the years of her life were ninety. And having accomplished many cures, she rests in the place of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, having fallen asleep on the twenty-fourth of the month of September in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and strength for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of the last two sections, the ms. which Dr. Grabe used has the following:&mdash; </p>

<p>And a cloud of light guided her. And having come into Seleucia, she went forth outside of the city one stadium. And she was afraid of them also, for they worshipped <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. And it guided her to the mountain called Calamon or Rhodeon; and having there found a cave, she went into it. And she was there many years, and underwent many and grievous trials by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and bore them nobly, being assisted by Christ. And some of the well-born <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, having learned about the virgin Thecla, went to her, and learned the oracles of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And many of them bade adieu to the world, and lived an <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> life with her. And a good report was spread everywhere concerning her, and cures were done by her. All the city, therefore, and country round, having <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> this, brought their sick to the mountain; and before they came near the door they were speedily released from whatever disease they were afflicted by; and the unclean spirits went out shrieking, and all received their own in health, glorifying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who had given such <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the virgin Thecla. The physicians, therefore, of the city of the Seleucians were thought nothing of, having lost their trade, and no one any longer had regard to them; and being filled with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, they plotted against the servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, what they should do to her. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> then suggests to them a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> device; and one day, being assembled, and having taken counsel, they consult with each other, saying: This virgin is a priestess of the great goddess Artemis; and if she ask anything of her, she hears her as being a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and all the gods <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> her. Come, then, let us take men of disorderly lives, and make them drunk with much wine, and let us give them much gold, and say to them, If you can corrupt and defile her, we shall give you even more money. The physicians therefore said to themselves, that if they should be able to defile her, neither the gods nor Artemis would listen to her in the case of the sick. They therefore did so. And the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, having gone to the mountain, and rushed upon the cave like lions, knocked at the door. And the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Thecla opened, emboldened by the God in whom she <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; for she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of their plot beforehand. And she says to them: What do you want, my children? And they said: Is there one here called Thecla? And she said: What do you want with her? They say to her: We want to sleep with her. The blessed Thecla says to them: I am a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but the servant of my Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; and even though you want to do something to me out of place, you cannot. They say to her: It is impossible for us not to do to you what we want. And having said this, they laid fast hold of her, and wished to insult her. And she says to them with mildness: Wait, my children, that you may see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord. And being laid hold of by them, she looked up into heaven, and said: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, terrible and incomparable, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> to Your adversaries, who delivered me out of the fire, who did not give me up to Thamyris, who did not give me up to Alexander, who delivered me from the wild beasts, who saved me in the abyss, who hast everywhere worked with me, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Your name in me, now also deliver me from these lawless men, and let me not insult my <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, which through Your name I have preserved till now, because I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> You, and desire You, and adore You, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. And there came a voice out of the heaven, saying: Fear not, Thecla, my <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> servant, for I am with you. Look and see where an opening has been made before you, for there shall be for you an everlasting house, and there you shall obtain shelter. And the blessed Thecla regarding it, saw the rock opened as far as to allow a man to enter, and did according to what had been said to her: and nobly fleeing from the lawless ones entered into the rock; and the rock was straightway shut together, so that not even a joining appeared. And they, beholding the extraordinary wonder, became as it were distracted; and they were not able to detain the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but only caught hold of her veil, and were able to tear off a certain part; and that by the permission of God for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of those seeing the venerable place, and for a blessing in the generations afterwards to those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> out of a pure heart.</p>

<p>Thus, then, suffered the first <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and apostle, and virgin, Thecla, who came from Iconium at eighteen years old; and with the journeying, and the going round, and the retirement in the mountain, she lived other seventy-two years. And when the Lord took her, she was ninety years old. And thus is her consummation. And her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> commemoration is on the twenty-fourth of the month of September, to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, now and ever, and to ages of ages. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
