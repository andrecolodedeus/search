<h1>The Acts of Peter and Paul</h1>

<p>It came to pass, after <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> went out of the island Gaudomeleta,  that he came to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; and it was heard of by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who were in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the elder of the cities, that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> demanded to come to C&aelig;sar. Having fallen, therefore, into great grief and much despondency, they said among themselves: It does not please him that he alone has afflicted all our brethren and <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in Jud&aelig;a and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and in all Palestine; and he has not been pleased with these, but, behold, he comes here also, having through imposition asked C&aelig;sar to destroy us.</p>

<p>Having therefore made an assembly against <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and having considered many proposals,  it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to them to go to <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> the emperor, <em>to ask him</em> not to allow <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Having therefore got in readiness not a few presents, and having carried them with them, with supplication they came before him, saying: We beseech you, O good emperor, send orders into all the governments of your worship, to the effect that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is not to come near these parts; because this <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, having afflicted all the nation of our fathers, has been seeking to come hither to destroy us also. And the affliction, O most worshipful emperor, which we have from Peter is enough for us.</p>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Emperor Nero</a>, having heard these things, answered them: It is  according to your wish. And we write to all our governments that he shall not on any account come to anchor in the parts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. And they also informed Simon the Magian, having sent for him, that, as has been said, he should not come into the parts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.</p>

<p>And while they were thus doing, some of those that had repented out of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and that had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at the preaching of Peter, sent elders to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> with a letter to the following effect: <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, dear servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and brother of Peter, the first of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, we have heard from the rabbis of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that are in this Rome, the greatest of the cities, that they have asked C&aelig;sar to send into all his governments, in order that, wherever you may be found, you may be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. But we have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and do <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that as God does not separate the two great lights which He has made, so He is not to part you from each other, that is, neither Peter from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> from Peter; but we positively <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, into whom we have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that we have become worthy also of your teaching.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, having received the two men sent with the letter on the twentieth of the month of May, became eager <em>to go</em>, and gave thanks to the Lord and Master <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. And having sailed from Gaudomeleta, he did not now come through Africa to the parts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but ran to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, until he came to the city of Syracuse with the two men who had been sent from Rome to him. And having sailed thence, he came to Rhegium of Calabria, and from Rhegium he crossed to Mesina, and there ordained a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Bacchylus by name. And when he came out of Mesina he sailed to Didymus, and remained there one night. And having sailed thence, he came to Pontiole  on the second day.</p>

<p>And Dioscorus the shipmaster, who brought him to Syracuse, sympathizing with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> because he had delivered his son from death, having left his own ship in Syracuse, accompanied him to Pontiole. And some of Peter's <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> having been found there, and having received <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, exhorted him to stay with them. And he stayed a week, in hiding, because of the command of C&aelig;sar. And all the toparchs were watching to seize and kill him. But Dioscorus the shipmaster, being himself also bald, wearing his shipmaster's dress, and speaking boldly, on the first day went out into the city of Pontiole. Thinking therefore that he was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, they seized him, and beheaded him, and sent his head to C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar therefore, having summoned the first men of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, announced to them, saying: Rejoice with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> your enemy is dead. And he showed them the head. Having  therefore made great rejoicing on that day, which was the fourteenth of the month of June, each of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> fully <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, being in Pontiole, and having heard that Dioscorus had been beheaded, being grieved with great grief, gazing into the height of the heaven, said: O Lord Almighty in heaven, who hast appeared to me in every place whither I have gone on account of Your only-begotten Word, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, punish this city, and bring out all who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in God and followed His word. He said to them therefore: Follow me: And going forth from Pontiole with those who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they came to a place called Baias;  and looking up with their eyes, they all see that city called Pontiole sunk into the sea-shore about one fathom; and there it is until this day, for a remembrance, under the sea.</p>

<p>And having gone forth from Baias, they went to Gaitas, and there he taught the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And he stayed there three days in the house of Erasmus, whom Peter sent from Rome to teach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And having come forth from Gaitas, he came to the castle called Taracinas, and stayed there seven days in the house of C&aelig;sarius the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, whom Peter had ordained by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a>. And sailing thence, he came by the river to a place called Tribus Tabernes.</p>

<p>And those who had been saved out of the city of Pontiole that had been swallowed up, reported to C&aelig;sar in Rome that Pontiole had been swallowed up, with all its multitude. And the emperor, being in great grief on account of the city, having summoned the chief of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, said to them: Behold, on account of what I heard from you, I have caused <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to be beheaded, and on account of this the city has been swallowed up. And the chief of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said to C&aelig;sar: Most worshipful emperor, did we not say to you that he troubled all the country of the East, and perverted our fathers? It is better therefore, most worshipful emperor, that one city be destroyed, and not the seat of your empire; for this had Rome to suffer. And the emperor, having heard their words, was appeased.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> stayed in Tribus Tabernes four days. And departing thence, he came to Appii Forum, which is called Vicusarape; and having slept there that night, he saw one sitting on a golden chair, and a multitude of blacks standing beside him, saying: I have today made a son <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> his father. Another said: And I have made a house fall, and kill <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> with children. And they reported to him many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>&mdash; some of one kind, some of another. And another coming, reported to him: I have managed that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Juvenalius, whom Peter ordained, should sleep with the abbess Juliana. And having heard all these things when sleeping in that Appii Forum, near Vicusarape, straightway and immediately he sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> one of those who had followed him from Pontiole to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Juvenalius, telling him this same thing which had just been done. And on the following day, Juvenalius, running, threw himself at the feet of Peter, weeping and lamenting, and saying what had just befallen; and he recounted to him the matter, and said: I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that this is the light which you were awaiting. And Peter said to him: How is it possible that it is he when he is dead? And Juvenalius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> took to Peter him that had been sent by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and he reported to him that he was alive, and on his way, and that he was at Appii Forum. And Peter thanked and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the God and Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p>Then having summoned his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, he sent them to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> as far as Tribus Tabernes. And the distance from Rome to Tribus Tabernes is thirty-eight miles.  And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> seeing them, having given thanks to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, took <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>; and departing thence, they slept in the city called Aricia.</p>

<p>And a report went about in the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the brother of Peter was coming. And those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in God rejoiced with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. And there was great consternation among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and having gone to Simon the Magian, they entreated him, saying: Report to the emperor that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is not dead, but that he is alive, and has come. And Simon said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: What head is it, then, which came to C&aelig;sar from Pontiole? Was it not bald also?</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> having come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> fell upon the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. They came together therefore to him, and exhorted him, saying: Vindicate the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in which you were born; for it is not right that you, being a Hebrew, and of the Hebrews, should call yourself teacher of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and vindicator of the uncircumcised; and, being yourself <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, that you should bring to nought the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>.  And when you see Peter, contend against his teaching, because he has destroyed all the bulwarks of our law; for he has prevented the keeping of <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a> and new moons, and the holidays appointed by the law. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, answering, said to them: That I am a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Jew, by this you can prove; because also you have been able to keep the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and to observe the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; for assuredly on the day of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> God rested from all His works. We have fathers, and patriarchs, and the law. What, then, does Peter preach in the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>? But if he shall wish to bring in any new teaching, without any tumult, and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and trouble, send him word, that we may see, and in your presence I shall convict him. But if his teaching be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, supported by the book and testimony of the Hebrews, it becomes all of us to submit to him.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> saying these and such like things, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> went and said to Peter: <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> of the Hebrews has come, and entreats you to come to him, since those who have brought him say that he cannot meet whomsoever he may wish until he appear before C&aelig;sar. And Peter having heard, rejoiced with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; and rising up, immediately went to him. And seeing each other, they wept for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; and long embracing each other, they bedewed each other with tears.</p>

<p>And when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had related to Peter the substance  of all his doings, and how, through the disasters of the ship, he had come, Peter also told him what he had suffered from Simon the Magian, and all his plots. And having told these things, he went away towards evening.</p>

<p>And in the morning of the following day, at dawn, behold, Peter coming, finds a multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> before <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> door. And there was a great uproar between the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For, on the one hand, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said: We are a chosen race, a royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, the friends of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, with whom God spoke, to whom He showed His own <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> and His great wonders. But you of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are no great thing in your lineage; if otherwise, you have become polluted and abominable by <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and graven images.</p>

<p>While the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were saying such things, and such-like, those of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> answered, saying: We, when we heard the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, straightway followed it, having abandoned our <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. But you, both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the mighty <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of your fathers, and seeing the signs of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and having received the law, and gone through the sea with dry feet, and seen your enemies sunk in its depths, and the pillar of fire by night and of cloud by day shining upon you, and manna having been given to you out of heaven, and water flowing to you out of a rock&mdash;after all these things you fashioned to yourselves the idol of a calf, and worshipped the graven image. But we, having seen none of the signs, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be a Saviour the God whom you have forsaken in unbelief.</p>

<p>While they were contending in these and such-like words, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> said that they ought not to make such attacks upon each other, but that they should rather give heed to this, that God had fulfilled His promises which He swore to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> our father, that in his seed he should inherit all the nations.  For there is no respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  As many as have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in law shall be judged according to law, and as many as have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> without law shall perish without law. <span class="stiki" id="note082069"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;2:12</a></span> But we, brethren, ought to thank God that, according to His mercy, He has chosen us to be a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people to Himself: so that in this we ought to boast, whether <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or Greeks; for you are all one in the belief of His name.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> having thus spoken, both the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and they of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were appeased. But the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> assailed Peter. And Peter, when they accused him of having renounced their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, said: Hear, brethren, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Spirit about the patriarch David, promising, Of the fruit of your womb shall He set upon your throne.  Him therefore to whom the Father said, You are my Son, this day have I begotten You, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> crucified; but that He might accomplish the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the world, it was allowed that He should suffer all these things.  Just as, therefore, from the side of Adam Eve was created, so also from the side of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was created the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which has no spot nor blemish. In Him,  therefore, God has opened an entrance to all the sons of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, in order that they may be in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of profession towards Him,  and have life and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in His name. Turn, therefore, and enter into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of your father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, because God has fulfilled what He promised to him. Whence also the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, The Lord has <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a>, and will not repent: You are a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever, after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedec</a>.  For a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> He became upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, when He offered the whole burnt-offering of His own body and blood as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for all the world.</p>

<p>And Peter saying this and such-like, the most part of the people <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. And it happened also that <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> wife Libia, and the yoke-fellow of Agrippa the prefect, Agrippina by name, thus <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, so that also they went away from beside their own husbands. And on account of the teaching of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, many, despising military life, clung to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so that even from the emperor's bed-chamber some came to him, and having become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, were no longer willing to return to the army or the palace.</p>

<p>When, consequently, the people were making a seditious murmuring, Simon, moved with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, rouses himself, and began to say many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things about Peter, saying that he was a wizard and a cheat. And they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him, wondering at his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; for he made a brazen serpent move itself, and stone <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> to laugh and move themselves, and himself to run and suddenly to be raised into the air. But as a set-off to these, Peter healed the sick by a word, by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> made the blind to see, put <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> to flight by a command; sometimes he even raised the dead. And he said to the people that they should not only flee from Simon's deceit, but also that they should expose him, that they might not seem to be slaves to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<p>And thus it happened that all <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men abhorred Simon the Magian, and proclaimed him impious. But those who adhered to Simon strongly affirmed Peter to be a magian, bearing false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> as many of them as were with Simon the Magian; so that the matter came even to the ears of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> the C&aelig;sar, and he gave order to bring Simon the Magian before him. And he, coming in, stood before him, and began suddenly to assume different forms, so that on a sudden he became a child, and after a little an old man, and at other times a young man; for he changed himself both in face and stature into different forms, and was in a frenzy, having the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> as his servant. And <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> beholding this, supposed him to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>; but the Apostle Peter showed him to be both a liar and a wizard, base and impious and <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, and in all things opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that nothing yet remained except that his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, being made apparent by the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, might be made manifest to them all.</p>

<p>Then Simon, having gone in to <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, said: Hear, O good emperor: I am the son of God come down from heaven. Until now I have endured Peter only calling himself an apostle; but now he has doubled the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also himself teaches the same things, and having his mind turned against me, is said to preach along with him; in reference to whom, if you shall not contrive their destruction, it is very plain that your kingdom cannot stand.</p>

<p>Then <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, filled with concern, ordered to bring them speedily before him. And on the following day Simon the Magian, and Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, having come in to <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, Simon said: These are the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Nazarene, and it is not at all well that they should be of the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: What is a Nazarene? Simon said: There is a city of Judah which has always been opposed to us, called <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, and to it the teacher of these men belonged. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: God commands us to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> every man; why, then, do you <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> them? Simon said: This is a race of men who have turned aside all Jud&aelig;a from believing in me. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said to Peter: Why are you thus unbelieving, according to your race?  Then Peter said to Simon: You have been able to impose upon all, but upon me never; and those who have been deceived, God has through me recalled from their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. And since you have learned by experience that you can not get the better of me, I wonder with what face you boast yourself before the emperor, and supposest that through your magic art you shall overcome the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: Who is Christ? Peter said: He is what this Simon the Magian affirms himself to be; but this is a most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man, and his works are of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. But if you wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O good emperor, the things that have been done in Jud&aelig;a about Christ, take the writings of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> sent to Claudius, and thus you will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all. And <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> ordered them to be brought, and to be read in their presence; and they were to the following effect: &mdash; </p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> to Claudius, greeting. There has lately happened an event which I myself was concerned in. For the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> have inflicted on themselves, and those coming after them, dreadful judgments. Their fathers had promises that their God would send them his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> one from heaven, who according to reason should be called their king, and he had promised to send him to the earth by means of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. He, then, when I was <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, came into Jud&aelig;a. And they saw  him enlightening the blind, cleansing <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, healing paralytics, expelling <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> from men, raising the dead, subduing the winds, walking upon the waves of the sea, and doing many other wonders, and all the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> calling him <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Then the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, moved with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> against him, seized him, and delivered him to me; and telling one lie after another, they said that he was a wizard, and did contrary to their law. And I, having <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that these things were so, gave him up, after scourging him, to their will;  and they crucified him, and after he was buried set guards over him. But he, while my soldiers were guarding him, rose on the third day. And to such a degree was the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> inflamed against him, that they gave money to the soldiers, saying, Say his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> have stolen his body. But they, having taken the money, were not able to keep silence as to what had happened; for they have testified that they have seen him (after he was) risen, and that they have received money from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. These things, therefore, have I reported, that no one should <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> speak otherwise, and that you should not suppose that the falsehoods of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</p>

<p>And the letter having been read, <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: Tell me, Peter, were all these things thus done by him? Peter said: They were, with your permission, O good emperor. For this Simon is full of lies and deceit, even if it should seem that he is what he is not&mdash; a god. And in Christ there is all excellent victory through God and through man,  which that incomprehensible <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> assumed which through man deigned to come to the assistance of men. But in this Simon there are two essences, of man and of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who through man endeavours to ensnare men.</p>

<p>Simon said: I wonder, O good emperor, that you reckon this man of any consequence&mdash; a man uneducated, a fisherman of the poorest, and endowed with power neither in word nor by rank. But, that I may not long endure him as an enemy, I shall immediately order my <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to come and avenge me upon him. Peter said: I am not afraid of your <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; but they shall be much more afraid of me in the power and trust of my Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom you <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> declarest yourself to be.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: Are you not afraid, Peter, of Simon, who confirms his godhead by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>? Peter said: Godhead is in Him who searches the hidden things of the heart.  Now then, tell me what I am thinking about, or what I am doing. I disclose to your servants who are here what my thought is, before he tells lies about it, in order that he may not dare to lie as to what I am thinking about. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: Come hither, and tell me what you are thinking about. Peter said: Order a barley loaf to be brought, and to be given to me secretly. And when he ordered it to be brought, and secretly given to Peter, Peter said: Now tell us, Simon, what has been thought about, or what said, or what done.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: Do you mean me to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Simon does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these things, who both raised a dead man, and presented himself on the third day after he had been beheaded, and who has done whatever he said he would do? Peter said: But he did not do it before me. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: But he did all these before me. For assuredly he ordered <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to come to him, and they came. Peter said: If he has done what is very great, why does he not do what is very small? Let him tell what I had in my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and what I have done. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: Between you, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> myself. Simon said: Let Peter say what I am thinking of, or what I am doing. Peter said: What Simon has in his mind I shall show that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, by my doing what he is thinking about. Simon said: Know this, O emperor, that no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the thoughts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but God alone. Is not, therefore, Peter lying? Peter said: you, then, who sayest that you are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, tell what I have in my mind; disclose, if you can, what I have just done in secret. For Peter, having blessed the barley loaf which he had received, and hawing broken it with his right hand and his left, had heaped it up in his sleeves. Then Simon, enraged that he was not able to tell the secret of the apostle, cried out, saying: Let great dogs come forth, and eat him up before C&aelig;sar. And suddenly there appeared great dogs, and rushed at Peter. But Peter, stretching forth his hands  to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, showed to the dogs the loaf which he had blessed; which the dogs seeing, no longer appeared. Then Peter said to <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>: Behold, I have shown you that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what Simon was thinking of, not by words, but by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; for he, having promised that he would bring <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> against me, has brought dogs, in order that he might show that he had not god-like but dog-like <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<p>Then <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said to Simon: What is it, Simon? I think we have got the worst of it. Simon said: This man, both in Jud&aelig;a and in all Palestine and C&aelig;sarea, has done the same to me;  and from very often striving with me, he has learned that this is adverse to them. This, then, he has learned how to escape from me; for the thoughts of men no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> but God alone. And Peter said to Simon: Certainly you feign yourself to be a god; why, then, do you not reveal the thoughts of every man?</p>

<p>Then <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, turning to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, said: Why do you say nothing, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> answered and said: Know this, O emperor, that if you permit this magician to do such things, it will bring an access of the greatest mischief to your country, and will bring down your empire from its position. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said to Simon: What do you say? Simon said: If I do not manifestly hold myself out to be a god, no one will bestow upon me due reverence. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: And now, why do you delay, and not show yourself to be a god, in order that these men may be punished? Simon said: Give orders to build for me a lofty tower of wood, and I, going up upon it, will call my <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and order them to take me, in the sight of all, to my father in heaven; and these men, not being able to do this, are put to shame as  uneducated men. And <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said to Peter: Have you heard, Peter, what has been said by Simon? From this will appear how much power either he or your god has. Peter said: O most mighty emperor, if you were willing, you might perceive that he is full of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: Why do you make to me roundabouts of circumlocutions? Tomorrow will prove you.</p>

<p>Simon said: Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, O good emperor, that I who was dead, and rose again, am a magician? For it had been brought about by his own cleverness that the unbelieving Simon had said to <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>: Order me to be beheaded in a dark place, and there to be left slain; and if I do not rise on the third day, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am a magician; but if I rise again, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> having ordered this, in the dark, by his magic art he managed that a ram should be beheaded. And for so long did the ram appear to be Simon until he was beheaded. And when he had been beheaded in the dark, he that had beheaded him, taking the head, found it to be that of a ram; but he would not say anything to the emperor, lest he should scourge him, having ordered this to be done in secret. Thereafter, accordingly. Simon said that he had risen on the third day, because he took away the head of the ram and the limbs&mdash; but the blood had been there congealed&mdash; and on the third day he showed himself to <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, and said: Cause to be wiped away my blood that has been poured out; for, behold, having been beheaded, as I promised, I have risen again on the third day.</p>

<p>And when <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said, Tomorrow will prove you, turning to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, he says:  You, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, why do you say nothing? Either who taught you, or whom you have for a master, or how you have taught in the cities, or what things have happened through your teaching? For I think that you have not any wisdom, and art not able to accomplish any work of power. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> answered: Do you suppose that I ought to speak against a desperate man, a magician, who has given his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> up to death, whose destruction and perdition will come speedily? For he ought to speak who pretends to be what he is not, and deceives men by magic art. If you consent to hear his words, and to shield him, you shall destroy your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and your kingdom, for he is a most base man. And as the Egyptians Jannes and Jambres led <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> and his army astray until they were swallowed up in the sea, so also he, through the instruction of his father the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, persuades men to do many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to themselves, and thus deceives many of the innocent, to the peril of your kingdom. But as for the word of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, which I see has been poured out through this man, with groanings of my heart I am dealing with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, that it may be clearly shown what it is; for as far as he seems to raise himself towards heaven, so far will he be sunk down into the depth of Hades, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. But about the teaching of my Master, of which you asked me, none attain it except the pure, who allow <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to come into their heart.  For as many things as belong to peace and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, these have I taught. Round about from Jerusalem, and as far as <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note082085"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;15:19</a></span> I have fulfilled the word of peace. For I have taught that in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> they should prefer one another; <span class="stiki" id="note082086"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;12:10</a></span> I have taught those that are eminent and rich not to be lifted up, and hope in uncertainty of riches, but to place their hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note082087"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:17</a></span> I have taught those in a middle station to be content with food and covering;  I have taught the poor to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in their own poverty; I have taught fathers to teach their children instruction in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, children to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in wholesome admonition;  I have taught wives to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their own husbands, and to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> them as masters, and husbands to observe fidelity to their wives; I have taught masters to treat their slaves with clemency, and slaves to serve their own masters faithfully; <span class="stiki" id="note082090"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse18">Colossians&nbsp;3:18-22</a></span> I have taught the churches of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> to reverence one almighty, invisible, and incomprehensible God. And this teaching has been given me, not from men, nor through men, but through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note082091"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;1:1</a></span> who spoke to me out of heaven, who also has sent me to preach, saying to me, Go forth, for I will be with you; and all things, as many as you shall say or do, I shall make just.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: What do you say, Peter? He answered and said: All that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> has said is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.  For when he was a persecutor of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, a voice called him out of heaven, and taught him the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for he was not an adversary of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, but from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. For there were before us false Christs, like Simon, false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, who, contrary to the sacred writings, set themselves to make void the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and against these it was necessary to have in readiness this man, who from his youth up set himself to no other thing than to search out the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the divine law, by which  he might become a vindicator of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and a persecutor of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. Since, then, his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was not on account of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, but on account of the vindication of the law, the very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> out of heaven held intercourse with him, saying, I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which you persecutest; cease persecuting  me. When, therefore, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that this was so, leaving off that which he was vindicating, he began to vindicate this way of Christ which he was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a>.</p>

<p>Simon said: O good emperor, take notice that these two have conspired against me; for I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and they purpose <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against me. Peter said: There is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in you; but all you say is false.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, what do you say? <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: Those things which you have heard from Peter, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to have been spoken by me also; for we purpose the same thing, for we have the same Lord Jesus the Christ. Simon said: Do you expect me, O good emperor, to hold an argument with these men, who have come to an agreement against me? And having turned to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he said: Listen, Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: if I can do nothing for you here, we are going to the place where I must judge you. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: O good emperor, see what threats he holds out against us. Peter said: Why was it necessary to keep from laughing outright at a foolish man, made the sport of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, so as to suppose that he cannot be made manifest?</p>

<p>Simon said: I spare you until I shall receive my power. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: See if you will go out hence safe. Peter said: If you do not see, Simon, the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> yourself not to be Christ. Simon said: Most sacred emperor, do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, for they are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> knaves. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: Before we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we had the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the flesh; but when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> appeared, in the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the heart we both are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, and circumcise. Peter said: If <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> be a disgrace, why have you been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, Simon?</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: Has, then, Simon also been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>? Peter said: For not otherwise could he have deceived <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, unless he feigned himself to be a Jew, and made a show of teaching the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: Simon, you, as I see, being carried away with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, persecutest these men. For, as it seems, there is great <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> between you and their Christ; and I am afraid that you will be worsted by them, and involved in great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Simon said: You are led astray, O emperor. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: How am I led astray? What I see in you, I say. I see that you are manifestly an enemy of Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and their master.</p>

<p>Simon said: Christ was not <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> master. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: Yes; through revelation He taught me also. But tell me what I asked you&mdash; Why were you <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>? Simon said: Why have you asked me this? <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: We have a reason for asking you this. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: Why are you afraid to answer them? Simon said: Listen, O emperor. At that time <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was enjoined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> when I received it. For this reason was I <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: Do you hear, O good emperor, what has been said by Simon? If, therefore, <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> be a good thing, why have you, Simon, given up those who have been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, and forced them, after being condemned, to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>? <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: Neither about you do I perceive anything good. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: Whether this thought about us be good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has no reference to the matter; but to us it was necessary that what our Master promised should come to pass. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: If I should not be willing? Peter said: Not as you will, but as He promised to us.</p>

<p>Simon said: O good emperor, these men have reckoned upon your clemency, and have bound you. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: But neither have you yet made me sure about yourself. Simon said: Since so many excellent <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and signs have been shown to you by me, I wonder how you should be in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: I neither <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> nor favour any of you; but answer me rather what I ask.</p>

<p>Simon said: Henceforward I answer you nothing. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: Seeing that you lie, therefore you say this. But if even I can do nothing to you, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who can, will do it. Simon said: I no longer answer you. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: Nor do I consider you to be anything: for, as I perceive, you are a liar in everything. But why do I say so much? The three of you show that your reasoning is uncertain; and thus in all things you have made me <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, so that I find that I can give credit to none of you. </p>

<p>Peter said: We preach one God and Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, that has made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that therein is, who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> King; and of His kingdom there shall be no end. <span class="stiki" id="note082095"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;1:33</a></span> <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: What king is lord? <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: The Saviour of all the nations. Simon said: I am he whom you speak of. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: May it never be well with you, Simon, magician, and full of bitterness.</p>

<p>Simon said: Listen, O C&aelig;sar <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that these men are liars, and that I have been sent from the heavens: tomorrow I go up into the heavens, that I may make those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me blessed, and show my <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> upon those who have denied me. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: Us long ago God called to His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; but you, called by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, hastenest to punishment. Simon said: C&aelig;sar <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, listen to me. Separate these madmen from you, in order that when I go into heaven to my father, I may be very merciful to you. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: And whence shall we prove this, that you go away into heaven? Simon said: Order a lofty tower to be made of wood, and of great beams, that I may go up upon it, and that my <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> may find me in the air; for they cannot come to me upon earth among the sinners. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: I will see whether you will fulfil what you say.</p>

<p>Then <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> ordered a lofty tower to be made in the Campus Martius, and all the people and the dignities to be present at the spectacle. And on the following day, all the multitude having come together, <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> ordered Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to be present, to whom also he said: Now the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has to be made manifest. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: We do not expose him, but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, whom he has <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> declared himself to be.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, having turned to Peter, said: It is my part to bend the knee, and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and yours to produce the effect, if you should see him attempting anything, because you were first taken in hand  by the Lord. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, bending his knees, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>. And Peter, looking steadfastly upon Simon, said: Accomplish what you have begun; for both your exposure and our call is at hand: for I see my Christ calling both me and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: And where will you go to against my will? Peter said: Whithersoever our Lord has called us. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: And who is your lord? Peter said: Jesus the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, whom I see calling us to Himself. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: Do you also then intend to go away to heaven? Peter said: If it shall seem good to Him that calls us. Simon said: In order that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O emperor, that these are deceivers, as soon as ever I ascend into heaven, I will send my <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to you, and will make you come to me. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: Do at once what you say.</p>

<p>Then Simon went up upon the tower in the face of all, and, crowned with laurels, he stretched forth his hands, and began to fly. And when <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> saw him flying, he said to Peter: This Simon is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but you and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> are deceivers. To whom Peter said: Immediately shall you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Christ; but that he is not Christ, but a magician, and a malefactor. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: Do you still persist? Behold, you see him going up into heaven. Then Peter, looking steadfastly upon <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, said: <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, look up and see. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, having looked up, full of tears, and seeing Simon flying, said: Peter, why are you idle? Finish what you have begun; for already <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is calling us. And <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> hearing them, smiled a little, and said: These men see themselves worsted already, and are gone mad. Peter said: Now you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we are not mad. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said to Peter: Do at once what you do.</p>

<p>And Peter, looking steadfastly against Simon, said: I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> you, you <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, who are carrying him into the air, to deceive the hearts of the unbelievers, by the God that created all things, and by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom on the third day He raised from the dead, no longer from this hour to keep him up, but to let him go. And immediately, being let go, he fell into a place called Sacra Via, that is, Holy Way, and was divided into four parts, having perished by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>.</p>

<p>Then <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> ordered Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to be put in irons, and the body of Simon to be carefully kept three days, thinking that he would rise on the third day. To whom Peter said: He will no longer rise, since he is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> dead, being condemned to everlasting punishment. And <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said to him: Who commanded you to do such a dreadful deed? Peter said: His reflections and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against my Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> have brought him into this gulf of destruction. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: I will destroy you by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> taking off. Peter said: This is not in your power, even if it should seem good to you to destroy us; but it is necessary that what our Master promised to us should be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Then <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, having summoned Agrippa the propr&aelig;tor, said to him: It is necessary that men introducing mischievous religious observances should die. Wherefore I order them to take iron clubs,  and to be killed in the sea-fight. Agrippa the propr&aelig;tor said: Most sacred emperor, what you have ordered is not fitting for these men, since <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> seems innocent beside Peter. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: By what <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, then, shall they die? Agrippa answered and said: As seems to me, it is just that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> head should be cut off, and that Peter should be raised on a cross as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> said: You have most excellently judged.</p>

<p>Then both Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> were led away from the presence of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was beheaded on the Ostesian road. </p>

<p>And Peter, having come to the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, said: Since my Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who came down from the heaven upon the earth, was raised upon the cross upright,  and He has deigned to call to heaven me, who am of the earth, my cross ought to be fixed head down most, so as to direct my feet towards heaven; for I am not worthy to be crucified like my Lord. Then, having reversed the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, they nailed his feet up.</p>

<p>And the multitude was assembled reviling C&aelig;sar, and wishing to kill him. But Peter restrained them, saying:  A few days ago, being exhorted by the brethren, I was going away; and my Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> met me, and having adored Him, I said, Lord, whither are You going? And He said to me, I am going to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to be crucified. And I said to Him, Lord, were You not crucified once for all? And the Lord answering, said, I saw you fleeing from death, and I wish to be crucified instead of you. And I said, Lord, I go; I fulfil Your command. And He said to me, Fear not, for I am with you.  On this account, then, children, do not hinder my going; for already my feet are going on the road to heaven. Do not grieve, therefore, but rather <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with me, for today I receive the fruit of my labours. And thus speaking, he said: I thank You, good Shepherd, that the sheep which You have entrusted to me, sympathize with me; I ask, then, that with me they may have a part in Your kingdom.  And having thus spoken, he gave up the ghost.</p>

<p>And immediately there appeared men <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and strange in appearance; and they said: We are here, on account of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and chief <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, from Jerusalem. And they, along with Marcellus, an illustrious man, who, having left Simon, had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Peter, took up his body secretly, and put it under the terebinth near the place for the exhibition of sea-fights in the place called the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican</a>. </p>

<p>And the men who had said that they came from Jerusalem said to the people: Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, because you have been deemed worthy to have great champions. And <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> himself, after these not many days, will be utterly destroyed, and his kingdom shall be given to another.</p>

<p>And after these things the people revolted against him; and when he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of it, he fled into desert places, and through hunger and cold he gave up the ghost, and his body became food for the wild beasts.</p>

<p>And some devout men of the regions of the East wished to carry off the relics of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and immediately there was a great earthquake in the city;  and those that dwelt in the city having become aware of it, ran and seized the men, but they fled. But the Romans having taken them, put them in a place three miles from the city, and there they were guarded a year and seven months, until they had built the place in which they intended to put them. And after these things, all having assembled with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and singing of praise, they put them in the place built for them.</p>

<p>And the consummation of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Apostles Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was on the 29th of the month of June&mdash; in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and strength.</p>

<h2>The Story of Perpetua</h2>

<p>And as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was being led away to be beheaded at a place about three miles from the city, he was in irons. And there were three soldiers guarding him who were of a great <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. And when they had gone out of the gate about the length of a bow-shot, there met them a God-fearing <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; and she, seeing <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> dragged along in irons, had compassion on him, and wept bitterly. And the name of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was called Perpetua; and she was one-eyed. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, seeing her weeping, says to her: Give me your handkerchief, and when I turn back I shall give it to you. And she, having taken the handkerchief, gave it to him willingly. And the soldiers laughed, and said to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: Why do you wish, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, to lose your handkerchief? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> that he is going away to be beheaded? And Perpetua said to them: I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> you by the health of C&aelig;sar to bind his eyes with this handkerchief when you cut off his head. Which also was done. And they beheaded him at the place called Aqu&aelig; Salvi&aelig;, near the pine tree. And as God had willed, before the soldiers came back, the handkerchief, having on it drops of blood, was restored to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. And as she was carrying it, straightway and immediately her eye was opened.</p>

<p>And the three soldiers who had cut off the head of Saint <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, when after three hours they came on the same day with the Bulla bringing it to <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, having met Perpetua, they said to her: What is it, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? Behold, by your confidence you have lost your handkerchief. But she said to them: I have both got my handkerchief, and my eye has recovered its sight. And as the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, lives, I also have entreated him that I may be deemed worthy to become the slave of his Lord. Then the soldiers who had the Bulla, recognising the handkerchief, and seeing that her eye had been opened, cried out with a loud voice, as if from one mouth, and said: We too are the slaves of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> master. Perpetua therefore having gone away, reported in the palace of the <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Emperor Nero</a> that the soldiers who had beheaded <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said: We shall no longer go into the city, for we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> preached, and we are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Then <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, filled with rage, ordered Perpetua, who had informed him of the soldiers, to be kept fast in irons; and as to the soldiers, he ordered one to be beheaded outside of the gate about one mile from the city, another to be cut in two, and the third to be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>. And Perpetua was in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; and in this <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> there was kept Potentiana, a noble maiden, because she had said: I forsake my <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and all the substance of my father, and I wish to become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. She therefore joined herself to Perpetua, and ascertained from her everything about <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and was in much anxiety about the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And the wife of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> was Potentiana's sister; and she secretly informed her about Christ, that those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him see everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and that everything here is temporary, but there <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>: so that also she fled out of the palace, and some of the senators' wives with her. Then <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, having inflicted many tortures upon Perpetua, at last tied a great stone to her neck, and ordered her to be thrown over a precipice. And her remains lie at the Momentan  gate. And Potentiana also underwent many torments; and at last, having made a furnace one day, they burned her.</p>
