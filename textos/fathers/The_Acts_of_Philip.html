<h1>The Acts of Philip</h1>

<h2>Of the Journeyings of Philip the Apostle, From the Fifteenth Acts Until the End, and Among Them the Martyrdom.</h2>

<p>About the time when the <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Emperor Trajan</a> received the government of the Romans, after Simon the son of Clopas, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Jerusalem, had suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in the eighth year of his reign, being the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church there after James who bore the name of <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>,  Philip the apostle, going through the cities and regions of Lydia and Asia, preached to all the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>And having come to the city of Ophioryma, which is called Hierapolis of Asia, he was entertained by a certain believer, Stachys by name. And there was with him also Bartholomew, one of the seventy <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Lord, and his sister Mariamme, and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that followed him. All the men of the city therefore, having left their work, ran to the house of Stachys, hearing about the works which Philip did. And many men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> having assembled in the house of Stachys, Philip along with Bartholomew taught them the things of Jesus.</p>

<p>And Philip's sister Mariamme, sitting in the entry of the house of Stachys, addressed herself to those coming, persuading them to listen to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, saying to them: Our brethren, and sons of my Father in heaven, you are the excellent riches, and the substance of the city above, the delight of the habitation which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has prepared for those that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him. Trample under foot the snares of the enemy, the writhing serpent. For his path is crooked, since he is the son of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one, and the poison of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is in him; and his father is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, the author of death, and his mother corruption; rage in his eyes and destruction in his mouth, and his path is Hades. Wherefore flee from him that has no substance, the shapeless one that has no shape in all the creation, whether in the heaven or in the earth, whether in the flying creatures or the beasts. For everything is taken away from his shape; for among the beasts of the earth and the fowls of the heaven is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of him, that the serpent trails his belly and his breast; and Tartarus is his dwelling-place, and he goes in the darkness, since he has confidence in nothing.  Flee therefore from him, that his poison may not be poured out into your mouth. But be rather believing, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, of good works, having no deceit. Take away from yourselves the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> disposition, that is, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires through which the serpent, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> dragon, the prince of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, has produced the pasture of destruction and death for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since all the desire of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> has proceeded from him. And this is the root of iniquity, the maintenance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, the death of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: for the desire of the enemy is armed against the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, and comes forth from the darkness, and walks in the darkness, taking in hand to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with those who are in the light. For this is the beginning of concupiscence.  Wherefore you who wish to come to us, and the rather that God has come through us to you as a father to his own children, wishing to have mercy upon you, and to deliver you from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> snare of the enemy, flee from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the enemy, and cast them completely out of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, hating openly the father of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and loving Jesus, who is light, and life, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the Saviour of all who desire Him. Having run, therefore, to Him, take hold of Him in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that He may bring you up out of the pit of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and having cleansed you, set you blameless, living in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in the presence of His Father.</p>

<p>And all these things Philip said to the multitudes that had come together to worship as in old times the serpents and the viper, of which also they set up images and worshipped them. Wherefore also they called Hierapolis Ophioryma.  And these things having been said by Philip, Bartholomew and Mariamme and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and Stachys being along with him, all the people gave ear, and a great multitude of them fleeing from the enemy were turned to Jesus, and were added to Philip and those about him. And the faithful were the more confirmed in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>And Nicanora, the wife of the proconsul, lying in bed under various diseases, especially of the eyes, having heard about the Apostle Philip and his teaching, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the Lord. For she had even before this heard about Him; and having called upon His name, she was released from the troubles that afflicted her. And rising up, she went forth out of her house through the side door, carried by her own slaves in a silver litter, and went into the house of Stachys, where the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were.</p>

<p>And when she came before the gate of the house, Mariamme, the sister of Philip the apostle, seeing her, spoke to her in the Hebrew tongue before Philip and Bartholomew, and all the multitude of those who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, saying: <span class="sc">Alemakan, ikasame, marmare, nachaman,  mastranan, achaman</span>; which is, Daughter of the father, you are my mistress, you have been given as a pledge to the serpent; but Jesus our Redeemer has come to deliver you through us, to break your bands, and cut them, and to remove them from you from their root, because you are my sister, one mother brought us forth twins. You have forsaken your father, you have forsaken the path leading you to the dwelling-place of your mother, being in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; you have left the temple of that deception, and of the temporary <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and hast come to us, fleeing from the enemy, because he is the dwelling-place of death. Behold, now your Redeemer has come to redeem you; Christ the Sun of righteousness has risen upon you, to enlighten you. <span class="stiki" id="note082164"><a href="../bible/mal004.htm#verse2">Malachi&nbsp;4:2</a></span> </p>

<p>And when Nicanora, standing before the door, heard these things, she took <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> before all, crying out, and saying: I am a Hebrew, and a daughter of the Hebrews; speak with me in the language of my fathers. For, having heard the preaching of my fathers, I was straightway cured of the disease and the troubles that encompassed me. I therefore adore the goodness of God who has caused you to be spoiled even to this city, on account of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> stone  held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, in order that through you we may receive the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him, and may live with you, having <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him.</p>

<p>Nicanora having thus spoken, the Apostle Philip, along with Bartholomew and Mariamme and those with them, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for her to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying:  You who brings   the dead to life, Christ Jesus the Lord, who hast freed us through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> from the slavery of death, <span class="stiki" id="note082166"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;6:3-4</a></span> completely deliver also this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, the enemy; make her alive in Your life, and perfect her in Your perfection, in order that she may be found in the country of her fathers in freedom, having a portion in Your goodness, O Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>And all having sent up the <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a> along with the Apostle Philip, behold, there came the tyrant, the husband of Nicanora, raging like an unbroken horse; and having laid hold of his wife's garments, he cried out, saying: O Nicanora, did not I leave you in bed? How had you so much strength as to come to these magicians? And how have you been cured of the inflammation of your eyes? Now, therefore, unless you tell me who your physician is, and what is his name, I shall punish you with various punishments, and shall not have compassion upon you. And she answering, says to him: O tyrant, cast out from you this tyranny of yours, forsake this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of yours; abandon this life lasting only for a season; run away from the brutality of your worthless disposition; flee from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> dragon and his <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>; throw from you the works and the dart of the man-slaying serpent; renounce the abominable and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, which are the husbandry of the enemy, the hedge of darkness; make for yourself a life chaste and pure, that being in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> you may be able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my Physician, and to get His name. If therefore you wish me to be beside you, prepare yourself to live in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and self-restraint, and in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and I shall live with you all my life; only cleanse yourself from the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and from all their filth.</p>

<p>And when the gloomy tyrant her husband heard these words of hers, he seized her by the hair of her head, and dragged her along, kicking her, and saying: It will be a fine thing for you to be cut off by the sword, or to see you from beside me committing fornication with these foreign magicians; for I see that you have fallen into the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of these deceivers. You first of them, therefore, I shall cut off by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> death; and then, not sparing them, I shall cut their sinews, and put them to a most cruel death. And having turned, he said to those about him: Bring out for me those <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">impostors</a> of magicians. And the public executioners having run into the house of Stachys, and laid hold of the Apostle Philip, and Bartholomew and Mariamme, dragged them along, leading them to where the proconsul was. And the most faithful Stachys followed, and all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.</p>

<p>And the proconsul seeing them, gnashed his teeth, saying: Torture these deceivers that have deceived many <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and young men and girls, saying that they are worshippers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while they are an abomination. And he ordered thongs of raw hide to be brought, and Philip and Bartholomew and Mariamme to be beaten; and after they had been scourged with the thongs, he ordered their feet to be tied, and them to be dragged through the streets of the city as far as the gate of their temple. And a great crowd was assembled, so that scarcely any one stayed at home; and they all wondered at their patience, as they were being violently and inhumanly dragged along.</p>

<p>And the proconsul, having tortured the Apostle Philip and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who were with him, ordered them to be brought, and secured in the temple of the idol of the viper by its <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, until he should decide by what death he should destroy each of them. And many of the crowd <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and were added to the Apostle Philip, and those with him, having renounced the idol of the viper, and were confirmed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, being magnified by the endurance of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; and all together with their voice <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying the <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>.</p>

<p>And when they were shut up in the temple of the viper&mdash; both Philip the Apostle, and Bartholomew and Mariamme&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the viper assembled in the same place, and a great crowd, about seven thousand men; and having run to the proconsul, they cried out, saying: Avenge us of the foreigners, and magicians, and corrupters and seducers of men. For ever since they came to us, our city has been filled with every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deed</a>; and they have also killed the serpents, the sons of our goddess; and they have also shut the temple, and the altar has been desolated; and we have not found the wine which had been brought in order that the viper, having drunk of it, might go to sleep. But if you wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are really magicians, look and see how they wish to bewitch us, saying, Live in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, after believing in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and how also they have come into the city; and how also the dragons have not struck them blind, or even killed them; and how also they have not drunk their blood; but even they who keep our city from every foreigner have been cast down by these men.</p>

<p>And the proconsul, having heard these things, was the more inflamed with rage, and filled with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and threatening; and he was exceedingly enraged, and said to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: Why <em>need you speak</em>, when they have bewitched my own wife? And from that time she has spoken to me with strange words; and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> all the night through, she speaks in a strange tongue with a light shining round her; and groaning aloud, she says, Jesus the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light has come to me. And I, having gone forth from my chamber, wished to look down through the window and see Jesus, the light which she spoke of; and like lightning it came upon me, so that I was within a little of being blinded; and from that time forth I am afraid of my wife, on account of her luminous Jesus. Tell me, you <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, what I am to do. And they said to him: O proconsul, assuredly we are no longer <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; for ever since you shut them up, in consequence of them <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, not only has the temple been shaken from the foundations, but it is also assuredly falling down.</p>

<p>Then the proconsul ordered to bring Philip and those with him forth out of the temple, and to bring them up to the tribunal, saying to the public executioner: Strip Philip and Bartholomew and Mariamme, and search thoroughly to try to find their enchantments. Having therefore first stripped Philip, then Bartholomew, they came also to Mariamme; and dragging her along, they said: Let us strip her naked, that all may see her, how she follows men; for she especially deceives all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. And the tyrant says to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: Proclaim throughout the whole city round about that all should come, men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, that they may see her indecency, that she travels about with these magicians, and no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with them. And he ordered Philip to be hanged, and his ankles to be pierced, and to bring also iron hooks, and his heels also to be driven through, and to be hanged head downwards, opposite the temple on a certain tree; and stretch out Bartholomew opposite Philip, having nailed his hands on the wall of the gate of the temple.</p>

<p>And both of them smiled, seeing each other, both Philip and Bartholomew; for they were as if they were not tortured: for their punishments were prizes and crowns. And when also they had stripped Mariamme, behold, straightway the semblance of her body was changed in the presence of all, and straightway there was about her a cloud of fire before all; and they could not longer look at all on the place in which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Mariamme was, but they all fled from her.</p>

<p>And Philip spoke with Bartholomew in the Hebrew tongue saying: Where is our brother John? For, behold, I am being released from the body; and who is he that has <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for us? Because they have also laid hands on our sister Mariamme, contrary to what is meet; and, behold, they have set fire to the house of Stachys, saying, Let us burn it, since he entertained them. Do you wish then, Bartholomew, fire to come from heaven, and that we should burn them up?</p>

<p>And as Philip was thus speaking, behold, also John entered into the city like one of their fellow citizens; and moving about in the street, he asked: Who are these men, and why are they punished? And they say to him: It cannot be that you are of our city, and ask about these men, who have wronged many: for they have shut up our gods, and by their magic have cut off both the serpents and the dragons; and they have also raised many of the dead, who have struck us with amazement, detailing many punishments <em>against us</em>, and they wish also, these strangers who are hanging, to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for fire out of heaven, and to burn up us and our city.</p>

<p>Then says John: Let us go, and do you show me them. They led John, therefore, as their fellow-citizen, to where Philip was; and there was there a great crowd, and the proconsul, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. And Philip, seeing John, said to Bartholomew in Hebrew: Brother, John has come, who was in Barek, where the living water is.  And John saw Philip hanging head downwards both by the ankles and the heels;  and he also saw Bartholomew stretched out on the wall of the temple; and he said to them: The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of him that was hanged between the heaven and the earth shall be with you.</p>

<p>And he said also to the men of that city: You men who dwell in Ophioryma Hierapolis, great is the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which is among you, for you have erred in the path of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. The dragon breathing has breathed upon you, and blinded you in three ways; that is, he has made you blind in body, and blind in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and blind in spirit: and you have been struck by the destroyer. Look upon the whole creation, whether in the earth, or in the heaven, or in the waters, that the serpent has no resemblance to anything above;  but he is of the stock of corruption, and has been brought to nothing by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and on this account he is twisted and crooked, and there is no life in him; and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and rage, and darkness, and fire, and smoke are in all his members. And now, therefore, why do you punish these men because they have told you that the serpent is your enemy?</p>

<p>And when they heard these words from John, they raised their hands against him, saying: We thought you to be a fellow-citizen, but now you have shown yourself that you are their companion. Like them, so also you shall be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have intended to squeeze out your blood, and having mixed it with wine, to bring it to the viper to drink it. When, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> attempted to lay hold of John, their hands were paralyzed. And John said to Philip: Let us not at all render <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And Philip said to John: Behold now, where is my Lord Jesus, who told me not to avenge myself? But for my part, I shall not endure it longer; but I will accomplish upon them my threat, and will destroy them all. </p>

<p>And John and Bartholomew and Mariamme restrained him, saying: Our Master was beaten, was scourged, was extended <em>on the cross</em>, was made to drink gall and vinegar, and said, Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do. <span class="stiki" id="note082171"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;23:34</a></span> And this He taught, saying: Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart. <span class="stiki" id="note082172"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;11:29</a></span> Let us also therefore be patient. Philip says: Go away, and do not mollify me; for I will not bear that they have hanged me head down, and pierced my ankles and my heels with irons. And you, John, beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how much have you reasoned with them, and you have not been listened to! Wherefore go away from me, and I will curse them, and they shall be destroyed utterly to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. And he began to curse them, invoking, and crying out in Hebrew: <span class="sc">Abalo, aremun, iduthael, tharseleon, nachoth, aidunaph, teletoloi</span>:  that is, O Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the only and Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom all ages dread, powerful and impartial Judge, whose name is in Your dynasty Sabaoth,  blessed are You for everlasting: before You tremble dominions and powers of the celestials, and the fire-breathing threats of the cherubic living ones; the King, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in majesty, whose name came upon the wild beasts of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and they were tamed, and praised You with a rational voice; who lookest upon us, and readily grantest our requests; who <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> us before we were fashioned; the Overseer of all: now, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, let the great Hades open its mouth; let the great abyss swallow up these the ungodly, who have not been willing to receive the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in this city. So let it be, Sabaoth. And, behold, suddenly the abyss was opened, and the whole of the place in which the proconsul was sitting was swallowed up, and the whole of the temple, and the viper which they worshipped, and great crowds, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the viper, about seven thousand men, besides <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children, except where the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were: they remained unshaken. And the proconsul was swallowed up into the abyss; and their voices came up from beneath, saying, with weeping: Have mercy upon us, O God of Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, because we now see the judgments of those who have not confessed the crucified One: behold, the cross illumines us. O <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, manifest Yourself to us, because we are all coming down alive into Hades, and are being scourged because we have <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> crucified Your <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. And a voice was heard of one, saying: I shall be merciful to you in the cross of light.</p>

<p>And there remained both Stachys and all his house, and the wife of the proconsul, and fifty other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> with her upon the Lord, and a multitude besides, both of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and a hundred <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who had not been swallowed up because of their <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, having been sealed with the seal of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>Then the Lord, having appeared unto Philip, said: O Philip, did you not hear: You shall not render <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? And why have you inflicted such destruction? O Philip, whosoever puts his hand to the plough, and looks backwards, <span class="stiki" id="note082175"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse62">Luke&nbsp;9:62</a></span> is his furrow well set? Or who gives up his own lamp to another, and himself sits in darkness? Or who forsakes his own dwelling-place, and dwells on a dunghill himself? And who, giving away his own garment in winter, goes naked? Or what enemy rejoices in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the man that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> him? And what soldier goes to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> without a full suit of armour? And what slave who has fulfilled his master's order will not be commended? And who in the race-course, having nobly run, does not receive the prize? And who that has washed his garments willingly defiles them? Behold, my bride chamber is ready; but blessed is he who has been found in it wearing the shining garment: <span class="stiki" id="note082176"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;22:11</a></span> he it is who receives the crown upon his head. Behold, the supper is ready; and blessed is he who is invited, and is ready to go to Him that has invited him. The harvest of the field is much, <span class="stiki" id="note082177"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;9:37</a></span> and blessed is the good labourer. Behold the lilies and all the flowers, and it is the good husbandman who is the first to get a share of them. And how have you become, O Philip, unmerciful, having cursed your enemies in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>?</p>

<p>Philip says: Why are You <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with me, Lord, because I have cursed my   enemies? For why do You not tread them under foot, because they are yet alive in the abyss? And do You <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a>, Lord, that because of You I came into this city, and in Your name I have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> all the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>? The dragons and the serpents have withered away. And since these men have not received Your light, therefore have I cursed them, and they have gone down to Hades alive.</p>

<p>And the Saviour said to Philip: But since you have disobeyed me, and have requited <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and have not kept my commandment, on this account you shall finish your course <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> indeed, and shall be led by the hand by my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and shall come with them even to the paradise of delight; and they indeed shall come beside me into paradise, but you will I order to be shut outside of paradise for forty days, in terror under the flaming and turning sword, and you shall groan because you have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to those who have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to you. And after forty days I shall send my archangel Michael; and he, having taken hold of the sword guarding paradise, shall bring you into it, and you shall see all the righteous who have walked in their innocence, and then you shall worship the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of my Father in the heavens. Nevertheless the sign of your departure shall be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in my cross. And Bartholomew having gone away into Lycaonia, shall there also be himself crucified; and Mariamme shall lay her body in the river Jordan. But I, O Philip, will not endure you, because you have swallowed up the men into the abyss; but, behold, my Spirit is in them, and I shall bring them up from the dead; and thus they, seeing you, shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him that sent you.</p>

<p>And the Saviour having turned, stretched up His hand, and marked a cross in the air coming down from above even to the abyss, and it was full of light, and had its form after the likeness of a ladder. And all the multitude that had gone down from the city into the abyss came up on the ladder of the luminous cross; but there remained below the proconsul, and the viper which they worshipped. And when the multitude had come up, having looked upon Philip hanging head downwards, they lamented with a great lamentation at the lawless action which they had done. And they also saw Bartholomew, and Mariamme having her former appearance. And, behold, the Lord went up into the heavens in the sight of Philip, and Bartholomew and Mariamme, and Stachys, and all the unbelieving people, and silently they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> God in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling. And all the multitudes cried out, saying: He alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom these men proclaim in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; He alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who sent these men for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Let us therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> repent for our great <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, because we are by no means worthy of everlasting life. Now we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, because we have seen great wonders, because the Saviour has brought us up from the abyss. And they all fell upon their face, and adored Philip, and entreated him, ready to flee: Do not do another <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, and again send us away into the abyss. And they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that they might become worthy of the appearing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>And Philip, yet hanging, addressed them, and said: Hear and learn how great are the powers of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, remembering what you have seen below, and how your city has been overturned, with the exception of the house which received me; and now the sweetness of my God has brought you up out of the abyss, and I am <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to walk round paradise for forty days on your account, because I was enraged against you into requiting you. And this commandment alone I have not kept, in that I did not give you good in return for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But I say unto you, From this time forth, in the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, reject  the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that you may become worthy of the thanksgiving  of the Lord.</p>

<p>And some of the faithful ran up to take down Philip, and take off him the iron grapnels, and the hooks out of his ankles. But Philip said: Do not, my children, do not come near me on account of this, for thus shall be my end. Listen to me, you who have been enlightened in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, that I came to this city, not to make any merchandise, or do any other thing; but I have been destined to go out of my body in this city in the case in which you see me. Grieve not, then, that I am hanging thus; for I bear the stamp  of the first man, who was brought to the earth head downwards, and again, through the wood of the cross brought to life out of the death of the transgression. And now I accomplish that which has been enjoined upon me; for the Lord said to me, Unless you shall make that of you which is down to be up, and that which is on the left to be on the right, you shall not enter into my kingdom. Be not therefore likened to the unchanged type, for all the world has been changed, and every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> dwelling in a body is in forgetfulness of heavenly things; but let not us possessing the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the heavenly seek that which is without, which is the body and the house of slavery. Be not unbelieving, but believing, and forgive each other's faults. Behold, I hang six days, and I have blame from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Judge, because I altogether requited you <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and put a stumbling-block in the way of my rectitude. And now I am going up on high; be not sorrowful, but rather <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, because I am leaving this dwelling-place, my body, having escaped from the corruption of the dragon, who punishes every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>And Philip, having looked round upon the multitudes, said: O you who have come up out of the dead from Hades, and the swallowing up of the abyss,&mdash; and the luminous cross led you up on high, through the goodness of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>&mdash;He being God became man, having been made flesh out of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, abiding in flesh; and having died, He raised the dead, having had pity on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, having taken away the sting of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. He was great, and became small for our sake, until He should enlarge the small, and bring them into His greatness. And He it is who has sweetness; and they spat upon Him, giving Him gall to drink, in order that He might make those who were bitter against Him to taste of His sweetness. Cleave then to Him, and do not forsake Him, for He is our life to everlasting.</p>

<p>And when Philip had finished this announcement, he says to them, Loose Bartholomew; and having gone up, they loosed him. And after loosing him, Philip says to him: Bartholomew, my brother in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, you know that the Lord has sent you with me to this city, and you have shared with me in all the dangers with our sister Mariamme; but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the going forth from your body has been appointed in Lycaonia, and it has been decreed to Mariamme to go forth from the body in the river Jordan. Now therefore I command you, that when I have gone forth from my body, you shall build a church in this place; and let the leopard and the kid of the goats  come into the church, for a sign to those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; and let Nicanora provide for them until they shall go forth from the body; and when they shall have gone forth, bury them by the gate of the church. And lay your peace upon the house of Stachys, as Christ laid His peace on this city. And let all the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> stand in that house each day, watching over the sick, walking two and two; but let them have no communication with young men, that <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> may not tempt them: <span class="stiki" id="note082181"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:5</a></span> for he is a creeping serpent, and he caused <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> by means of Eve to slip into death. Let it not be so again in this time as in the case of Eve. But do you, O Bartholomew, look to them well:  and you shall give these injunctions to Stachys, and appoint him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Do not entrust the place of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> to a young man, that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Christ may not be brought to shame; and let every one that teaches have his works equal to his words. But I am going to the Lord, and take my body and prepare it for burial with Syriac sheets of paper; and do not put round me flaxen cloth, because the body of my Lord was wrapped in linen. And having prepared my body for burial in the sheets of paper, bind it tight with papyrus reeds, and bury it in the church; and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me  forty days, in order that the Lord may forgive me the transgression wherein I transgressed, in requiting those who did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to me. See, O Bartholomew, where my blood shall drop upon the earth, a plant shall spring up from my blood, and shall become a vine, and shall produce fruit of a bunch of grapes; and having taken the cluster, press it into the cup; and having partaken of it on the third day, send up on high the <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, in order that the offering may be complete.</p>

<p>And Philip, having said these things, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> thus: O Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Father of the ages, King of the light, who hast made us wise in Your wisdom, and hast given us Your understanding, and hast bestowed upon us the counsel of Your goodness, who hast never at any time left us, You are He who takes away the disease of those who flee to You for refuge; You are the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who hast given us Your presence of wisdom, who hast given us signs and wonders, and hast turned those who have gone astray; who crownest those who overcome the adversary,  You excellent Judge.  Come now, Jesus, and give me the everlasting crown of victory against every adverse dominion and power, and do not let their dark air hide me when I shall cross the waters of fire and all the abyss. O my Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, let not the enemy have ground to accuse me at Your tribunal: but put on me Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> robe, Your seal of light that ever shines, until I shall pass by all the powers of the world, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> dragon that lies in wait for us. Now therefore, my Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, make me to meet You in the air, having forgiven me the recompense which I recompensed to my enemies; and transform the form of my body into angelic <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and give me rest in Your blessedness; and let me receive the promise from You which You have promised to Your <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to everlasting.</p>

<p>And having thus spoken, Philip gave up the ghost, while all the multitudes were looking upon him, and weeping, and saying: The life of this spirit has been accomplished in peace. And they said the <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p>And Bartholomew and Mariamme took down his body, and did as Philip had commanded them, and buried it in that place. And there was straightway a voice out of the heavens: Philip the apostle has been crowned with an incorruptible crown by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Judge of the contest. And all shouted out the <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p>And after the three days the plant of the vine sprouted up where the blood of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Philip had dropped. And they did all that had been commanded them by him, offering an offering for forty days, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> without ceasing. And they built the church in that place, having appointed Stachys <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the church. And Nicanora and all the faithful assembled, and did not cease, all of them, glorifying God on account of the wonders that had happened among them. And all the city <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the name of Jesus. And Bartholomew commanded Stachys to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> into the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</p>

<p>And after the forty days, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, having appeared in the form of Philip, said to Bartholomew and Mariamme: My beloved brethren, do you wish to rest in the rest of God? Paradise has been opened to me, and I have entered into the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Jesus. Go away to the place appointed for you; for the plant that has been set apart and planted in this city shall bear excellent fruit. Having therefore saluted the brethren, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for each of them, they departed from the city of Ophioryma, the Hierapolis of Asia; and Bartholomew departed into Lycaonia, and Mariamme proceeded to the Jordan; and Stachys and those with him remained, maintaining the church in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and strength for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<h2>Acts of Saint Philip the Apostle When He Went to Upper Hellas</h2>

<p>And it came to pass in those days, when Philip entered into the city of Athens called Hellas, there assembled to him three hundred <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, saying: Let us go and see what his wisdom is; for they say about the wise men of Asia, that their wisdom is great. For they thought that Philip was a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, since he was travelling in the dress of a recluse; and they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he was an apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For the dress which Jesus gave to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> was a mantle only, and a linen cloth.  Thus, then, Philip was going about. On this account, therefore, when the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of Hellas saw him, they were afraid. They assembled therefore into one place, and said to each other: Come, let us look into our books, lest somehow this stranger overcome us, and put us to shame.</p>

<p>And having done so, they came together to the same place, and say to Philip: We have doctrines of our fathers in which we are pleased, seeking after <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; but if you have anything new, O stranger, show it to us without <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> boldly: for we have need of nothing else, but only to hear something new. <span class="stiki" id="note082186"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse21">Acts&nbsp;17:21</a></span> </p>

<p>And Philip answering, said to them: O <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of Hellas, if you wish to hear some new thing, and are desirous of something new, you ought to throw away from you the disposition of the old man; as my Lord said, It is impossible to put new wine into old bottles, since the bottle is burst, and the wine spilled, and the bottle destroyed.  But they put new wine into fresh bottles, so that both may be preserved. And these things the Lord said in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, teaching us in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> wisdom, that many will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the new wine, not having a bottle fresh and new. And I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, O men of Hellas, and I congratulate you for having said, We <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> something new. For instruction really new and fresh my Lord has brought into the world, in order that He might sweep away all worldly instruction.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> say: Who is it that you call your Lord? Philip says: My Lord is Jesus in heaven. And they said to him: Show him to our comprehension without <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, that we also may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in him. And Philip said: He with whom I am about to make you acquainted as Lord, is above every name; there is no other. <span class="stiki" id="note082188"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse21">Ephesians&nbsp;1:21</a></span> And this only I say: As you have said, Do not refuse us through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, let it not be that I should refuse you; but rather in great exultation and in great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> I have to reveal to you that name, for I have no other work in this world than this proclamation.  For when my Lord came into this world, He chose us, being twelve in number, having filled us with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; from His light He made us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who He was, and commanded us to preach all <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through Him, because there is no other name named out of heaven than this. <span class="stiki" id="note082190"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse12">Acts&nbsp;4:12</a></span> On this account I have come to you, to make you fully assured, not in word only, but also in the showing forth of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p>And when the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> heard this, they say to Philip: This name that has been heard of by us from you we have never found in the books of our fathers; now, therefore, how can we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about your words? And moreover, in addition, they say to him: Allow us three days, that we may consult with each other about this name; for we lay no little stress upon this&mdash; to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a> from our fathers' religion. Philip therefore says to them: Consult as you wish; for there is no deceit in the matter.</p>

<p>And the three hundred <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> having assembled, spoke with each other, saying: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this man has brought a strange <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and the words spoken by him bring us to distraction. What, then, shall we do about him, or about the name of him who is called Jesus, the king of the ages, whom he speaks of? And moreover they say to each other: Assuredly we cannot reason with him, but the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> can. If therefore it seem good, let us send to him, in order that he may stand up to this stranger, and that we may learn accurately the name that is preached.</p>

<p>They wrote therefore to Jerusalem after this manner:&mdash; The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of Hellas to Ananias, the great <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in Jerusalem. There being between you and us at all times great. ..as you know that we <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> are searchers after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. A certain foreigner has come to Hellas, Philip by name; and, in a word, he has disturbed us exceedingly, both by words and by extraordinary <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and he introduces a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> name, Jesus, professing himself to be his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. And he does also wonders of which we write to you, in that he has cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> that have been long in men, and makes the deaf hear, the blind see; and what is more wonderful&mdash; which also we should have first mentioned&mdash; he has raised up men after they were dead, that have fairly completed the number of their days.  And the fame of him has gone abroad into all Hellas and Macedonia; and there are many coming to him from the cities round about, bringing those who are ill with various diseases, and he heals them all through the name of Jesus. On this account, therefore, come to us without any reluctance, that you yourself may announce to us what Jesus, this name which he teaches, means. For on this account also we have sent this letter to you, O <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>.</p>

<p>And when he had read, he was filled with great <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and rent his clothes, and said: Has that deceiver gone even to Athens, among the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, to lead them astray? And the Mansemat&mdash; that is, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>&mdash; entered into Ananias unawares, and filled him with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and rage; and he said: If I allow that Philip himself, and those with him, to live, the law will be entirely destroyed, and their teaching will likely fill the whole earth. And the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> went into his own house, and the teachers of the law, and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>; and they consulted with each other, saying: What shall we do about these things?  And they say to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> Ananias: Stand up and arm yourself, and five hundred able men out of the people, and go away to Athens, and by all means kill Philip, and thus you shall overturn his teaching.</p>

<p>And having put on the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest's</a> robe, he came to Hellas in great pomp, with the five hundred men. And Philip was in the house of a certain chief man of the city, with the brethren who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> and those with him, and the three hundred <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, went up to the gateway of the house where Philip was; and it was told Philip that they were outside. And he rose up and went out. And when the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> saw him, he says to him: O Philip, sorcerer and magician, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you, that in Jerusalem your master the deceiver called you Son of Thunder.  Was not the whole of Jud&aelig;a sufficient for you, but you have come here also to deceive men who are searchers after wisdom? And Philip said: Would that, O Ananias, your covering of unbelief were taken away from your heart, that you might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my words, and from them learn whether I am a deceiver, or you!</p>

<p>Ananias having heard this, said to Philip: I shall give answer to all. And Philip said: Speak. The <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> says: O men of Hellas, this Philip believes in a man called Jesus, who was born among us, who also taught this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and destroyed the law and the temple, and brought to nought the purification through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and the new moons, because he says, These have not been commanded by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And when we saw that he thus destroyed the law, we stood up against him, and crucified him, that his teaching might not be fulfilled. For many changes were brought in by him; and he gave an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> testimony, for he ate all things in common, and mixed with blood, after the manner of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.  And having given him up, we put him to death, and buried him in a tomb; and these <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of his having stolen him, have proclaimed everywhere that he has risen from the dead, and have led astray a great multitude by professing that he is at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in heaven.  But now these men, themselves having the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> as we also have, have not followed it, since they began to do many <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of power in Jerusalem through the name of Jesus; and having been cast out of Jerusalem, they go about the world, and deceive all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by the magic of that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, as also now this Philip has come to you to deceive you by the same means. But I shall carry him away with myself to Jerusalem, because Archelaus the king is also searching for him to kill him.</p>

<p>And when the multitude standing round heard this, those indeed who had been confirmed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were not shaken nor made to waver; for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that Philip would conquer in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Jesus. Philip therefore stated his case in the power of Christ with great boldness, exulting and saying: I, O men of Athens, and those of you who are <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, have come to you, not to teach you with words, but by the showing forth of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; and in part you have quickly seen  the things that have come to pass through me, in that name by which the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> himself is cast off.  For, behold, I shall cry to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and teach you, and you will prove the words of both.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> having heard this, ran to Philip, wishing to scourge him, and that same hour his whole hand was dried up, and his eyes were blinded; and in like manner also the five hundred who were with him were also themselves blinded. And they reviled and cursed the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, saying: Coming out of Jerusalem we said to you, Refrain; for, being men, we cannot fight against God.  But we entreat you, O Philip, apostle of the God Jesus, give us the light that is through him, that we also may <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> be his slaves.</p>

<p>And Philip, having seen what had come to pass, said: O weak nature! Which has thrown itself upon us, but straightway has been brought down low into itself; O bitter sea! Which rouses its waves against us, and thinks to cast us out, but which by itself lulls its waves to rest. Now therefore, O our good steward Jesus, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> light, You have not overlooked us who are all together crying up to You in all good works, but hast come to finish them through us. Now therefore come, Lord Jesus; reprove the folly of these men.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> says to Philip: Do you then think to turn us away from the traditions of our fathers, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; and do you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that you will make us followers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> the Nazarene? Then Philip says to him: Behold, I shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to my God to come and manifest Himself before you and the five hundred, and before all here; for perhaps you will change your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. But if even to the end you remain in unbelief, there is coming upon you an extraordinary thing, which shall be spoken of to generations of generations&mdash; that also you shall go down alive, down into Hades, before the face of all seeing you, because you yet abide  in unbelief, because also you seek to turn away this multitude from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life. And Philip <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, saying: O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Father of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who hast granted to me to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, send Your beloved Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to reprove the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, that Your name may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Christ the Beloved.</p>

<p>And while Philip was yet crying out this, suddenly the heavens were opened, and Jesus appeared coming down in most excellent <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and in lightning; and His face was shining sevenfold more than the sun, and His garments were whiter than snow, so that also all the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of Athens fell suddenly to the ground. And the people fled in anguish; and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> dwelling among them cried out: Behold, we also flee because of Him who has appeared to the city, Jesus the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Then Philip says to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>: Do you hear the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> crying out because of Him who has been seen, and do you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him who is present that He is Lord of all? The <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> says: I have no other God than the one in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>.</p>

<p>And as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was going up into heaven there happened a very great earthquake, so that the place on which they stood was cleft; and the crowds ran and fell at the feet of the apostle, crying out: Have mercy upon us, O man of God! In like manner also the five hundred men cried out themselves also again: Have mercy upon us, O Philip, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you, and through you Jesus the light of life: for we said to this unbelieving <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, Being sinful men, we cannot fight against God.</p>

<p>Then Philip says: There is no <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> in us, but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ will make you receive your sight; but I will make the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> receive his sight before you, that at this you may the more <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. And a voice out of heaven was brought to Philip: O Philip, son once of thunder, but now of meekness, whatever you may ask of my Father, He shall do for you. And all the crowd was terror-struck at the voice, for the sound of it was greater than that of thunder. Then Philip says to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>: In the name of the power of the voice of my Lord, receive your sight, Ananias. And immediately he received his sight, and looked round, and said: What is there in the magic of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that this Philip within a short time has made me blind, and again within a short time has made me receive my sight? Do you then, said Philip, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Jesus? The <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> says: You do not think, do you, that you can bewitch me, and persuade me? And the five hundred who were with him, having heard that their <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, having received his sight, was yet unbelieving, said to the bystanders to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> Philip that he should make them receive their sight, that, <em>said they</em>, we may cut off this unbelieving <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>.</p>

<p>And Philip said: Do not avenge yourselves upon the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. And he says to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>: There will be a certain great sign upon you. He says to Philip: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are a sorcerer and a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Jesus: you do not bewitch me. And the apostle said to Jesus: <span class="sc">Sabarthan, sabathabt, bramanuch</span>, come quickly. And immediately the earth was cleft in the place where Ananias was, and swallowed him up as far as the knees. And Ananias cried out: O great <em>is the</em> power of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15674b.htm">witchcraft</a>, because it has cleft the earth, when Philip threatened it in Hebrew, and adjured it; and it holds me even to the knees, and by the heels some hooks as it were drag me downwards, that I may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Philip; but he cannot persuade me, for from Jerusalem I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his magic tricks.</p>

<p>And Philip, enraged, said: O earth, lay fast hold of him, even to the navel. And immediately it dragged him down. And he said: The one of my feet underneath is turned into ice, and the other is frightfully hot; but by your magic, Philip, I will not be overcome. Except, therefore, that I am sore tortured underneath, I do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> at all. And the crowds wished to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> him. And Philip says: Not so; for this has in the meantime happened, that he has been swallowed up as far as the navel, that the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> may be effected, because he would almost have drawn you by his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> words into unbelief. But if even he repented, I should bring him up out of the earth to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; but assuredly he is not worthy of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. If, then, he remain in unbelief, you shall see him sunk down into the abyss, unless the Lord intends to raise those who are in Hades, that they may confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is Lord. For in that day every tongue shall confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note082200"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse11">Philippians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> and that there is one <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> for evermore.</p>

<p>And Philip, having said this, extended his right hand, stretching it through the air over the five hundred men in the name of Jesus. And their eyes were opened, and they all praised God with one mouth, saying: We bless You, O Christ Jesus, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Philip, that you have driven the blindness away from us, and hast given us Your light, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. And Philip rejoiced exceedingly at their words, because they were thus confirmed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And after this, Philip, having turned to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, said: Confess also in a pure heart that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is Lord, that you may be saved, like those with you. But the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> laughed at Philip, and remained in unbelief.</p>

<p>Philip then, seeing that he remained in unbelief, having looked at him, says to the earth: Open your mouth, and swallow him up as far as his neck in the presence of those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>. And in the same hour the earth, having opened its mouth, received him as far as the neck. And the multitude communed with each other on account of the wonders that had happened.</p>

<p>A certain chief man of the city came crying out, and saying: O blessed apostle, a certain <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> has assailed my son, and cried out, saying to me, Since you have allowed a foreigner to come into your city, you who have been the first to do away with  our worship and our <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, what shall I do for you, except to kill this your only begotten son? And after he said this, he strangled my son. Now therefore, I beseech you, O apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, do not allow my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to be turned into sorrow, because I also have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> your words.</p>

<p>And the apostle, having heard this, said: I wonder at the activity of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, that it is active in every place, and dares to assail those to whose help I have not been able to come,  as now they have tried you, wishing to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to offend. And he says to the man: Bring me your son, and I will give him to you alive, through my Christ. And rejoicing, he ran to bring his son. And when he came near his house, he cried out, saying: My son, I have come to you to carry you to the apostle, so that he may present you to me living. And he ordered his slaves to carry the bed; and his son was twenty-three years old. And when Philip saw him, he was moved; and he turned to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and said: This has happened as a chance for you: if, therefore, I shall raise him up, will you henceforth <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? And he says: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your magic arts, that you will raise him up; but I will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you. And Philip, enraged, said: A curse upon you! Then go down altogether into the abyss before the face of all these. And at the same hour he went down into Hades alive, except that the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest's</a> robe flew off from him; and because of this, from that day, no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what became of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> robe. And the apostle turned round and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the boy; and having driven the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> away from him, he raised him up, and set him beside his father alive.</p>

<p>And the multitude having beheld this, cried out: The God of Philip is the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has punished the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and driven away the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> from the young man, and raised him up from the dead. And the five hundred having seen the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> swallowed up into the abyss, and the other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, besought Philip, and he gave them the seal in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And Philip abode in Athens two years; and having founded a church, appointed a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and so went away to Parthia, preaching Christ. To whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<h2>Addition to Acts of Philip</h2>

<p>(From a Paris ms.) </p>

<p>And he taught them thus: My brethren, sons of my Father&mdash; for you are of my <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> as to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, substance of my city, the Jerusalem above, the delight of my dwelling-place&mdash; why have you been taken captive by your enemy the serpent, twisted, crooked, and perverse, to whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given neither hands nor feet? And crooked is his going, since he is the son of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one; for his father is death, and his mother corruption, and ruin is in his body. Do not go then into his destruction; for you are in bondage by the unbelief and deception of his son, who is without order, and has no substance;  formless, and has no form in the whole creation, either in the heaven or in the earth, or among the fishes that are in the waters. But if you see him, flee from him, since he has no resemblance to men: his dwelling is the abyss, and he walks in darkness. Flee, then, from him, that his venom may not be poured out upon you: if his venom be poured out upon your body, you walk in his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. But remain rather in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worship, being faithful, reverent, and good, without guile. Flee from <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> the dragon, and remove from you his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> seed, namely desire, by which he begets disease in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is the venom of the serpent. For desire is of the serpent from the beginning, and she it is who arms herself against the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>; for she came forth out of the darkness, and returns to the darkness. You ought therefore, after coming to us, or rather through us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to throw out the venom of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> from your bodies.</p>

<p>And as the apostle was saying this, behold, Nicanora came forth from her house, and went with her slaves into the house of Stachys. And when she came near the door of the house, behold, Mariamme spoke to her in the <a href="../cathen/14408a.htm">Syriac language</a>: <span class="sc">Helikomaei, kosma, etaa, mariacha</span> . And she explained her words, saying: O daughter of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, you are my lady, who hast been given in pledge to the serpent; but I have come to deliver you: I shall break your bonds, and cut them from their root. Behold, the Deliverer that frees you has come: behold, the Sun of righteousness has risen to enlighten you.</p>

<p>And when she was thus speaking, the gloomy tyrant came running and panting. And Nicanora, who was before the door, heard this, and took <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> before them all, crying out and saying: I am a Hebrew, a daughter of the Hebrews; speak with me in the language of my fathers, because I have heard your preaching, and have been cured of this my disease. I reverence and glorify the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in that He has made you to be utterly spoiled in this earth.</p>

<p>And when she said this, the tyrant came, and took hold of her garments, and said: O Nicanora, did I not leave you lying on the bed from your disease? Whence, then, have you found this power and strength, so as to be able to come to these magicians? Unless, then, you tell who is the healer, I shall punish you most severely. And Nicanora answered, and said: O rearer of tyrants, cast away from yourself this tyranny, and forget your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> works, and abandon this temporary life, and put away vainglory, because it passes like a shadow: seek rather what is everlasting, and take away from yourself the beastly and impious work of base desire, and reject vain intercourse, which is the husbandry of death, the dark <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; and overturn the middle wall of corruption, and prepare for yourself a life chaste and spotless, that we may altogether live in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. If, then, you wish me to remain with you, I will live with you in continence.</p>

<p>And when the tyrant heard these words, he seized her by the hair of the head, and dragged her along, kicking her, and saying: It would be better for you to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by my sword, than to be seen with these foreign magicians and deceivers. I will punish you, therefore, and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> those who have deceived you. And he turned in a rage to the executioners who followed him, and said: Bring me these <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">impostors</a>. And the executioners ran to the house of Stachys, and laid hold of Philip, and Bartholomew, and Mariamme, with the leopard and the kid of the goats, and dragged them along, and brought them.</p>

<p>When the tyrant saw them, he gnashed his teeth against them, and said: Drag along these magicians and deceivers that have deceived many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> by saying, We are worshippers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And he caused thongs to be brought, and bound their feet. And he ordered them to be dragged along from the gate as far as the temple. And great multitudes came together to that place. And they wondered exceedingly at the leopard and the kid; for they were speaking like men, and some of the multitude <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the words of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</p>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> said to the tyrant: These men are magicians. And when he heard that, he burned with rage, and was filled with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; and he ordered Philip, and Bartholomew, and Mariamne to be stripped, saying: Search them. Perhaps you will find their sorcery. And the executioners stripped them, and laid hold of Mariamne, and dragged her along, saying: Uncover her, that they may learn that it is a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who follows them. And he ordered to bring clubs and strong cords; and after piercing Philip's ankles they brought hooks, and put the cords through his ankles, and hung him head downwards on a tree that was before the door of the temple; and they fixed pegs into the temple wall, and left him. And after binding Bartholomew hand and foot, they extended him naked on the wall; and when they had stripped Mariamne, the appearance of her body was changed, and became a glass chest filled with light, and they could not come near her.</p>

<p>And Philip spoke with Bartholomew in Hebrew: Where is John today, in the day of our need? For behold, we are being delivered from our bodies. And they have laid hands on Mariamne beyond what is seemly, and they have scourged the leopard and the kid of the goats, and have set fire to the house of Stachys, because he took us in. Let us therefore speak, that fire may come down from heaven and burn them up.</p>

<p>And as Philip was thus speaking, behold, John came into the city, and walked about the street, and asked those in the city: What is the commotion, and who are these men, and why are they punished? And they say to him: Are you not of this city? And do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about these men, how they disturbed our houses, and the whole city? Moreover, they have even persuaded our wives to go away from us on the pretence of religion, proclaiming a foreign name, viz. Christ's; and they have also shut our temples by the sorcery they have, and they have <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> the serpents that are in the city by foreign names that we have never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. And they have fixed their abode in the house of Stachys the blind man, whom they made to recover his sight through the spittle of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who accompanies them; and it is perhaps she who has all the sorcery: and there accompany them a leopard and a kid, speaking like men. But if ever you have seen such doings, you will not be put about by them. And John answered, and said to them: Show me them. And they brought him to the temple where Philip was hanging. And when Philip saw John, he said to Bartholomew: O my brother, behold the son of Barega&mdash; that is the living water&mdash; has come. And John saw Philip hanging head down, tied by his ankles; and saw Bartholomew also bound to the temple wall.</p>

<p>And he said to the men of the city: O children of the serpent, how great is your folly! For the way of deceit has deceived you, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> dragon breathing has breathed upon you: why do you punish these men for saying the serpent is your enemy?</p>

<p>And when they heard these words from John, they laid their hands upon him, saying: We called you our fellow-citizen, but now your speech has made you manifest that you also are in communion with them.  You also, therefore, shall be put to the same death as they, for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have decided thus: Let us drain out their blood as they hang head downward, and mix it with wine, and offer it to the viper.</p>

<p>And when they were thus speaking, behold, Mariamne rose up from the place in which she was, and came back to her former appearance.</p>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> reached forth their hands towards John, wishing to lay hold of him, and they could not. Then Philip with Bartholomew said to John: Where is Jesus, who enjoins upon us not to take into our own hands vengeance on those that torture us? For after this I will not endure them. And Philip spoke in Hebrew, and said: My Father Uthael, i.e., O Christ, Father of majesty, whose name all the ages  <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, who art powerful, and the power of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, whose name goes forth in lordship,  Eloa: Blessed are You to the ages;  You whom dominions and powers <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, trembling before Your face; King of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>! Father of majesty! Whose name has gone forth to the wild beasts of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and they have become quiet because of You, and through You the serpents have departed from us: Hear us before we ask.  You who sees us before we call, who <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> our thoughts, the All-surveyor  of all, who sends forth from Himself unnumbered compassions; let the abyss open its mouth, and swallow up these godless <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who will not accept the word of Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>And in that very hour the abyss opened its mouth, and all that place was violently shaken, from the proconsul to all the multitude along with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; and they were all sunk down. And the places where the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and all who were with them were remained unshaken, and the house of Stachys, and Nicanora the tyrant's wife, and the twenty-four wives who fled from their husbands, and the forty <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> men. These alone did not go down into the abyss, because they had become servants, and had received the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and His seal; but all the rest of the city were swallowed down into the abyss.</p>

<p>And the Saviour having appeared at that hour, said to Philip: Who is it that has put his hand to the plough, and has turned back from making the furrow straight? Or who gives his light to others, and himself remains sitting in darkness? Or who dwells in the dirt, and leaves his dwelling-place to strangers? Or who lays down his garment, and goes out in the days of winter naked? Or what slave that has done his master's service, shall not be called by him to supper? Or who runs with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the racecourse, and does not get the prize? Philip, behold my bridal chamber is ready, and blessed is he who has his own shining garment; for he it is who gets the crown of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> upon his head. Behold, the supper is ready, and blessed is he who is called by the bridegroom. Great is the harvest of the field; blessed is the able workman.</p>

<p>And when Philip heard these words from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, he answered and said to him: You gave us leave, O <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, and do you not enjoin us to smite those who do not wish You to reign over them? But this we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that Your name has not been proclaimed in all the world, and You have sent us to this city. And I did not intend to come into this city, and You sent me, after giving me Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> commandment, that I should drive away all deceit, and bring to nothing every idol and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, and all the power of the unclean one. And when I came here, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> fled from our faces through Your name, and the dragons and the serpents withered away, but these men did not take to themselves Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light; and for this reason I resolved to bring them low, according to their folly.</p>

<p>And the Saviour said: O Philip, since you have forsaken this commandment of mine, not to render <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,  for this reason you shall be debarred in the next world for forty years from being in the place of my promise: besides, this is the end of your departure from the body in this place; and Bartholomew has his lot in Lycaonia, and shall be crucified there; and Mariamne shall lay down her body in the river Jordan.</p>

<p>And the Saviour turned and stretched out His hand, and made the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> in the air; and it was full of light, and had its form after the likeness of a ladder. And all the multitude of the men of the city who had gone down into the abyss came up upon the ladder of the cross of light and none of them remained in the abyss, but only the tyrant and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the viper which they worshipped. And when the multitudes came up from the abyss, they looked and saw Philip hanging head down, and Bartholomew upon the wall of the temple, and they also found Mariamne in her first shape. And the Saviour went up into heaven in the sight of Philip and Bartholomew and Mariamne, and the leopard and the kid of the goats, and Nicanora and Stachys; and they all with a loud voice <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> God with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling, crying out: There is one God who has sent us His <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, whose name these men proclaim: we repent therefore of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in which we were before yesterday, not being worthy of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; and we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, having seen the wonderful things that have come to pass through us. And some of them threw themselves on their faces, and worshipped the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; and others made ready to flee, saying: There may be another earthquake like the one that has just happened.</p>

<p>And stretching out his hands, the Apostle Philip, hanging head down, said: Men of the city, hear these words which I am going to say to you, hanging head down. You have learned how great are the powers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the wonders which you saw when your city was destroyed by the earthquake which came upon it. And this was manifest to you, that the house of Stachys was not destroyed and that he did not go down into the abyss, because he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and received us His servants. And I, having fulfilled all the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, am His debtor for what I requited to him that did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to me.</p>

<p>And some of those who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> ran to loose Philip hanging head down. And he answered and said to them: My brethren,...  those who are <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in the members of their flesh and commit fornication in their hearts, and the fornication of their eyes, shall abound like the deluge. And they grow immoderate from listening to persuasive pleasures, forgetting the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; and their hearts are full of arrogance, eating and drinking in their worship, forgetting the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> commandment, and despising it. That generation is turned aside; but blessed is he that retires into his retreat, for he shall obtain rest in his departure. Do you not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a>, Bartholomew, that the word of our Lord is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? For the Lord said to us in His teaching, Every one who shall look upon a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after her in his heart, has completed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note082210"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;5:28</a></span> And on this account our brother Peter fled from every place in which a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was, and yet there was scandal on account of his own daughter; and he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the Lord, and she had paralysis of her side, that she might not be deceived. You see, brother, that the sight of the eyes brings gainsaying, and the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as it is written, <span class="stiki" id="note082211"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;3:6</a></span> She looked, and saw the tree, that it was pleasing to her eyes, and good for food, and she was deceived. Let the hearing, then, of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; and in their going out let them walk two and two, for many are the wiles of the enemy. Let their walk and conversation be well ordered, that they may be saved; but if not, let their fruit be common.</p>

<p>My brother Bartholomew, give these promises to Stachys, and appoint him ruler and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that he may be like you, teaching well. Do not entrust the office to a man too young: appoint not such a one to the chair of the teachers, lest you profane the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For he that teaches should have his works corresponding to his words, that the word may be ready on every occasion in its own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But I am being released from my body, hanging head down. Take, then, my body, and prepare it for burial in Syrian paper, and do not put about it linen cloth, since they put it upon the body of our Lord, and wrap it close in paper and papyrus, and put it in the vestibule of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> church. And <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> over me for forty days, that God may forgive the transgression which I did, in that I requited <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to him that did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to me, and there may not be for me in the world to come the forty years.</p>

<p>And after thus speaking, Philip <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, saying: My Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Father of the ages, King of all light, who makes us wise in Your wisdom, who has given us the exalted <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, who has graciously conferred upon us the counsel of Your goodness, who has never departed from us;  You who takes away disease from those who take refuge in You;  You who has given us the Word, to turn unto You those who have been led astray;  You who has given us signs and wonders on behalf of those of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; You who presentest the crown to those who have conquered; You who are the judge of the games, who has given us the crown of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, who speaks with us, that we may be able to withstand those that hurt us; You are He who sows and reaps, and completes, and increases, and vivifies all Your own servants: reproaches and threats are to us help and power through those who turn to You through us, who are Your servants. Come, Lord, and give me the crown of victory in the presence of men. Let not their dark air envelope me, nor their smoke burn the shape of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that I may cross the waters of the abyss, and not sink in them. My Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, let not the enemy find anything that he can bring against me in the presence of You, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Judge, but clothe me in Your shining robe, and...(The rest is missing.)</p>
