<h1>The Acts of Thaddaeus, One of the Twelve</h1>

<p><span class="sc">Lebb&aelig;us</span>, who also is Thadd&aelig;us, was of the city of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>&mdash; and it is the metropolis of Osroene, in the interior of the Armenosyrians&mdash; an Hebrew by race, accomplished and most learned in the divine writings. He came to Jerusalem to worship in the days of John the Baptist; and having heard his preaching and seen his angelic life, he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and his name was called Thadd&aelig;us. And having seen the appearing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and His teaching, and His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a>, he followed Him, and became His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>; and He chose him as one of the twelve, the tenth apostle according to the Evangelists Matthew and Mark.</p>

<p>In those times there was a governor of the city of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> by name. And there having gone abroad the fame of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of the wonders which He did, and of His teaching, <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> having heard of it, was astonished, and desired to see Christ, and could not leave his city and government. And about the days of the Passion and the plots of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a>, being seized by an incurable disease, sent a letter to Christ by Ananias the courier,  to the following effect:&mdash; To Jesus  called Christ, <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> the governor of the country of the <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessenes</a>, an unworthy slave. The multitude of the wonders done by you has been heard of by me, that you heal the blind, the lame, and the paralytic, and curest all the <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniacs</a>; and on this account I entreat your goodness to come even to us, and escape from the plottings of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, which through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> they set in motion against you. My city is small, but large enough for both. <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> enjoined Ananias to take accurate account of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of what appearance He was, and His stature, and His hair, and in a word everything.</p>

<p>And Ananias, having gone and given the letter, was carefully looking at Christ, but was unable to fix Him in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. And He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the heart, and asked to wash Himself; and a towel  was given Him; and when He had washed Himself, He wiped His face with it. And His image having been imprinted upon the linen, He gave it to Ananias, saying: Give this, and take back this message, to him that sent you: Peace to you and your city! For because of this I have come, to suffer for the world, and to rise again, and to raise up the forefathers. And after I have been taken up into the heavens I shall send you my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> Thadd&aelig;us, who shall enlighten you, and guide you into all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, both you and your city.</p>

<p>And having received Ananias, and fallen down and adored the likeness, <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> was cured of his disease before Thadd&aelig;us came.</p>

<p>And after the passion, and the resurrection, and the ascension, Thadd&aelig;us went to <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a>; and having found him in health, he gave him an account of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> him, with all his house. And having instructed great multitudes, both of Hebrews and Greeks, Syrians and Armenians, he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, having anointed them with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> perfume; and he communicated to them of the undefiled <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the sacred body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and delivered to them to keep and observe the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, and to give close heed to the things that had been said by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in Jerusalem. For year by year they came together to the passover, and again he imparted to them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>And Thadd&aelig;us along with <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgarus</a> destroyed idol-temples and built churches; ordained as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> one of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and gave them the rule of the psalmody and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> liturgy. And having left them, he went to the city of Amis, great metropolis of the Mesechaldeans and Syrians, that is, of Mesopotamia-<a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, beside the river Tigris. And he having gone into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> along with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, after the reading of the law the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> said to Thadd&aelig;us and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: Men, whence are you? And why are you here?</p>

<p>And Thadd&aelig;us said: No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> you have heard of what has taken place in Jerusalem about <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and we are His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and witnesses of the wonderful things which He did and taught, and how through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> delivered Him to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of Jud&aelig;a. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, having examined Him and found no case,  wished to let Him go; but they cried out, If you let him go, you are not C&aelig;sar's friend, because he proclaims himself king. And he being afraid, washed his hands in the sight of the multitude, and said, I am innocent of the blood of this man; see ye to it. And the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> answered and said, His blood be upon us and our children. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> gave him up to them. And they took Him, and spit upon Him, with the soldiers, and made a great mock of Him, and crucified Him, and laid Him in the tomb, and secured it well, having also set guards upon Him. And on the third day before dawn He rose, leaving His burial-clothes in the tomb. And He was seen first by His mother and other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and by Peter and John first of my fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and thereafter to us the twelve, who ate and drank with Him after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> for many days. And He sent us in His name to proclaim repentance and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, that those who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, having had the kingdom of the heavens preached to them, would rise up incorruptible at the end of this age; and He gave us power to expel <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and heal every disease and every malady, and raise the dead.</p>

<p>And the multitudes having heard this, brought together their sick and <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniacs</a>. And Thadd&aelig;us, having gone forth along with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, laid his hand upon each one of them, and healed them all by calling upon the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniacs</a> were healed before Thadd&aelig;us came near them, the spirits going out of them. And for many days the people ran together from different places, and beheld what was done by Thadd&aelig;us. And hearing his teaching, many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, confessing their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>Having therefore remained with them for five years, he built a church; and having appointed as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> one of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them, he went away, going round the cities of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and teaching, and healing all the sick; whence he brought many cities and countries to Christ through His teaching. Teaching, therefore, and evangelizing along with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and healing the sick, he went to Berytus, a city of <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a> by the sea;  and there, having taught and enlightened many, he fell asleep on the twenty-first  of the month of August. And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> having come together, buried him with great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; and many sick were healed, and they gave <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
