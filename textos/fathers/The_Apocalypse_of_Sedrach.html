<h1>The Apocalypse of Sedrach</h1>

<p>The Word of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed Sedrach concerning <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and concerning repentance and Orthodox <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and concerning the Second Coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. Lord give your blessing.</p>

<p>1. Beloved, let us prefer nothing in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> except sincere <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: for in many things we stumble every day and night and hour. And for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> let us gain <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, for it covers a multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: for what is the profit, my children, if we have all things, and have not saving love...</p>

<p>O blessed <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, supplier of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. Blessed is the man who has gained the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and sincere <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, according as the Master said, there is no greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> than this that a man should lay down his life for his friend. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse13">John 15:13</a></span>.</p>

<p>2. And invisibly he received a voice in his ears: Come hither, Sedrach, since you wish and desirest to converse with God and ask of him that he may reveal unto you whatever you wish to ask. And Sedrach said: What, Sir? And the voice said to him: I was sent to you to raise you here into heaven. And he said: I desired to speak mouth to mouth with God: I am not fit, Sir, to come into heaven. And stretching out his wings he took him up and he came into heaven to the very flame, and he set him as high as the third heaven, and in it stood the flame of the divinity.</p>

<p>3. And the Lord says to him: Welcome, my beloved Sedrach: What suit have you against God who created you, that you said, I desired to speak face to face with God? Sedrach says to him:  Yea, verily, the son has a suit with the Father: my Lord, why did you make the earth? The Lord says to him: For man's sake. Sedrach says: And why did You make the sea? Why did You scatter every good thing on the earth? The Lord says to him: For man's sake. Sedrach says to him:  If you did these things,  why will You destroy him? And the Lord said: Man is my work and the creature of my hands, and I discipline him as I find good.</p>

<p>4. Sedrach says to him: Chastisement and fire are your discipline: they are bitter, my Lord:  it were well for man if he had not been born: why then did you make him, my Lord? Why did you weary your undefiled hands  and create man, since you did not intend to have mercy on him? God says to him: I made <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> the first creature and placed him in Paradise in the midst of the tree of life and said to him: Eat of all the fruits, but beware of the tree of life: for if you eat of it, you shall die the death. But he transgressed my commandment, and being beguiled by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> ate of the tree.</p>

<p>5. Sedrach says to him: Of your will <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was beguiled, my Lord: You command your  <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to make approach to Adam, and the first of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> himself transgressed your commandment and did not make approach to him, and You banished him, because he transgressed your commandment and did not make any approach to the work of your hands: if you loved man, why did You not slay the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, the worker of unrighteousness? Who is able to fight an invisible spirit? And he enters like smoke into the hearts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and teaches them every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: he fights against you, the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and what can wretched man then do to him? But have mercy, O Lord, and stop the chastisements: but if not, count me also with the sinners: if you will have no mercy on the sinners, where are your mercies, where is your  compassion, O Lord?</p>

<p>6. God says to him: Be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto you that I ordered all things to be placable to him: I gave him understanding and made him the heir of heaven and earth, and I subjected all things to him, and every living thing flees from him and from before his face: but he, having received of mine, became alien, adulterous, and sinful: tell me, what father, having given his son his portion, when he takes his substance and leaves his father and goes away and becomes an alien and serves an alien, when the father sees that the son has deserted him, does not darken his heart, and does not the father go and take his substance and banish him from his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> because he deserted his father? And how have I, the wonderful and jealous <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, given him everything, and he having received these things has become an adulterer and a sinner?</p>

<p>7. Sedrach says to him: You, O Lord, created man. You <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> of what sort of mind he was and of what sort of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> we are, and you make it a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for chastisement: but cast him forth; for shall not I alone fill up the heavenly places? But if that is not to be so save man too, O Lord. He failed by your will, wretched man. Why do you waste words on me, Sedrach? I created <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and his wife and the sun and said: Behold each other how bright he is, and the wife of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is brighter in the beauty of the moon and he was the giver of her life.  Sedrach says: but of what profit are beauties if they die away into the earth? How did you say, O Lord, You shall not return <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? How is it, O Lord? The word of Your divinity never lies, and why do You retaliate on man? Or do you not in so doing render <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that among the quadrupeds there is no other so wily and unreasonable as the mule. But we strike it with the bridle when we wish: and you have <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: send them forth to guard them, and when man inclines towards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to take hold of his foot and not let him go whither he would.</p>

<p>8. God says to him: If I catch him by the foot, he will say, You have given me no <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the world. But I have left him to his own will because I loved him. Wherefore I sent forth my righteous <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to guard him night and day. Sedrach says:  I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O Lord, that of all your creatures You chiefly loved man, of the quadrupeds the sheep, of woods the olive, of fruits the vine, of flying things the bee, of rivers the Jordan, of cities Jerusalem. And all these man also loves, my Lord. God says to Sedrach: I will ask you one thing, Sedrach: if you answer me, then I may fitly help you, even though you have tempted your creator. Sedrach says: Speak.  The Lord God says: Since I made all things, how many men were born and how many died, and how many are to die and how many hairs have they? Tell me, Sedrach,  since the heaven was created and the earth, how many trees grew in the world, and how many fell, and how many are to fall, and how many are to arise, and how many leaves have they? Tell me, Sedrach, since I made the sea, how many waves arose and how many fell, and how many are to arise, and how many winds blow along the margin of the sea? Tell me, Sedrach, from the creation of the world of the <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&aelig;ons</a>, when the air rained, how many drops fell upon the world, and how many are to fall? And Sedrach said: You alone <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> all these things, O Lord; you only understand all these things: only, I pray you, deliver man from chastisement, and I shall not be separated from our race.</p>

<p>9. And God said to his only begotten Son: Go,  take the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Sedrach my beloved, and place it in Paradise. The only begotten Son says to Sedrach: Give me the trust which our Father deposited in the womb of your mother in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> tabernacle of your body from a child. Sedrach says: I will not give you my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. God says to him: And wherefore was I sent to come hither, and you plead against me? For I was commanded by my Father not to take your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>; but if not, (then) give me your most greatly desired <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>10. And Sedrach says to God: And whence do You intend to take my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and from which limb? And God says to him: Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is placed in the midst of your lungs and your heart and is dispersed into all your limbs? It is brought up through the throat and gullet and the mouth and at whatever hour it is <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> to come forth, it is scattered, and brought together from the points of the nails and from all the limbs, and there is a great necessity that it should be separated from the body and parted from the heart. When Sedrach had heard all these things and had considered the memory of death he was greatly astounded, and Sedrach said to God: O Lord, give me a little respite that I may weep, for I have heard that tears are able to do much and much remedy comes to the lowly body of your creature.</p>

<p>11. And weeping and bewailing he began to say: O marvellous head of heavenly adornment: O radiant as the sun which shines on heaven and earth: your hairs are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from Teman, your eyes from Bosor, your ears from thunder, your tongue from a trumpet, and your brain is a small creation, your head the energy of the whole body: O friendly and most fair beloved by all, and now falling into the earth it must become forgotten. O hands, mild, fair-fingered, worn with toil by which the body is nourished: O hands, deftest of all, heaping up from all quarters you made ready houses. O fingers adorned and decked with gold and silver (rings): and great worlds are led by the fingers: the three joints enfold the palms, and heap up beautiful things: and now you must become aliens to the world. O feet, skilfully walking about, self-running, most swift, unconquerable: O knees, fitted together, because without you the body does not move: the feet run along with the sun and the moon in the night and in the day, heaping up all things, foods and drinks, and nourishing the body: O feet, most swift and fair runners, moving on the face of the earth, getting ready the house with every good thing: O feet which bear up the whole body, that run up to the temples, making repentance and calling on the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and now you are to remain motionless. O head and hands and feet, until now I have kept you. O <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, what sent you into the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and wretched body? And now being separated from it, you are going up where the Lord calls you, and the wretched body goes away to judgment. O body well-adorned, hair clothed with stars, head of heavenly adornment and dress: O face well-anointed, light-bringing eyes, voice trumpet-like, tongue placable, chin fairly adorned, hairs like the stars, head high as heaven, body decked out, light-bringing eyes that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things&mdash; and now you shall fall into the earth and under the earth your beauty shall disappear.</p>

<p>12. Christ says to him: Stay, Sedrach; how long do you weep and groan? Paradise is opened to you, and, dying, you shall live. Sedrach says to him: Once more I will speak unto you, O Lord: How long shall I live before I die? And do not disregard my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The Lord says to him: Speak, O Sedrach. Sedrach says: If a man shall live eighty or ninety or an hundred years, and live these years in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and again shall turn, and the man live in repentance, in how many days do you forgive him his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? God says to him: If he shall live an hundred or eighty years and shall turn and repent for three years and do the fruit of righteousness, and death shall overtake him, I will not remember all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>13. Sedrach says to him: The three years are a long time, my Lord, lest death overtake him and he fulfil not his repentance: have mercy, Lord, on your image and have compassion, for the three years are many. God says to him: If a man live an hundred years and remember his death and confess before men and I find him, after a time I will forgive all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Sedrach says again: I will again beseech your compassion for your creature. The time is long lest death overtake him and snatch him suddenly. The Saviour says to him: I will ask you one word, Sedrach, my beloved, then you shall ask me in turn: if the man shall repent for forty days I will not remember all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he did.</p>

<p>14. And Sedrach says  to the archangel Michael: Hearken to me, O powerful chief, and help me and be my envoy that God may have mercy on the world. And falling on their faces, they besought the Lord and said: O Lord, teach us how and by what sort of repentance and by what labour man shall be saved. God says: By repentances, by intercessions, by liturgies, by tears in streams, in hot groanings. Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that my <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> David was saved by tears, and the rest were saved in one moment? You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, Sedrach, that there are nations which have not the law and which do the works of the law: for if they are unbaptized and my divine spirit come unto them and they turn to my <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, I also receive them with my righteous ones into <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom. And there are some who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with my <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and who have shared in my divine part and become reprobate in complete reprobation and will not repent: and I suffer them with much compassion and much pity and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> <span class="stiki" id="note093989"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;2:4</a></span> in order that they may repent, but they do the things which my divinity <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>, and did not hearken to the wise man asking (them), saying, we by no means justify a sinner. Do you not most certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is written: And those who repent never see chastisement? And they did not hearken to the Apostles or to my word in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, and they grieve my <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and verily they do not attend to my messenger in the assemblies (for communion) and in my services, and they do not stand in my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches, but they stand and do not fall down and worship in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling, but boast things which I do not accept, or my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<p>15. Sedrach says to God: O Lord, You alone are sinless and very compassionate, having compassion and pity for sinners, but your divinity said: I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. And the Lord said to Sedrach: Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, Sedrach, that the thief was saved in one moment to repent? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that my apostle and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> was saved in one moment? <q> <em>Peccatores enim non salvantur</em>,</q> for their hearts are like rotten stone: these are they who walk in impious ways and who shall be destroyed with <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. Sedrach says: O my Lord, You also said: My divine spirit entered into the nations which, not having the law, do the things of the law. So also the thief and the apostle and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> and the rest of those who have already got into your Kingdom. O my Lord; so likewise do You pardon those who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> to the last: for life is very toilsome and there is no time for repentance.</p>

<p>16. The Lord says to Sedrach: I made man in three stages: when he is young, I overlooked his stumblings as he was young: and again when he was a man I considered his purpose: and again when he grows old, I watch him till he repent. Sedrach says: O Lord, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and understandest all these things: but have sympathy for sinners. The Lord says to him: Sedrach, my beloved, I promise to have sympathy and bring down the forty days to twenty: and whosoever shall remember your name shall not see the place of chastisement, but shall be with the just in a place of refreshment and rest: and if anyone shall record this wonderful word his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shall not be reckoned against him for ever and ever.  And Sedrach says: O Lord, and if anyone shall bring enlightenment to your servant, save him, O Lord, from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And Sedrach, the servant of the Lord, says: Now take my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, O Lord. And God took him and placed him in Paradise with all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. To whom be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the power for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
