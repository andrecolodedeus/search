<h1>The Apostolic Canons</h1>


<h2>Canon 1</h2> 

<p>Let a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be ordained by two or three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 2</h2>

<p>Let a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, be ordained by one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>,</p>

<h2>Canon 3 (3 and 4)</h2>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> offer any other things at the altar, besides that which the Lord ordained for the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, as honey, or milk, or strong-made drink instead of wine,  or birds, or any living things, or vegetables, besides that which is ordained, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>. Excepting only new ears of grain, and grapes at the suitable season. Neither is it allowed to bring anything else to the altar at the time of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oblation, excepting oil for the lamps, and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 4 (5)</h2>

<p>Let all other fruits be sent home as <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, but not offered at the altar. But the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> should of course give a share of these things to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 5 (6)</h2>

<p>Let not a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">put away</a> his wife under pretence of religion; but if he put her away, let him be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>; and if he persists, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 6 (7)</h2>

<p>Let not a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, undertake worldly business; otherwise let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 7 (8)</h2>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, shall celebrate the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> before the vernal equinox, with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 8 (9)</h2>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or any one on the sacerdotal list, when the offering is made, does not partake of it, let him declare the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and if it be a reasonable one, let him be excused; but if he does not declare it, let him be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, as being a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of offense to the people, and occasioning a suspicion against the offerer, as if he had not made the offering properly.</p>

<h2>Canon 9 (10)</h2>

<p>All the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who come in and hear the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, but do not stay for the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and the Holy Communion, are to be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, as causing disorder in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 10 (11)</h2>

<p>If any one shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, even in a private house, with an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> person, let him also be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 11 (12)</h2>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> shall join in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with a deposed <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, as if he were a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>,  let him also be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 12 and 13 (13)</h2>

<p>If any one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> who is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, or not to be received, shall go away, and be received in another city without commendatory letters, let both the receiver and the received be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.</p>

<p>But if he be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> already, let the time of his excommunication be lengthened.</p>

<h2>Canon 14</h2>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is not to be allowed to leave his own parish, and pass over into another, although he may be pressed by many to do so, unless there be some proper <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> constraining him, as if he can confer some greater benefit upon the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of that place in the word of godliness. And this must be done not of his own accord, but by the judgment of many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and at their earnest exhortation.</p>

<h2>Canon 15</h2>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or any other of the list of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, shall leave his own parish, and go into another, and having entirely forsaken his own, shall make his abode in the other parish without the permission of his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, we ordain that he shall no longer perform divine service; more especially if his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> having exhorted him to return he has refused to do so, and persists in his disorderly conduct. But let him communicate there as a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 16</h2>

<p>If, however, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, with whom any such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are staying, shall disregard the command that they are to cease from performing divine offices, and shall receive them as clergymen, let him be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, as a teacher of disorder.</p>

<h2>Canon 17</h2>

<p>He who has been twice married after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or who has had a concubine, cannot become a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or any other of the sacerdotal list.</p>

<h2>Canon 18</h2>

<p>He who married a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, or an harlot, or a servant-maid, or an actress, cannot be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or any other of the sacerdotal list.</p>

<h2>Canon 19</h2>

<p>He who has married two sisters, or a niece, cannot become a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 20</h2>

<p>If a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> becomes surety for any one, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 21</h2>

<p>An eunuch, if he has been made so by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of men or [if his <em>virilia</em> have been amputated ] in times of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, or if he has been born so, if in other respects he is worthy, may be made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 22</h2>

<p>He who has mutilated himself, cannot become a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, for he is a self-murderer, and an enemy to the workmanship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 23</h2>

<p>If any man being a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> shall mutilate himself, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, for he is a self-murderer.</p>

<h2>Canon 24</h2>

<p>If a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> mutilate himself, let him be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for three years, as practising against his own life.</p>

<h2>Canon 25 (25 and 26)</h2>

<p>If a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> be found guilty of fornication, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, or theft, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, but let him not be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>; for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>you shall not punish a man twice for the same offense.</q> In like manner the other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> shall be subject to the same proceeding. </p>

<h2>Canon 26 (27)</h2>

<p>Of those who have been admitted to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> unmarried, we ordain, that the readers and <a href="../cathen/03306a.htm">singers</a> only may, if they will, marry.</p>

<h2>Canon 27 (28)</h2>

<p>If a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> shall strike any of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, or of the unbelievers who have done wrong, with the intention of frightening them, we command that he be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>. For our Lord has by no means taught us to do so, but, on the contrary, when he was smitten he smote not again, when he was reviled he reviled not again, when he suffered he threatened not.</p>

<h2>Canon 28 (29)</h2>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, having been <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> deposed upon open accusations, shall dare to meddle with any of the divine offices which had been entrusted to him, let him be altogether cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 29 (30)</h2>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, shall obtain possession of that dignity by money, let both him and the person who ordained him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, and also altogether cut off from all communion, as <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> was by me <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 30 (31)</h2>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> obtain possession of a church by the aid of the temporal powers, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, and all who communicate with him.</p>

<h2>Canon 31 (32)</h2>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, despising his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, shall collect a separate congregation, and erect another altar, not having any grounds for condemning the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with regard to religion or <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> for his ambition; for he is a tyrant; in like manner also the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and as many as join him; and let <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Let this, however, be done after a first, second, and third admonition from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 32 (33)</h2>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> has been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he may not be received into communion again by any other than by him who <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him, unless it happen that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him be dead.</p>

<h2>Canon 33 (34)</h2>

<p>No foreign <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, may be received without commendatory letters; and when they are produced let the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> be examined; and if they be preachers of godliness, let them be received. Otherwise, although you supply them with what they need, you must not receive them into communion, for many things are done surreptitiously.</p>

<h2>Canon 34 (35)</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of every nation must acknowledge him who is first among them and account him as their head, and do nothing of consequence without his consent; but each may do those things only which concern his own parish, and the country places which belong to it. But neither let him (who is the first) do anything without the consent of all; for so there will be unanimity, and God will be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> through the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. </p>

<h2>Canon 35 (36)</h2>

<p>Let not a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> dare to ordain beyond his own limits, in cities and places not subject to him. But if he be convicted of doing so, without the consent of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have authority over such cities and places, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, and those also whom he has ordained.</p>

<h2>Canon 36 (37)</h2>

<p>If any person, having been ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, does not undertake the ministry, and the care of the people committed to him, let him be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> until he does undertake it. In like manner a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. But if he has gone and has not been received, not of his own will but from the perverseness of the people, let him continue <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; and let the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the city be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, because they have not corrected the disobedient people.</p>

<h2>Canon 37 (38)</h2>

<p>Let there be a meeting of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> twice a year, and let them examine among themselves the decrees concerning religion and settle the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> controversies which may have occurred. One meeting to be held in the fourth week of Pentecost [i.e., the fourth week after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>], and the other on the 12th day of the month Hyperberet&aelig;us [i.e., October].</p>

<h2>Canon 38 (39)</h2>

<p>Let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> have the care of all the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and let him administer them as under the inspection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But he must not alienate any of them or give the things which belong to God to his own relations. If they be poor let him relieve them as poor; but let him not, under that pretence, sell the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 39 (40)</h2>

<p>Let not the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> do anything without the sanction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; for he it is who is entrusted with the people of the Lord, and of whom will be required the account of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 40 (40 Continued.)</h2>

<p>Let the private goods of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, if he have any such, and those of the Lord, be clearly distinguished, that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may have the power of leaving his own goods, when he dies, to whom he will, and how he will, and that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> own property may not be lost under pretence of its being the property of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: for it may be that he has a wife, or children, or relations, or servants; and it is just before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that neither should the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> suffer any loss through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> own property, nor the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or his relations be injured under pretext of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: nor that those who belong to him should be involved in contests, and cast reproaches upon his death.</p>

<h2>Canon 41</h2>

<p>We ordain that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> have authority over the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: for if he is to be entrusted with the precious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, much more are temporal possessions to be entrusted to him. He is therefore to administer them all of his own authority, and supply those who need, through the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with all reverence. He may also, if need be, take what is required for his own necessary wants, and for the brethren to whom he has to show hospitality, so that he may not be in any want. For the law of God has ordained, that they who wait at the altar should be nourished  of the altar. Neither does any soldier bear arms against an enemy at his own cost.</p>

<h2>Canon 42</h2>

<p>If a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, is addicted to dice or drinking, let him either give it over, or be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 43</h2>

<p>If a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, reader, or singer, commits the same things, let him either give over, or be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. So also <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 44</h2>

<h2>Canon 73</h2>

<p>Let no one convert to his own use any vessel of gold or silver, or any veil which has been sanctified, for it is contrary to law; and if anyone be detected doing so, let him be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 74</h2>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has been accused of anything by men worthy of credit, he must be summoned by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; and if he appears, and confesses, or is convicted, a suitable punishment must be inflicted upon him. But if when he is summoned he does not attend, let him be summoned a second time, two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> being sent to him, for that purpose. [If even then he will not attend, let him be summoned a third time, two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> being again sent to him. ] But if even then he shall disregard the summons and not come, let the synod pronounce such sentence against him as appears right, that he may not seem to profit by avoiding judgment.</p>

<h2>Canon 75</h2>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> is not to be received as <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, neither only one believer; for <q>in the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word shall be established.</q></p>

<h2>Canon 76</h2>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must not out of favour to a brother or a son, or any other relation, ordain whom he will to the episcopal dignity; for it is not right to make heirs of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>, giving the things of God to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affections. Neither is it fitting to subject the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> to heirs. But if anyone shall do so let the ordination be void, and the ordainer himself be punished with excommunication.</p>

<h2>Canon 77</h2>

<p>If any one be deprived of an eye, or lame of a leg, but in other respects be worthy of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>, he may be ordained, for the defect of the body does not defile a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but the pollution of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 78</h2>

<p>But if a man be deaf or blind, he may not be made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, not indeed as if he were thus defiled, but that the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may not be hindered.</p>

<h2>Canon 79</h2>

<p>If anyone <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">has a devil</a>, let him not be made a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, neither let him <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>; but if he be freed, let him be received into communion, and if he is worthy he may be ordained.</p>

<h2>Canon 80</h2>

<p>It is not allowed that a man who has come over from a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> life, and been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> or who has been converted from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> course of living, should be immediately made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, for it is not right that he who has not been tried himself should be a teacher of others. Unless indeed this be done upon a special manifestation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> in his favour.</p>

<h2>Canon 81</h2>

<p>We have said that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> must not give himself to the management of public affairs, but devote himself to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> business. Let him then be persuaded to do so, or let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, for no man can serve two masters, according to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord's</a> declaration.</p>

<h2>Canon 82</h2>

<p>We do not allow any servants to be promoted to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> without the consent of their masters, [to the troubling of their houses. ] But if any servant should appear worthy of receiving an order,  as our Onesimus appeared, and his masters agree and liberate him, and send him out of their house, he may be ordained.</p>

<h2>Canon 83</h2>

<p>If a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, shall serve in the army, and wish to retain both the Roman magistracy and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>; for the things of C&aelig;sar belong to C&aelig;sar, and those of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Canon 84</h2>

<p>Whosoever shall insult the King, or a ruler, contrary to what is right, let him suffer punishment. If he be a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>; if a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.</p>
