<h1>The Chaplet</h1>

<p> <em>The Chaplet, or De Corona. </em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>Very lately it happened thus: while the bounty of our most excellent emperors  was dispensed in the camp, the soldiers, laurel-crowned, were approaching. One of them, more a soldier of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, more steadfast than the rest of his brethren, who had imagined that they could serve two masters, his head alone uncovered, the useless crown in his hand&mdash; already even by that peculiarity <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to every one as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>&mdash; was nobly conspicuous. Accordingly, all began to mark him out, jeering him at a distance, gnashing on him near at hand. The murmur is wafted to the tribune, when the person had just left the ranks. The tribune at once puts the question to him, Why are you so different in your attire? He declared that he had no liberty to wear the crown with the rest. Being urgently asked for his reasons, he answered, I am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. O soldier! Boasting yourself in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Then the case was considered and voted on; the matter was remitted to a higher tribunal; the offender was conducted to the prefects. At once he put away the heavy cloak, his disburdening commenced; he loosed from his foot the military shoe, beginning to stand upon <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ground;  he gave up the sword, which was not necessary either for the protection of our Lord; from his hand likewise dropped the laurel crown; and now, purple-clad with the hope of his own blood, shod with the preparation of the gospel, girt with the sharper word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, completely equipped in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> armour, and crowned more worthily with the white crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, he awaits in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> the largess of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Thereafter adverse judgments began to be passed upon his conduct&mdash; whether on the part of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, for those of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> are not different&mdash; as if he were headstrong and rash, and too eager to die, because, in being taken to task about a mere matter of dress, he brought trouble on the bearers of the Name, &mdash; he, forsooth, alone brave among so many soldier-brethren, he alone a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. It is plain that as they have rejected the prophecies of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,  they are also purposing the refusal of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. So they murmur that a peace so good and long is endangered for them. Nor do I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that some are already turning their back on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, are making ready their luggage, are equipped for flight from city to city; for that is all of the gospel they care to remember. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, too, their pastors are lions in peace, deer in the fight. As to the questions asked for extorting confessions from us, we shall teach elsewhere. Now, as they put forth also the objection&mdash; But where are we forbidden to be crowned?&mdash; I shall take this point up, as more suitable to be treated of here, being the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, in fact, of the present contention. So that, on the one hand, the inquirers who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, but anxious, may be instructed; and on the other, those may be refuted who try to vindicate the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, especially the laurel-crowned <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> themselves, to whom it is merely a question of debate, as if it might be regarded as either no trespass at all, or at least a doubtful one, because it may be made the subject of investigation. That it is neither sinless nor doubtful, I shall now, however, show.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>I affirm that not one of the Faithful has ever a crown upon his head, except at a time of trial. That is the case with all, from <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> to confessors and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>,  or (as the case may be) deniers. Consider, then, whence the custom about which we are now chiefly inquiring got its authority. But when the question is raised why it is observed, it is meanwhile evident that it is observed. Therefore that can neither be regarded as no offense, or an uncertain one, which is perpetrated against a practice which is capable of defence, on the ground even of its repute, and is sufficiently ratified by the support of general acceptance. It is undoubted, so that we ought to inquire into the reason of the thing; but without prejudice to the practice, not for the purpose of overthrowing it, but rather of building it up, that you may all the more carefully observe it, when you are also satisfied as to its reason. But what sort of procedure is it, for one to be bringing into debate a practice, when he has fallen from it, and to be seeking the explanation of his having ever had it, when he has left it off? Since, although he may wish to seem on this account desirous to investigate it, that he may show that he has not done wrong in giving it up, it is evident that he nevertheless transgressed previously in its presumptuous observance. If he has done no wrong today in accepting the crown he offended before in refusing it. This treatise, therefore, will not be for those who not in a proper condition for inquiry, but for those who, with the real desire of getting instruction, bring forward, not a question for debate, but a request for advice. For it is from this desire that a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> inquiry always proceeds; and I praise the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the duty of complying with the rule, before it has learned the reason of it. An easy thing it is at once to demand where it is written that we should not be crowned. But is it written that we should be crowned? Indeed, in urgently demanding the warrant of Scripture in a different side from their own, men prejudge that the support of Scripture ought no less to appear on their part. For if it shall be said that it is lawful to be crowned on this ground, that Scripture does not forbid it, it will as validly be retorted that just on this ground is the crown unlawful, because the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> does not enjoin it. What shall discipline do? Shall it accept both things, as if neither were forbidden? Or shall it refuse both, as if neither were enjoined? But <q>the thing which is not forbidden is freely permitted.</q> I should rather say  that what has not been freely allowed is forbidden.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>And how long shall we draw the saw to and fro through this line, when we have an ancient practice, which by anticipation has made for us the state, i.e., of the question? If no passage of Scripture has prescribed it, assuredly custom, which without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> flowed from tradition, has confirmed it. For how can anything come into use, if it has not first been handed down? Even in pleading tradition, written authority, you say, must be demanded. Let us inquire, therefore, whether tradition, unless it be written, should not be admitted. Certainly we shall say that it ought not to be admitted, if no cases of other practices which, without any written instrument, we maintain on the ground of tradition alone, and the countenance thereafter of custom, affords us any precedent. To deal with this matter briefly, I shall begin with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.  When we are going to enter the water, but a little before, in the presence of the congregation and under the hand of the president, we solemnly profess that we disown the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and his pomp, and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Hereupon we are thrice immersed, making a somewhat ampler pledge than the Lord has appointed in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Then when we are taken up (as new-born children),  we taste first of all a mixture of milk and honey, and from that day we refrain from the daily bath for a whole week. We take also, in congregations before daybreak, and from the hand of none but the presidents, the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, which the Lord both commanded to be eaten at meal-times, and enjoined to be taken by all alike.  As often as the anniversary comes round, we make offerings for the dead as birthday honours. We count <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> or kneeling in worship on the Lord's day to be unlawful. We <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the same privilege also from <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> to Whitsunday. We feel pained should any wine or bread, even though our own, be cast upon the ground. At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign. </p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>If, for these and other such rules, you insist upon having positive Scripture injunction, you will find none. Tradition will be held forth to you as the originator of them, custom as their strengthener, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as their observer. That reason will support tradition, and custom, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, you will either yourself perceive, or learn from some one who has. Meanwhile you will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is some reason to which submission is due. I add still one case more, as it will be proper to show you how it was among the ancients also. Among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, so usual is it for their <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to have the head veiled, that they may thereby be recognised. I ask in this instance for the law. I put the apostle aside. If Rebecca at once drew down her veil, when in the distance she saw her <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, this modesty of a mere private individual could not have made a law, or it will have made it only for those who have the reason which she had. Let <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> alone be veiled, and this when they are coming to be married, and not till they have recognised their destined husband. If Susanna also, who was subjected to unveiling on her trial,  furnishes an argument for the veiling of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, I can say here also, the veil was a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> thing. She had come accused, ashamed of the disgrace she had brought on herself, properly concealing her beauty, even because now she feared to please. But I should not suppose that, when it was her aim to please, she took walks with a veil on in her husband's avenue. Grant, now, that she was always veiled. In this particular case, too, or, in fact, in that of any other, I demand the dress-law. If I nowhere find a law, it follows that tradition has given the fashion in question to custom, to find subsequently (its authorization in) the apostle's sanction, from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> interpretation of reason. This instances, therefore, will make it sufficiently plain that you can vindicate the keeping of even unwritten tradition established by custom; the proper <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> for tradition when demonstrated by long-continued observance.  But even in civil matters custom is accepted as law, when positive legal enactment is wanting; and it is the same thing whether it depends on writing or on reason, since reason is, in fact, the basis of law. But, (you say), if reason is the ground of law, all will now henceforth have to be counted law, whoever brings it forward, which shall have reason as its ground.  Or do you think that every believer is entitled to originate and establish a law, if only it be such as is agreeable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as is helpful to discipline, as promotes <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, when the Lord says, <q>But why do you not even of your own selves judge what is right?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030394"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse27">Luke&nbsp;12:27</a></span> And not merely in regard to a judicial sentence, but in regard to every decision in matters we are called on to consider, the apostle also says, <q>If of anything you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, God shall reveal it unto you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030395"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> he himself, too, being accustomed to afford counsel though he had not the command of the Lord, and to dictate of himself  as possessing the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> who guides into all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore his advice has, by the warrant of divine reason, become equivalent to nothing less than a divine command. Earnestly now inquire of this teacher,  keeping intact your regard for tradition, from whomsoever it originally sprang; nor have regard to the author, but to the authority, and especially that of custom itself, which on this very account we should revere, that we may not want an interpreter; so that if reason too is God's gift, you may then learn, not whether custom has to be followed by you, but why.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>The argument for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> practices becomes all the stronger, when also nature, which is the first rule of all, supports them. Well, she is the first who lays it down that a crown does not become the head. But I think ours is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of nature, who fashioned man; and, that he might desire, (appreciate, become partaker of) the pleasures afforded by His creatures, endowed him with certain senses, (acting) through members, which, so to speak, are their peculiar instruments. The sense of hearing he has planted in the ears; that of sight, lighted up in the eyes; that of taste, shut up in the mouth; that of smell, wafted into the nose; that of touch, fixed in the tips of the fingers. By means of these organs of the outer man doing duty to the inner man, the enjoyments of the divine gifts are conveyed by the senses to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.  What, then, in flowers affords you enjoyment? For it is the flowers of the field which are the peculiar, at least the chief, material of crowns. Either smell, you say, or colour, or both together. What will be the senses of colour and smell? Those of seeing and smelling, I suppose. What members have had these senses allotted to them? The eyes and the nose, if I am not mistaken. With sight and smell, then, make use of flowers, for these are the senses by which they are meant to be enjoyed; use them by means of the eyes and nose, which are the members to which these senses belong. You have got the thing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the mode of it from the world; but an extraordinary mode does not prevent the use of the thing in the common way. Let flowers, then, both when fastened into each other and tied together in thread and rush, be what they are when free, when loose&mdash; things to be looked at and smelt. You count it a crown, let us say, when you have a bunch of them bound together in a series, that you may carry many at one time that you may enjoy them all at once. Well, lay them in your bosom if they are so singularly pure, and strew them on your couch if they are so exquisitely soft, and consign them to your cup if they are so perfectly harmless. Have the pleasure of them in as many ways as they appeal to your senses. But what taste for a flower, what sense for anything belonging to a crown but its band, have you in the head, which is able neither to distinguish colour, nor to inhale sweet perfumes, nor to appreciate softness? It is as much against nature to long after a flower with the head, as it is to crave food with the ear, or sound with the nostril. But everything which is against nature deserves to be branded as monstrous among all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; but with us it is to be condemned also as sacrilege against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Lord and Creator of nature.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>Demanding then a law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have that common one prevailing all over the world, engraven on the natural tables to which the apostle too is wont to appeal, as when in respect of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> veil he says, <q>Does not even Nature teach you?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030399"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:14</a></span> &mdash; as when to the Romans, affirming that the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> do by nature those things which the law requires, <span class="stiki" id="note030400"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;2:14</a></span> he suggests both natural law and a law-revealing nature. Yes, and also in the first chapter of the epistle he authenticates nature, when he asserts that males and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> changed among themselves the natural use of the creature into that which is unnatural, <span class="stiki" id="note030401"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse26">Romans&nbsp;1:26</a></span> by way of penal retribution for their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. We first of all indeed <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God Himself by the teaching of Nature, calling Him God of gods, taking for granted that He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and invoking Him as Judge. Is it a question with you whether for the enjoyment of His creatures, Nature should be our guide, that we may not be carried away in the direction in which the rival of God has corrupted, along with man himself, the entire creation which had been made over to our race for certain uses, whence the apostle says that it too unwillingly became subject to vanity, completely bereft of its original character, first by vain, then by base, unrighteous, and ungodly uses? It is thus, accordingly, in the pleasures of the shows, that the creature is dishonoured by those who by nature indeed perceive that all the materials of which shows are got up belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but lack the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to perceive as well that they have all been changed by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. But with this topic we have, for the sake of our own play-lovers, sufficiently dealt, and that, too, in a work in Greek. </p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>Let these dealers in crowns then recognize in the meantime the authority of Nature, on the ground of a common sense as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, and the certifications of their peculiar religion, as, according to the last chapter, worshippers of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of nature; and, as it were, thus over and above what is required, let them consider those other reasons too which forbid us wearing crowns, especially on the head, and indeed crowns of every sort. For we are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to turn from the rule of Nature, which we share with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> in general, that we may maintain the whole peculiarity of our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> discipline, in relation also to other kinds of crowns which seem to have been provided for different uses, as being composed of different substances, lest, because they do not consist of flowers, the use of which nature has indicated (as it does in the case of this military laurel one itself), they may be thought not to come under the prohibition of our <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, since they have escaped any objections of nature. I see, then, that we must go into the matter both with more research, and more fully, from its beginnings on through its successive stages of growth to its more erratic developments. For this we need to turn to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> literature, for things belonging to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> must be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from their own documents. The little of this I have acquired, will, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, be enough. If there really was a Pandora, whom Hesiod mentions as the first of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, hers was the first head the graces crowned, for she received gifts from all <em>the gods</em> whence she got <em>her name</em> Pandora. But <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, not a poet-shepherd, shows us the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> Eve having her loins more naturally girt about with leaves than her temples with flowers. Pandora, then, is a myth. And so we have to blush for the origin of the crown, even on the ground of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> connected with it; and, as will soon appear, on the ground no less of its realities. For it is an undoubted fact that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> either originated the thing, or shed lustre on it. Pherecydes relates that Saturn was the first who wore a crown; Diodorus, that Jupiter, after conquering the Titans, was honoured with this gift by the rest of the gods. To Priapus also the same author assigns fillets; and to Ariadne a garland of gold and of Indian gems, the gift of Vulcan, afterwards of Bacchus, and subsequently turned into a constellation. Callimachus has put a vine crown upon Juno. So too at Argos, her <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, vine-wreathed, with a lion's skin placed beneath her feet, exhibits the stepmother exulting over the spoils of her two step-sons. Hercules displays upon his head sometimes poplar, sometimes wild-olive, sometimes parsley. You have the tragedy of Cerberus; you have Pindar; and besides Callimachus, who mentions that Apollo, too when he had killed the Delphic serpent, as a suppliant, put on a laurel garland; for among the ancients suppliants were wont to be crowned. Harpocration argues that Bacchus the same as Osiris among the Egyptians, was designedly crowned with ivy, because it is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of ivy to protect the brain against drowsiness. But that in another way also Bacchus was the originator of the laurel crown (the crown) in which he celebrated his triumph over the Indians, even the rabble acknowledge, when they call the days dedicated to him the <q>great crown.</q> If you open, again, the writings of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Leo, you learn that Isis was the first who discovered and wore ears of grain upon her head&mdash; a thing more suited to the belly. Those who want additional information will find an ample exposition of the subject in Claudius Saturninus, a writer of distinguished talent who treats this question also, for he has a book on crowns, so explaining their beginnings as well as causes, and kinds, and <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, that you find all that is charming in the flower, all that is beautiful in the leafy branch, and every sod or vine-shoot has been dedicated to some head or other; making it abundantly clear how foreign to us we should judge the custom of the crowned head, introduced as it was by, and thereafter constantly managed for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of, those whom the world has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be gods. If the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, a liar from the beginning, is even in this matter working for his false system of godhead (<a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>), he had himself also without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> provided for his god-lie being carried out. What sort of thing, then, must that be counted among the people of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which was brought in by the nations in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> candidates, and was set apart from the beginning to no other than these; and which even then received its consecration to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> by <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and in <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> yet alive? Not as if an idol were anything, but since the things which others offer up to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> belong to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. But if the things which <em>others</em> offer to them belong to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> how much more what <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> offered to themselves, when they were in life! The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> themselves, doubtless, had made provision for themselves by means of those whom they had possessed, while in a state of desire and craving, before provision had been actually made.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>Hold fast in the meantime this persuasion, while I examine a question which comes in our way. For I already hear it is said, that many other things as well as crowns have been invented by those whom the world believes to be gods, and that they are notwithstanding to be met with both in our present usages and in those of early <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and in the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in Christ Himself, who did His work as man by no other than these ordinary instrumentalities of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. Well, let it be so; nor shall I inquire any further back into the origin of this things. Let Mercury have been the first who taught the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of letters; I will own that they are requisite both for the business and commerce of life, and for performing our devotion to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nay, if he also first strung the chord to give forth melody, I will not deny, when listening to David, that this invention has been in use with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and has ministered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Let &AElig;sculapius have been the first who sought and discovered cures: Esaias <span class="stiki" id="note030403"><a href="../bible/isa038.htm#verse21">Isaiah&nbsp;38:21</a></span> mentions that he ordered Hezekiah medicine when he was sick. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, too, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that a little wine does the stomach good. <span class="stiki" id="note030404"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:23</a></span> Let Minerva have been the first who built a ship: I shall see Jonah and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> sailing. Nay, there is more than this: for even Christ, we shall find, has ordinary raiment;  <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, too, has his cloak.  If at once, of every article of furniture and each household vessel, you name some god of the world as the originator, well, I must recognise Christ, both as He reclines on a couch, and when He presents a basin for the feet of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and when He pours water into it from a ewer, and when He is girt about with a linen towel <span class="stiki" id="note030406"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;13:1-5</a></span> &mdash; a garment specially sacred to Osiris. It is thus in general I reply upon the point, admitting indeed that we use along with others these articles, but challenging that this be judged in the light of the distinction between things agreeable and things opposed to reason, because the promiscuous employment of them is deceptive, concealing the corruption of the creature, by which it has been made subject to vanity. For we affirm that those things only are proper to be used, whether by ourselves or by those who lived before us, and alone befit the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Christ Himself, which to meet the necessities of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life supply what is simply; useful and affords real assistance and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> comfort, so that they may be well <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have come from God's own inspiration, who first of all no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> provided for and taught and ministered to the enjoyment, I should suppose, of His own man. As for the things which are out of this class, they are not fit to be used among us, especially those which on that account indeed are not to be found either with the world, or in the ways of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>In short, what patriarch, what <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, what Levite, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or ruler, or at a later period what apostle, or preacher of the gospel, or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, do you ever find the wearer of a crown?  I think not even the temple of God itself was crowned; as neither was the ark of the testament, nor the tabernacle of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, nor the altar, nor the candlestick crowned though certainly, both on that first <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of the dedication, and in that second rejoicing for the restoration, crowning would have been most suitable if it were worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if these things were figures of us (for we are temples of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and altars, and lights, and sacred vessels), this too they in figure set forth, that the people of God ought not to be crowned. The reality must always correspond with the image. If, perhaps, you object that Christ Himself was crowned, to that you will get the brief reply: Be you too crowned, as He was; you have full permission. Yet even that crown of insolent ungodliness was not of any decree of the Jewish people. It was a device of the Roman soldiers, taken from the practice of the world&mdash;a practice which the people of God never allowed either on the occasion of public rejoicing or to gratify innate luxury: so they returned from the Babylonish captivity with timbrels, and flutes, and psalteries, more suitably than with crowns; and after eating and drinking, uncrowned, they rose up to play. Neither would the account of the rejoicing nor the exposure of the luxury have been silent touching the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> or dishonour of the crown. Thus too Isaiah, as he says, <q>With timbrels, and psalteries, and flutes they drink wine,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030408"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;5:12</a></span> would have added <q>with crowns,</q> if this practice had ever had place in the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>So, when you allege that the ornaments of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> deities are found no less with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with the object of claiming among these for general use the head-crown, you already lay it down for yourself, that we must not have among us, as a thing whose use we are to share with others, what is not to be found in the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Well, what is so unworthy of God indeed as that which is worthy of an idol? But what is so worthy of an idol as that which is also worthy of a dead man? For it is the privilege of the dead also to be thus crowned, as they too straightway become <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, both by their dress and the service of deification, which (deification) is with us a second <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Wanting, then, the sense, it will be theirs to use the thing for which the sense is wanting, just as if in full possession of the sense they wished to abuse it. When there ceases to be any reality in the use, there is no distinction between using and abusing. Who can abuse a thing, when the precipient nature with which he wishes to carry out his purpose is not his to use it? The apostle, moreover, forbids us to abuse, while he would more naturally have taught us not to use, unless on the ground that, where there is no sense for things, there is no wrong use of them. But the whole affair is meaningless, and is, in fact, a dead work so far as concerns the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; though, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, a living one as respects the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>  to whom the religious rite belongs. <q>The <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>,</q> says David, <q>are silver and gold.</q> <q>They have eyes, and see not; a nose, and smell not; hands, and they will not handle.</q>  By means of these organs, indeed, we are to enjoy flowers; but if he declares that those who make <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> will be like them, they already are so who use anything after the style of idol adornings. <q>To the pure all things are pure: so, likewise, all things to the impure are impure;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030411"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse15">Titus&nbsp;1:15</a></span> but nothing is more impure than <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. The substances are themselves as creatures of God without impurity, and in this their native state are free to the use of all; but the ministries to which in their use they are devoted, makes all the difference; for I, too, kill a cock for myself, just as Socrates did for &AElig;sculapius; and if the smell of some place or other offends me, I burn the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> product myself, but not with the same ceremony, nor in the same dress, nor with the same pomp, with which it is done to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.  If the creature is defiled by a mere word, as the apostle teaches, <q>But if any one say, This is offered in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, you must not touch it,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030413"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:28</a></span> much more when it is polluted by the dress, and <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, and pomp of what is offered to the gods. Thus the crown also is made out to be an offering to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>;  for with this ceremony, and dress, and pomp, it is presented in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, its originators, to whom its use is specially given over, and chiefly on this account, that what has no place among the things of God may not be admitted into use with us as with others. Wherefore the apostle exclaims, <q>Flee <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030415"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:14</a></span> certainly <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> whole and entire he means. Reflect on what a thicket it is, and how many thorns lie hidden in it. Nothing must be given to an idol, and so nothing must be taken from one. If it is inconsistent with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to recline in an idol temple, what is it to appear in an idol dress? What communion have Christ and <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>? Therefore flee from it; for he enjoins us to keep at a distance from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>&mdash; to have no close dealings with it of any kind. Even an earthly serpent sucks in men at some distance with its breath. Going still further, John says, <q>My little children, keep yourselves from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030416"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:21</a></span> &mdash; not now from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, as if from the service of it, but from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>&mdash; that is, from any resemblance to them: for it is an unworthy thing that you, the image of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, should become the likeness of an idol and a dead man. Thus far we assert, that this attire belongs to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, both from the history of its origin, and from its use by false religion; on this ground, besides, that while it is not mentioned as connected with the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is more and more given over to those in whose antiquities, as well as festivals and services, it is found. In a word, the very doors, the very victims and altars, the very servants and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, are crowned. You have, in Claudius, the crowns of all the various colleges of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. We have added also that distinction between things altogether different from each other&mdash; things, namely, agreeable, and things contrary to reason&mdash; in answer to those who, because there happens to be the use of some things in common, maintain the right of participation in all things. With reference to this part of the subject, therefore, it now remains that the special grounds for wearing crowns should be examined, that while we show these to be foreign, nay, even opposed to our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> discipline, we may demonstrate that none of them have any plea of reason to support it, on the basis of which this article of dress might be vindicated as one in whose use we can participate, as even some others may whose instances are cast up to us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>To begin with the real ground of the military crown, I think we must first inquire whether warfare is proper at all for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. What sense is there in discussing the merely accidental, when that on which it rests is to be condemned? Do we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it lawful for a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>  to be superadded to one divine, for a man to come under promise to another master after Christ, and to abjure father, mother, and all nearest kinsfolk, whom even the law has commanded us to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> next to God Himself, to whom the gospel, too, holding them only of less account than Christ, has in like manner rendered <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>? Shall it be held lawful to make an occupation of the sword, when the Lord proclaims that he who uses the sword shall perish by the sword? And shall the son of peace take part in the battle when it does not become him even to sue at law? And shall he apply the chain, and the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and the torture, and the punishment, who is not the avenger even of his own wrongs? Shall he, forsooth, either keep watch-service for others more than for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or shall he do it on the Lord's day, when he does not even do it for Christ Himself? And shall he keep guard before the temples which he has renounced? And shall he take a meal where the apostle has forbidden him? <span class="stiki" id="note030418"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:10</a></span> And shall he diligently protect by night those whom in the day-time he has put to flight by his exorcisms, leaning and resting on the spear the while with which Christ's side was pierced? Shall he carry a flag,  too, hostile to Christ? And shall <em>he</em> ask a watchword from the emperor who has already received one from God? Shall <em>he</em> be disturbed in death by the trumpet of the trumpeter, who expects to be aroused by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> trump? And shall the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> be burned according to camp rule, when he was not permitted to burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> to an idol, when to him Christ remitted the punishment of fire? Then how many other offenses there are involved in the performances of camp offices, which we must hold to involve a transgression of God's law, you may see by a slight survey. The very carrying of the name over from the camp of light to the camp of darkness is a violation of it. Of course, if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> comes later, and finds any preoccupied with military service, their case is different, as in the instance of those whom John used to receive for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and of those most faithful centurions, I mean the centurion whom Christ approves, and the centurion whom Peter instructs; yet, at the same time, when a man has become a believer, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has been sealed, there must be either an immediate abandonment of it, which has been the course with many; or all sorts of quibbling will have to be resorted to in order to avoid offending <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that is not allowed even outside of military service;  or, last of all, for God the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> must be endured which a citizen-<a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has been no less ready to accept. Neither does military service hold out escape from punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or exemption from <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Nowhere does the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> change his character. There is one gospel, and the same Jesus, who will one day deny every one who denies, and acknowledge every one who acknowledges <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;who will save, too, the life which has been lost for His sake; but, on the other hand, destroy that which for gain has been saved to His dishonour. With Him the faithful citizen is a soldier, just as the faithful soldier is a citizen.  A state of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> admits no plea of necessity; they are under no necessity to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whose one necessity is, that they do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For if one is pressed to the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and the sheer denial of Christ by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of torture or of punishment, yet discipline does not connive even at that necessity; because there is a higher necessity to dread denying and to undergo <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, than to escape from suffering, and to render the homage required. In fact, an excuse of this sort overturns the entire <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of our sacrament, removing even the obstacle to <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for it will be possible also to maintain that inclination is a necessity, as involving in it, forsooth, a sort of compulsion. I have, in fact, disposed of this very allegation of necessity with reference to the pleas by which crowns connected with official position are vindicated, in support of which it is in common use, since for this very reason offices must be either refused, that we may not fall into acts of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> endured that we may get quit of offices. Touching this primary aspect of the question, as to the unlawfulness even of a military life itself, I shall not add more, that the secondary question may be restored to its place. Indeed, if, putting my strength to the question, I banish from us the military life, I should now to no purpose issue a challenge on the matter of the military crown. Suppose, then, that the military service is lawful, as far as the plea for the crown is concerned. </p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>But I first say a word also about the crown itself. This laurel one is sacred to Apollo or Bacchus&mdash; to the former as the god of archery, to the latter as the god of triumphs. In like manner Claudius teaches; when he tells us that soldiers are wont too to be wreathed in myrtle. For the myrtle belongs to Venus, the mother of the &AElig;nead&aelig;, the mistress also of the god of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, who, through Ilia and the Romuli is Roman. But I do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Venus is Roman as well as Mars, because of the vexation the concubine gave her.  When military service again is crowned with olive, the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> has respect to Minerva, who is equally the goddess of arms&mdash; but got a crown of the tree referred to, because of the peace she made with Neptune. In these respects, the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> of the military garland will be everywhere defiled and all-defiling. And it is further defiled, I should think, also in the grounds of it. Lo the yearly public pronouncing of vows, what does that bear on its face to be? It takes place first in the part of the camp where the general's tent is, and then in the temples. In addition to the places, observe the words also: <q>We vow that you, O Jupiter, will then have an ox with gold-decorated horns.</q> What does the utterance mean? Without a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the denial (of Christ). Albeit the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> says nothing in these places with the mouth, he makes his response by having the crown on his head. The laurel is likewise commanded (to be used) at the distribution of the largess. So you see <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is not without its gain, selling, as it does, Christ for pieces of gold, as Judas did for pieces of silver. Will it be <q>You cannot serve God and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note030424"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;6:24</a></span> to devote your energies to <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>, and to depart from God? Will it be <q>Render unto C&aelig;sar the things which are C&aelig;sar's, and unto God the things which are God's,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030425"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;22:21</a></span> not only not to render the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but even to take the denarius from C&aelig;sar? Is the laurel of the triumph made of leaves, or of corpses? Is it adorned with ribbons, or with tombs? Is it bedewed with ointments, or with the tears of wives and mothers? It may be of some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> too;  for Christ is also among the barbarians.  Has not he who has carried (a crown for) this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> on his head, fought even against himself? Another son of service belongs to the royal guards. And indeed crowns are called (Castrenses), as belonging to the camp; <em>Munific&aelig;</em> likewise, from the C&aelig;sarean functions they perform. But even then you are still the soldier and the servant of another; and if of two masters, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and C&aelig;sar: but assuredly then not of C&aelig;sar, when you owe yourself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as having higher claims, I should think, even in matters in which both have an interest.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>For state reasons, the various orders of the citizens also are crowned with laurel crowns; but the magistrates besides with golden ones, as at Athens, and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Even to those are preferred the Etruscan. This appellation is given to the crowns which, distinguished by their gems and oak leaves of gold, they put on, with mantles having an embroidery of palm branches, to conduct the chariots containing the images of the gods to the circus. There are also provincial crowns of gold, needing now the larger heads of images instead of those of men. But your orders, and your magistracies, and your very place of meeting, the church, are Christ's. You belong to Him, for you have been enrolled in the books of life. <span class="stiki" id="note030428"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse3">Philippians&nbsp;4:3</a></span> There the blood of the Lord serves for your purple robe, and your broad stripe is His own cross; there the axe is already laid to the trunk of the tree; <span class="stiki" id="note030429"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;3:10</a></span> there is the branch out of the root of Jesse. <span class="stiki" id="note030430"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;11:1</a></span> Never mind the state horses with their crown. Your Lord, when, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, He would enter Jerusalem in triumph, had not even an ass of His own. These (put their trust) in chariots, and these in horses; but we will seek our help in the name of the Lord our God.  From so much as a dwelling in that <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> of John's Revelation  we are called away; much more then from its pomp. The rabble, too, are crowned, at one time because of some great rejoicing for the success of the emperors; at another, on account of some custom belonging to municipal festivals. For luxury strives to make her own every occasion of public <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>. But as for you, you are a foreigner in this world, a citizen of Jerusalem, the city above. Our citizenship, the apostle says, is in heaven. <span class="stiki" id="note030433"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse20">Philippians&nbsp;3:20</a></span> You have your own registers, your own calendar; you have nothing to do with the joys of the world; nay, you are called to the very opposite, for <q>the world shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, but you shall mourn.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030434"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse20">John&nbsp;16:20</a></span> And I think the Lord affirms, that those who mourn are <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, not those who are crowned. Marriage, too, decks the bridegroom with its crown; and therefore we will not have <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> brides, lest they seduce us even to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> with which among them marriage is initiated. You have the law from the patriarchs indeed; you have the apostle enjoining people to marry in the Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note030435"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse39">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:39</a></span> You have a crowning also on the making of a freeman; but <em>you</em> have been already ransomed by Christ, and that at a great price. How shall the world manumit the servant of another? Though it seems to be liberty, yet it will come to be found bondage. In the world everything is nominal, and nothing real. For even then, as ransomed by Christ, you were under no bondage to man; and now, though man has given you liberty, you are the servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. If you think freedom of the world to be real, so that you even seal it with a crown, you have returned to the slavery of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, imagining it to be freedom; you have lost the freedom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, fancying it is slavery. Will there be any dispute as to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of crown-wearing, which contests in the games in their turn supply, and which, both as sacred to the gods and in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the dead, their own reason at once condemns? It only remains, that the Olympian Jupiter, and the Nemean Hercules, and the wretched little Archemorus, and the hapless Antinous, should be crowned in a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, that he himself may become a spectacle disgusting to behold. We have recounted, as I think, all the various causes of the wearing of the crown, and there is not one which has any place with us: all are foreign to us, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a>, unlawful, having been abjured already once for all in the solemn declaration of the sacrament. For they were of the pomp of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, offices of the world,  honours, festivals, popularity huntings, false vows, exhibitions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> servility, empty praises, base glories, and in them all <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, even in respect of the origin of the crowns alone, with which they are all wreathed. Claudius will tell us in his preface, indeed, that in the poems of Homer the heaven also is crowned with constellations, and that no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> for man; therefore man himself, too, should be crowned by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the world crowns brothels, and baths, and bakehouses, and prisons, and schools, and the very amphitheatres, and the chambers where the clothes are stripped from dead gladiators, and the very biers of the dead. How sacred and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, how venerable and pure is this article of dress, determine not from the heaven of poetry alone, but from the traffickings of the whole world. But indeed a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> will not even dishonour his own gate with laurel crowns, if so be he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how many gods the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has attached to doors; Janus so-called from gate, Limentinus from threshold, Forcus and Carna from leaves and hinges; among the Greeks, too, the Thyr&aelig;an Apollo, and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, the Antelii.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>Much less may the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> put the service of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> on his own head&mdash; nay, I might have said, upon Christ, since Christ is the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man&mdash; (for his head) is as free as even Christ is, under no obligation to wear a covering, not to say a band. But even the head which is bound to have the veil, I mean <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a>, as already taken possession of by this very thing, is not open also to a band. She has the burden of her own humility to bear. If she ought not to appear with her head uncovered on account of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,  much more with a crown on it will she offend those (elders) who perhaps are then wearing crowns above. <span class="stiki" id="note030438"><a href="../bible/rev004.htm#verse4">Revelation&nbsp;4:4</a></span> For what is a crown on the head of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but beauty made seductive, but mark of utter wantonness&mdash;a notable casting away of modesty, a setting <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> on fire? Therefore a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, taking counsel from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> foresight,  will not too elaborately adorn herself, that she may not either be crowned with any exquisite arrangement of her hair. What sort of garland, however, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, did He who is the Head of the man and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, Christ Jesus, the Husband of the church, submit to in behalf of both sexes? Of thorns, I think, and thistles&mdash;a figure of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which the soil of the flesh brought forth for us, but which the power of the cross removed, blunting, in its endurance by the head of our Lord, death's every sting. Yes, and besides the figure, there is contumely with ready lip, and dishonour, and <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>, and the ferocity involved in the cruel things which then disfigured and lacerated the temples of the Lord, that you may now be crowned with laurel, and myrtle, and olive, and any famous branch, and which is of more use, with hundred-leaved roses too, culled from the garden of Midas, and with both kinds of lily, and with violets of all sorts, perhaps also with gems and gold, so as even to rival that crown of Christ which He afterwards obtained. For it was after the gall He tasted the honeycomb  and He was not greeted as King of Glory in heavenly places till He had been condemned to the cross as King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, having first been made by the Father for a time a little less than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and so crowned with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. If for these things, you owe your own head to Him, repay it if you can, such as He presented His for yours; or be not crowned with flowers at all, if you cannot be with thorns, because you may not be with flowers.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p>Keep for God His own property untainted; He will crown it if He choose. Nay, then, He does even choose. He calls us to it. To him who conquers He says, <q>I will give a crown of life.</q>  Be <em>you</em>, too, faithful unto death, and fight <em>you</em>, too, the good fight, whose crown the apostle <span class="stiki" id="note030442"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:8</a></span> feels so <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> confident has been laid up for him. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> <span class="stiki" id="note030443"><a href="../bible/rev006.htm#verse2">Revelation&nbsp;6:2</a></span> also, as he goes forth on a white horse, conquering and to conquer, receives a crown of victory; and another <span class="stiki" id="note030444"><a href="../bible/rev010.htm#verse1">Revelation&nbsp;10:1</a></span> is adorned with an encircling rainbow (as it were in its fair colours)&mdash; a celestial meadow. In like manner, the elders sit crowned around, crowned too with a crown of gold, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> Himself flashes out above the clouds. If such are the appearances in the vision of the seer, of what sort will be the realities in the actual manifestation? Look at those crowns. Inhale those odours. Why condemn you to a little chaplet, or a twisted headband, the brow which has been destined for a diadem? For Christ Jesus has made us even kings to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His Father. What have you in common with the flower which is to die? You have a flower in the Branch of Jesse, upon which the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Divine Spirit in all its fullness rested&mdash; a flower undefiled, unfading, everlasting, by choosing which the good soldier, too, has got promotion in the heavenly ranks. Blush, you fellow-soldiers of his, henceforth not to be condemned even by him, but by some soldier of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a>, who, at his initiation in the gloomy cavern, in the camp, it may well be said, of darkness, when at the sword's point a crown is presented to him, as though in mimicry of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and thereupon put upon his head, is admonished to resist and cast it off, and, if you like, transfer it to his shoulder, saying that <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a> is his crown. And thenceforth he is never crowned; and he has that for a mark to show who he is, if anywhere he be subjected to trial in respect of his religion; and he is at once <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be a soldier of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a> if he throws the crown away&mdash; if he say that in his god he has his crown. Let us take note of the devices of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who is wont to ape some of God's things with no other design than, by the faithfulness of his servants, to put us to shame, and to condemn us.</p>
