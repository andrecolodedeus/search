<h1>The City of God (Book I)</h1>

<p class="h1a">Augustine censures the pagans, who attributed the calamities of the world, and especially the recent sack of Rome by the Goths, to the Christian religion, and its prohibition of the worship of the gods. He speaks of the blessings and ills of life, which then, as always, happened to good and bad men alike. Finally, he rebukes the shamelessness of those who cast up to the Christians that their women had been violated by the soldiers.</p>

<h2>Preface, Explaining His Design in Undertaking This Work.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> city of God  is my theme in this work, which you, my dearest son Marcellinus,  suggested, and which is due to you by my promise. I have undertaken its defence against those who prefer their own gods to the Founder of this city&mdash;a city surpassingly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, whether we view it as it still lives by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in this fleeting course of time, and sojourns as a stranger in the midst of the ungodly, or as it shall dwell in the fixed stability of its <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> seat, which it now with patience waits for, expecting until <q>righteousness shall return unto judgment,</q>  and it obtain, by virtue of its excellence, final victory and perfect peace. A great work this, and an arduous; but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is my helper. For I am aware what ability is requisite to persuade the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> how great is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of humility, which raises us, not by a quite <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> arrogance, but by a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, above all earthly dignities that totter on this shifting scene. For the King and Founder of this city of which we speak, has in Scripture uttered to His people a dictum of the divine law in these words: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> resists the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, but gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unto the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>.</q>  But this, which is God's prerogative, the inflated ambition of a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> spirit also affects, and dearly loves that this be numbered among its attributes, to</p>

<blockquote><p>Show pity to the humbled <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,
<br>And crush the sons of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>And therefore, as the plan of this work we have undertaken requires, and as occasion offers, we must speak also of the earthly city, which, though it be mistress of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, is itself ruled by its <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of rule.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; Of the Adversaries of the Name of Christ, Whom the Barbarians for Christ's Sake Spared When They Stormed the City.</h2>

<p>For to this earthly city belong the enemies against whom I have to defend the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Many of them, indeed, being reclaimed from their ungodly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, have become sufficiently creditable citizens of this city; but  many are so inflamed with <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against it, and are so ungrateful to its Redeemer for His signal benefits, as to forget that they would now be unable to utter a single word to its prejudice, had they not found in its sacred places, as they fled from the enemy's steel, that life in which they now boast themselves.  Are not those very Romans, who were spared by the barbarians through their respect for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, become enemies to the name of Christ? The reliquaries of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and the churches of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to this; for in the sack of the city they were open sanctuary for all who fled to them, whether <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> or Pagan. To their very threshold the blood-thirsty enemy raged; there his murderous fury owned a limit. Thither did such of the enemy as had any pity convey those to whom they had given quarter, lest any less mercifully disposed might fall upon them. And, indeed, when even those murderers who everywhere else showed themselves pitiless came to those spots where that was forbidden which the license of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> permitted in every other place, their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> rage for slaughter was bridled, and their eagerness to take prisoners was quenched. Thus escaped multitudes who now reproach the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, and impute to Christ the ills that have befallen their city; but the preservation of their own life&mdash; a boon which they owe to the respect entertained for Christ by the barbarians&mdash; they attribute not to our Christ, but to their own good luck. They ought rather, had they any right perceptions, to attribute the severities and hardships inflicted by their enemies, to that <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> which is wont to reform the depraved manners of men by chastisement, and which exercises with similar afflictions the righteous and praiseworthy&mdash;either translating them, when they have passed through the trial, to a better world, or detaining them still on earth for ulterior purposes. And they ought to attribute it to the spirit of these <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> times, that, contrary to the custom of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, these bloodthirsty barbarians spared them, and spared them for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, whether this mercy was actually shown in promiscuous places, or in those places specially dedicated to Christ's name, and of which the very largest were selected as sanctuaries, that full scope might thus be given to the expansive compassion which desired that a large multitude might find shelter there. Therefore ought they to give God thanks, and with sincere confession flee for refuge to His name, that so they may escape the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>&mdash; they who with lying lips took upon them this name, that they might escape the punishment of present destruction. For of those whom you see insolently and shamelessly insulting the servants of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, there are numbers who would not have escaped that destruction and slaughter had they not pretended that they themselves were Christ's servants. Yet now, in ungrateful <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and most impious <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, and at the risk of being punished in everlasting darkness, they perversely oppose that name under which they fraudulently protected themselves for the sake of enjoying the light of this brief life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; That It is Quite Contrary to the Usage of War, that the Victors Should Spare the Vanquished for the Sake of Their Gods.</h2>

<p>There are histories of numberless <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, both before the building of Rome and since its rise and the extension of its dominion; let these be read, and let one instance be cited in which, when a city had been taken by foreigners, the victors spared those who were found to have fled for sanctuary to the temples of their gods;  or one instance in which a barbarian general gave orders that none should be put to the sword who had been found in this or that temple. Did not &AElig;neas see</p>

<blockquote><p>Dying Priam at the shrine,
<br>Staining the hearth he made divine? 
<p>Did not Diomede and Ulysses
<br>Drag with red hands, the sentry slain,
<br>Her fateful image from your fane,
<br>Her chaste locks touch, and stain with gore
<br>The virgin coronal she wore? 
<p>Neither is that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which follows, that
<br>Thenceforth the tide of fortune changed,
<br>And Greece grew weak. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>For after this they conquered and destroyed Troy with fire and sword; after this they beheaded Priam as he fled to the altars. Neither did Troy perish because it lost Minerva. For what had Minerva herself first lost, that she should perish? Her guards perhaps? No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>; just her guards. For as soon as they were slain, she could be stolen. It was not, in fact, the men who were preserved by the image, but the image by the men. How,  then, was she invoked to defend the city and the citizens, she who could not defend her own defenders?</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; That the Romans Did Not Show Their Usual Sagacity When They Trusted that They Would Be Benefited by the Gods Who Had Been Unable to Defend Troy.</h2>

<p>And these be the gods to whose protecting care the Romans were delighted to entrust their city! O too, too piteous mistake! And they are enraged at us when we speak thus about their gods, though, so far from being enraged at their own writers, they part with money to learn what they say; and, indeed, the very teachers of these authors are reckoned worthy of a salary from the public purse, and of other <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>. There is Virgil, who is read by boys, in order that this great poet, this most famous and approved of all poets, may impregnate their virgin minds, and may not readily be forgotten by them, according to that saying of Horace,</p>

<blockquote><p><q>The fresh cask long keeps its first tang.</q> 

<br>Well, in this Virgil, I say, Juno is introduced as hostile to the Trojans, and stirring up &AElig;olus, the king of the winds, against them in the words,

<br>A race I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> now ploughs the sea,

<br>Transporting Troy to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>,

<br>And home-gods conquered. ..
</p></blockquote>

<p>And ought <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> men to have entrusted the defence of Rome to these conquered gods? But it will be said, this was only the saying of Juno, who, like an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what she was saying. What, then, says &AElig;neas himself&mdash;&AElig;neas who is so often designated <q><a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>?</q> Does he not say,</p>

<blockquote><p>Lo! Panthus, 'scaped from death by flight,

<br>Priest of Apollo on the height,

<br>His conquered gods with trembling hands

<br>He bears, and shelter swift demands? 

<br>Is it not clear that the gods (whom he does not scruple to call <q>conquered</q>) were rather entrusted to &AElig;neas than he to them, when it is said to him,

<br>The gods of her domestic shrines

<br>Your country to your care consigns? 
</p></blockquote>

<p>If, then, Virgil says that the gods were such as these, and were conquered, and that when conquered they could not escape except under the protection of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, what a <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> is it to suppose that Rome had been wisely entrusted to these guardians, and could not have been taken unless it had lost them! Indeed, to worship conquered gods as protectors and champions, what is this but to worship, not good divinities, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> omens?  Would it not be wiser to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, not that Rome would never have fallen into so great a calamity had not they first perished, but rather that they would have perished long since had not Rome preserved them as long as she could? For who does not see, when he thinks of it, what a foolish assumption it is that they could not be vanquished under vanquished defenders, and that they only perished because they had lost their guardian gods, when, indeed, the only <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their perishing was that they chose for their protectors gods condemned to perish? &nbsp;The poets, therefore, when they composed and sang these things about the conquered gods, had no intention to invent falsehoods, but uttered, as honest men, what the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> extorted from them. This, however, will be carefully and copiously discussed in another and more fitting place. Meanwhile I will briefly, and to the best of my ability, explain what I meant to say about these ungrateful men who blasphemously impute to Christ the calamities which they deservedly suffer in consequence of their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> ways, while that which is for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake spared them in spite of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> they do not even take the trouble to notice; and in their mad and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> insolence, they use against His name those very lips wherewith they <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> claimed that same name that their lives might be spared. In the places <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, where for His sake no enemy would injure them, they restrained their tongues that they might be safe and protected; but no sooner do they emerge from these sanctuaries, than they unbridle these tongues to hurl against Him curses full of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; Of the Asylum of Juno in Troy, Which Saved No One from the Greeks; And of the Churches of the Apostles, Which Protected from the Barbarians All Who Fled to Them.</h2>

<p>Troy itself, the mother of the Roman people, was not able, as I have said, to protect its own citizens in the sacred places of their gods from the fire and sword of the Greeks, though the Greeks worshipped the same gods. Not only so, but</p>

<blockquote><p>Phoenix and Ulysses fell

<br>In the void courts by Juno's cell

<br>Were set the spoils to keep;

<br>Snatched from the burning shrines away,

<br>There Ilium's mighty treasure lay,  

<br>Rich altars, bowls of massy gold,

<br>And captive raiment, rudely rolled

<br>In one promiscuous heap;

<br>While boys and matrons, wild with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>,

<br>In long array were standing near. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;In other words, the place <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to so great a goddess was chosen, not that from it none might be led out a captive, but that in it all the captives might be immured. Compare now this <q>asylum</q>&mdash; the asylum not of an ordinary god, not of one of the rank and file of gods, but of Jove's own sister and wife, the queen of all the gods&mdash; with the churches built in memory of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Into it were collected the spoils rescued from the blazing temples and snatched from the gods, not that they might be restored to the vanquished, but divided among the victors; while into these was carried back, with the most religious observance and respect, everything which belonged to them, even though found elsewhere. There liberty was lost; here preserved. There bondage was strict; here strictly excluded. Into that temple men were driven to become the chattels of their enemies, now lording it over them; into these churches men were led by their relenting foes, that they might be at liberty. In fine, the gentle  Greeks appropriated that temple of Juno to the purposes of their own <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; while these churches of Christ were chosen even by the savage barbarians as the fit scenes for humility and mercy. But perhaps, after all, the Greeks did in that victory of theirs spare the temples of those gods whom they worshipped in common with the Trojans, and did not dare to put to the sword or make captive the wretched and vanquished Trojans who fled there; and perhaps Virgil, in the manner of poets, has depicted what never really happened? But there is no question that he depicted the usual custom of an enemy when sacking a city.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; C&aelig;sar's Statement Regarding the Universal Custom of an Enemy When Sacking a City.</h2>

<p>Even C&aelig;sar himself gives us positive testimony regarding this custom; for, in his deliverance in the senate about the conspirators, he says (as Sallust, a historian of distinguished veracity, writes ) <q>that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and boys are violated, children torn from the embrace of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, matrons subjected to whatever should be the pleasure of the conquerors, temples and houses plundered, slaughter and burning rife; in fine, all things filled with arms, corpses, blood, and wailing.</q> If he had not mentioned temples here, we might suppose that enemies were in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of sparing the dwellings of the gods. And the Roman temples were in danger of these disasters, not from foreign foes, but from Catiline and his associates, the most noble senators and citizens of Rome. But these, it may be said, were abandoned men, and the parricides of their fatherland.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; That Not Even the Romans, When They Took Cities, Spared the Conquered in Their Temples.</h2>

<p>Why, then, need our argument take note of the many nations who have waged <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with one another, and have nowhere spared the conquered in the temples of their gods? Let us look at the practice of the Romans themselves; let us, I say, recall and review the Romans, whose chief praise it has been <q>to spare the vanquished and subdue the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>,</q> and that they preferred <q>rather to forgive than to revenge an injury;</q>  and among so many and great cities which they have stormed, taken, and overthrown for the extension of their dominion, let us be told what temples they were accustomed to exempt, so that whoever took refuge in them was free. Or have they really done this, and has the fact been suppressed by the historians of these events? Is it to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, that men who sought out with the greatest eagerness points they could praise, would omit those which, in their own estimation, are the most signal <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>? Marcus Marcellus, a distinguished Roman, who took Syracuse, a most splendidly adorned city, is reported to have bewailed its coming ruin, and to have shed his own tears over it before he spilt its blood. He took steps also to preserve the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> even of his enemy. For before he gave orders for the storming of the city, he issued an edict forbidding the violation of any free person. Yet the city was sacked according to the custom of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; nor do we anywhere read, that even by so chaste and gentle a commander orders were given that no one should be injured who had fled to this or that temple. And this certainly would by no means have been omitted, when neither his weeping nor his edict preservative of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> could be passed in silence. Fabius, the conqueror of the city of Tarentum, is praised for abstaining from making booty of the images. For when his secretary proposed the question to him, what he wished done with  the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of the gods, which had been taken in large numbers, he veiled his moderation under a joke. For he asked of what sort they were; and when they reported to him that there were not only many large images, but some of them armed, <q>Oh,</q> says he, <q>let us leave with the Tarentines their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> gods.</q> Seeing, then, that the writers of Roman history could not pass in silence, neither the weeping of the one general nor the laughing of the other, neither the chaste pity of the one nor the facetious moderation of the other, on what occasion would it be omitted, if, for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of any of their enemy's gods, they had shown this particular form of leniency, that in any temple slaughter or captivity was prohibited?</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; That the Cruelties Which Occurred in the Sack of Rome Were in Accordance with the Custom of War, Whereas the Acts of Clemency Resulted from the Influence of Christ's Name.</h2>

<p>All the spoiling, then, which Rome was exposed to in the recent calamity&mdash; all the slaughter, plundering, burning, and misery&mdash; was the result of the custom of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. But what was novel, was that savage barbarians showed themselves in so gentle a guise, that the largest churches were chosen and set apart for the purpose of being filled with the people to whom quarter was given, and that in them none were slain, from them none forcibly dragged; that into them many were led by their relenting enemies to be set at liberty, and that from them none were led into slavery by merciless foes. Whoever does not see that this is to be attributed to the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> temper, is blind; whoever sees this, and gives no praise, is ungrateful; whoever hinders any one from praising it, is mad. Far be it from any <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> man to impute this clemency to the barbarians. Their fierce and bloody minds were awed, and bridled, and marvellously tempered by Him who so long before said by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>I will visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquities with stripes; nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from them.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; Of the Advantages and Disadvantages Which Often Indiscriminately Accrue to Good and Wicked Men.</h2>

<p>Will some one say, Why, then, was this divine compassion extended even to the ungodly and ungrateful? Why, but because it was the mercy of Him who daily <q>makes His sun to rise on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120048"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> For though some of these men, taking thought of this, repent of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and reform, some, as the apostle says, <q>despising the riches of His goodness and long-suffering, after their hardness and impenitent heart, treasure up unto themselves <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> against the day of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and revelation of the righteous judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who will render to every man according to his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120049"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;2:4</a></span> nevertheless does the patience of God still invite the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to repentance, even as the scourge of God educates the good to patience. And so, too, does the mercy of God embrace the good that it may cherish them, as the severity of God arrests the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to punish them. To the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> it has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to prepare in the world to come for the righteous <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, which the unrighteous shall not enjoy; and for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, by which the good shall not be tormented. But as for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of this life, and its ills, God has willed that these should be common to both; that we might not too eagerly <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> the things which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men are seen equally to enjoy, nor shrink with an unseemly <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> from the ills which even good men often suffer.</p>

<p>There is, too, a very great difference in the purpose served both by those events which we call adverse and those called prosperous. For the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man is neither uplifted with the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of time, nor broken by its ills; but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man, because he is corrupted by this world's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, feels himself punished by its unhappiness.  Yet often, even in the present distribution of temporal things, does God plainly evince His own interference. For if every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> were now visited with manifest punishment, nothing would seem to be reserved for the final judgment; on the other hand, if no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> received now a plainly divine punishment, it would be concluded that there is no <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> at all. And so of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of this life: if God did not by a very visible liberality confer these on some of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who ask for them, we should say that these <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things were not at His disposal; and if He gave them to all who sought them, we should suppose that such were the only rewards of His service; and such a service would make us not godly, but greedy rather, and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>. Wherefore, though good and bad men suffer alike, we must not suppose that there is no difference between the men themselves, because there is no  difference in what they both suffer. For even in the likeness of the sufferings, there remains an unlikeness in the sufferers; and though exposed to the same anguish, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> are not the same thing. For as the same fire causes gold to glow brightly, and chaff to smoke; and under the same flail the straw is beaten small, while the grain is cleansed; and as the lees are not mixed with the oil, though squeezed out of the vat by the same pressure, so the same <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of affliction proves, purges, clarifies the good, but damns, ruins, exterminates the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. And thus it is that in the same affliction the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> detest God and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>, while the good <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and praise. So material a difference does it make, not what ills are suffered, but what kind of man suffers them. For, stirred up with the same movement, mud exhales a horrible stench, and ointment emits a fragrant odor.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; Of the Reasons for Administering Correction to Bad and Good Together.</h2>

<p>What, then, have the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> suffered in that calamitous period, which would not profit every one who duly and faithfully considered the following circumstances? First of all, they must humbly consider those very <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which have provoked God to fill the world with such terrible disasters; for although they be far from the excesses of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, immoral, and ungodly men, yet they do not judge themselves so clean removed from all faults as to be too good to suffer for these even temporal ills. For every man, however laudably he lives, yet yields in some points to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh. Though he do not fall into gross enormity of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and abandoned viciousness, and abominable profanity, yet he slips into some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, either rarely or so much the more frequently as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> seem of less account. But not to mention this, where can we readily find a man who holds in fit and just estimation those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> on account of whose revolting <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, luxury, and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, and cursed iniquities and impiety, God now smites the earth as His predictions threatened? Where is the man who lives with them in the style in which it becomes us to live with them? For often we wickedly blind ourselves to the occasions of teaching and admonishing them, sometimes even of reprimanding and chiding them, either because we shrink from the labor or are ashamed to offend them, or because we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to lose good friendships, lest this should stand in the way of our advancement, or injure us in some worldly matter, which either our <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> disposition desires to obtain, or our weakness shrinks from losing. So that, although the conduct of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men is distasteful to the good, and therefore they do not fall with them into that damnation which in the next life awaits such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, yet, because they spare their damnable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, therefore, even though their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be slight and venial, they are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> scourged with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in this world, though in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> they quite escape punishment. Justly, when God afflicts them in common with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, do they find this life bitter, through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of whose sweetness they declined to be bitter to these sinners.</p>

<p>If any one forbears to reprove and find fault with those who are doing wrong, because he seeks a more seasonable opportunity, or because he fears they may be made worse by his rebuke, or that other weak <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> may be disheartened from endeavoring to lead a good and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> life, and may be driven from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; this man's omission seems to be occasioned not by <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, but by a charitable consideration. But what is blame-worthy is, that they who themselves revolt from the conduct of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and live in quite another fashion, yet spare those faults in other men which they ought to reprehend and wean them from; and spare them because they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to give offense, lest they should injure their interests in those things which good men may innocently and legitimately use&mdash;though they use them more greedily than becomes <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are strangers in this world, and profess the hope of a heavenly country. For not only the weaker brethren who enjoy married life, and have children (or desire to have them), and own houses and establishments, whom the apostle addresses in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, warning and instructing them how they should live, both the wives with their husbands, and the husbands with their wives, the children with their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> with their children, and servants with their masters, and masters with their servants&mdash;not only do these weaker brethren gladly obtain and grudgingly lose many earthly and temporal things on account of which they dare not offend men whose polluted and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> life greatly displeases them; but those also who live at a higher level, who are not entangled in the meshes of married life, but use meagre food and raiment, do often take thought of their own safety and good name, and abstain from finding fault with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, because they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> their wiles and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. And although they do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> them to such an extent as to be drawn to the commission of like iniquities, nay, not by any threats or <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> soever; yet those very <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which  they refuse to share in the commission of they often decline to find fault with, when possibly they might by finding fault prevent their commission. They abstain from interference, because they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that, if it fail of good effect, their own safety or <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> may be damaged or destroyed; not because they see that their preservation and good name are needful, that they may be able to influence those who need their instruction, but rather because they weakly relish the flattery and respect of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the judgments of the people, and the pain or death of the body; that is to say, their non-intervention is the result of selfishness, and not of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p>Accordingly this seems to me to be one principal reason why the good are chastised along with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, when God is pleased to visit with temporal punishments the profligate manners of a community. They are punished together, not because they have spent an equally corrupt life, but because the good as well as the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, though not equally with them, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> this present life; while they ought to hold it cheap, that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, being admonished and reformed by their example, might lay hold of life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. And if they will not be the companions of the good in seeking life everlasting, they should be loved as enemies, and be dealt with patiently. For so long as they live, it remains uncertain whether they may not come to a better mind. These selfish <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have more <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> than those to whom it was said through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>He is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120051"><a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse6">Ezekiel&nbsp;33:6</a></span> For watchmen or overseers of the people are appointed in churches, that they may unsparingly rebuke <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nor is that man guiltless of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> we speak of, who, though he be not a watchman, yet sees in the conduct of those with whom the relationships of this life bring him into contact, many things that should be blamed, and yet overlooks them, fearing to give offense, and lose such worldly blessings as may legitimately be desired, but which he too eagerly grasps. Then, lastly, there is another reason why the good are afflicted with temporal calamities&mdash; the reason which Job's case exemplifies: that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> spirit may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, and that it may be manifested with what <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> trust, and with how unmercenary a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, it cleaves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; That the Saints Lose Nothing in Losing Temporal Goods.</h2>

<p>These are the considerations which one must keep in view, that he may answer the question whether any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> happens to the faithful and godly which cannot be turned to profit. Or shall we say that the question is needless, and that the apostle is vaporing when he says, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all things work together for good to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120053"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;8:28</a></span> </p>

<p>They lost all they had. Their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Their godliness? The possessions of the hidden man of the heart, which in the sight of God are of great price? <span class="stiki" id="note120054"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:4</a></span> Did they lose these? For these are the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, to whom the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> apostle said, <q>Godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and raiment, let us be therewith content. But they that will be rich fall into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; which, while some <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> after, they have erred from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</q> </p>

<p>They, then, who lost their worldly all in the sack of Rome, if they owned their possessions as they had been taught by the apostle, who himself was poor without, but rich within&mdash;that is to say, if they used the world as not using it&mdash;could say in the words of Job, heavily tried, but not overcome: <q>Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there: the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; as it pleased the Lord, so has it come to pass: blessed be the name of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120056"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse21">Job&nbsp;1:21</a></span> Like a good servant, Job counted the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his Lord his great possession, by <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to which his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was enriched; nor did it grieve him to lose, while yet living, those goods which he must shortly leave at his death. But as to those feebler spirits who, though they cannot be said to prefer earthly possessions to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, do yet cleave to them with a somewhat immoderate attachment, they have discovered by the pain of losing these things how much they were sinning in loving them. For their grief is of their own making; in the words of the apostle quoted above, <q>they have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</q> For it was well that they who had so long despised these verbal admonitions should receive the teaching of experience. For when the apostle says, <q>They that will be rich fall into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>,</q> and so on, what he blames in riches is not the possession of them, but the desire of them. For elsewhere he says, <q>Charge them that  are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gives us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120057"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:17-19</a></span> They who were making such a use of their property have been consoled for light losses by great gains, and have had more pleasure in those possessions which they have securely laid past, by freely giving them away, than grief in those which they entirely lost by an anxious and selfish hoarding of them. For nothing could perish on earth save what they would be ashamed to carry away from earth. Our Lord's injunction runs, <q>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust does corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust does corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120058"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;6:19-21</a></span> And they who have listened to this injunction have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the time of tribulation how well they were advised in not despising this most trustworthy teacher, and most faithful and mighty guardian of their treasure. For if many were glad that their treasure was stored in places which the enemy chanced not to light upon, how much better founded was the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of those who, by the counsel of their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, had fled with their treasure to a citadel which no enemy can possibly reach! Thus our <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">Paulinus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Nola,  who voluntarily abandoned vast <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and became quite poor, though abundantly rich in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, when the barbarians sacked Nola, and took him prisoner, used silently to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, as he afterwards told me, <q>O Lord, let me not be troubled for gold and silver, for where all my treasure is You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q> For all his treasure was where he had been taught to hide and store it by Him who had also foretold that these calamities would happen in the world. Consequently those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> their Lord when He warned them where and how to lay up treasure, did not lose even their earthly possessions in the invasion of the barbarians; while those who are now repenting that they did not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him have learned the right use of earthly goods, if not by the wisdom which would have prevented their loss, at least by the experience which follows it.</p>

<p>But some good and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> men have been put to the torture, that they might be forced to deliver up their goods to the enemy. They could indeed neither deliver nor lose that good which made themselves good. If, however, they preferred torture to the surrender of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of iniquity, then I say they were not good men. Rather they should have been reminded that, if they suffered so severely for the sake of money, they should endure all torment, if need be, for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake; that they might be taught to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him rather who enriches with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> felicity all who suffer for Him, and not silver and gold, for which it was pitiable to suffer, whether they preserved it by telling a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> or lost it by telling the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For under these tortures no one lost Christ by confessing Him, no one preserved <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> save by denying its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. So that possibly the torture which taught them that they should set their affections on a possession they could not lose, was more useful than those possessions which, without any useful fruit at all, disquieted and tormented their anxious owners. But then we are reminded that some were tortured who had no <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> to surrender, but who were not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> when they said so. These too, however, had perhaps some craving for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and were not willingly poor with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> resignation; and to such it had to be made plain, that not the actual possession alone, but also the desire of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, deserved such excruciating pains. And even if they were destitute of any hidden stores of gold and silver, because they were living in hopes of a better life&mdash;I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not indeed if any such person was tortured on the supposition that he had <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>; but if so, then certainly in confessing, when put to the question, a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> poverty, he confessed Christ. And though it was scarcely to be expected that the barbarians should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him, yet no confessor of a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> poverty could be tortured without receiving a heavenly reward.</p>

<p>Again, they say that the long famine laid many a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> low. But this, too, the faithful turned to good uses by a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> endurance of it. For those whom famine killed outright it rescued from the ills of this life, as a kindly disease would have done; and those who were only hunger-bitten were taught to live more sparingly, and inured to longer <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; Of the End of This Life, Whether It is Material that It Be Long Delayed.</h2>

<p>But, it is added, many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were slaughtered, and were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in a hideous  variety of cruel ways. Well, if this be hard to bear, it is assuredly the common lot of all who are born into this life. Of this at least I am certain, that no one has ever died who was not destined to die some time. Now the end of life puts the longest life on a par with the shortest. For of two things which have alike ceased to be, the one is not better, the other worse&mdash; the one greater, the other less.  And of what consequence is it what kind of death puts an end to life, since he who has died once is not forced to go through the same ordeal a second time? And as in the daily casualties of life every man is, as it were, threatened with numberless deaths, so long as it remains uncertain which of them is his <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, I would ask whether it is not better to suffer one and die, than to live in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of all? I am not unaware of the poor-spirited <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> which prompts us to choose rather to live long in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of so many deaths, than to die once and so escape them all; but the weak and cowardly shrinking of the flesh is one thing, and the well-considered and reasonable persuasion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> quite another. That death is not to be judged an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is the end of a good life; for death becomes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> only by the retribution which follows it. They, then, who are destined to die, need not be careful to inquire what death they are to die, but into what place death will usher them. And since <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are well aware that the death of the godly pauper whose sores the dogs licked was far better than of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> rich man who lay in purple and fine linen, what harm could these terrific deaths do to the dead who had lived well?</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; Of the Burial of the Dead: that the Denial of It to Christians Does Them No Injury.</h2> 

<p>Further still, we are reminded that in such a carnage as then occurred, the bodies could not even be buried. But godly confidence is not appalled by so ill-omened a circumstance; for the faithful bear in mind that assurance has been given that not a hair of their head shall perish, and that, therefore, though they even be devoured by beasts, their blessed resurrection will not hereby be hindered. The Truth would nowise have said, <q>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120062"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;10:28</a></span> if anything whatever that an enemy could do to the body of the slain could be detrimental to the future life. Or will some one perhaps take so absurd a position as to contend that those who kill the body are not to be feared before death, and lest they kill the body, but after death, lest they deprive it of burial? If this be so, then that is false which Christ says, <q>Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120063"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse4">Luke&nbsp;12:4</a></span> for it seems they can do great injury to the dead body. Far be it from us to suppose that the Truth can be thus false. They who kill the body are said <q>to do something,</q> because the deathblow is felt, the body still having sensation; but after that, they have no more that they can do, for in the slain body there is no sensation. And so there are indeed many bodies of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> lying unburied; but no one has separated them from heaven, nor from that earth which is all filled with the presence of Him who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> whence He will raise again what He created. &nbsp;It is said, indeed, in the Psalm: <q>The dead bodies of Your servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of Your <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> unto the beasts of the earth. Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.</q>  But this was said rather to exhibit the cruelty of those who did these things, than the misery of those who suffered them. To the eyes of men this appears a harsh and doleful lot, yet <q>precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</q>  Wherefore all these last offices and ceremonies that concern the dead, the careful funeral arrangements, and the equipment of the tomb, and the pomp of obsequies, are rather the solace of the living than the comfort of the dead. If a costly burial does any good to a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man, a squalid burial, or none at all, may harm the godly. His crowd of domestics furnished the purple-clad Dives with a funeral gorgeous in the eye of man; but in the sight of God that was a more sumptuous funeral which the ulcerous pauper received at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who did not carry him out to a marble tomb, but bore him aloft to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom.</p>

<p>The men against whom I have undertaken to defend the city of God laugh at all this. But even their own <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>  have despised a careful burial; and often whole armies have fought and fallen for their earthly country without caring to inquire whether they  would be left exposed on the field of battle, or become the food of wild beasts. Of this noble disregard of sepulture poetry has well said: <q>He who has no tomb has the sky for his vault.</q>  How much less ought they to insult over the unburied bodies of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, to whom it has been promised that the flesh itself shall be restored, and the body formed anew, all the members of it being gathered not only from the earth, but from the most secret recesses of any other of the elements in which the dead bodies of men have lain hid!</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; Reasons for Burying the Bodies of the Saints.</h2>

<p>Nevertheless the bodies of the dead are not on this account to be despised and left unburied; least of all the bodies of the righteous and faithful, which have been used by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> as His organs and instruments for all good works. For if the dress of a father, or his ring, or anything he wore, be precious to his children, in proportion to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> they bore him, with how much more reason ought we to care for the bodies of those we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which they wore far more closely and intimately than any clothing! For the body is not an extraneous ornament or aid, but a part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> very nature. And therefore to the righteous of ancient times the last offices were piously rendered, and sepulchres provided for them, and obsequies celebrated;  and they themselves, while yet alive, gave commandment to their sons about the burial, and, on occasion, even about the removal of their bodies to some favorite place.  And Tobit, according to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> testimony, is commended, and is said to have pleased God by burying the dead. <span class="stiki" id="note120070"><a href="../bible/tob012.htm#verse12">Tobit&nbsp;12:12</a></span> Our Lord Himself, too, though He was to rise again the third day, applauds, and commends to our applause, the good work of the religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who poured precious ointment over His limbs, and did it against His burial. <span class="stiki" id="note120071"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;26:10-13</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> speaks with commendation of those who were careful to take down His body from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and wrap it lovingly in costly cerements, and see to its burial. <span class="stiki" id="note120072"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;19:38</a></span> These instances certainly do not prove that corpses have any feeling; but they show that God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> extends even to the bodies of the dead, and that such <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> offices are pleasing to Him, as cherishing <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the resurrection. And we may also draw from them this wholesome lesson, that if God does not forget even any kind office which loving care pays to the unconscious dead, much more does He reward the charity we exercise towards the living. Other things, indeed, which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> patriarchs said of the burial and removal of their bodies, they meant to be taken in a prophetic sense; but of these we need not here speak at large, what we have already said being sufficient. But if the want of those things which are necessary for the support of the living, as food and clothing, though painful and trying, does not break down the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> endurance of good men, nor eradicate <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> from their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, but rather renders it more fruitful, how much less can the absence of the funeral, and of the other customary attentions paid to the dead, render those wretched who are already reposing in the hidden abodes of the blessed! Consequently, though in the sack of Rome and of other towns the dead bodies of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were deprived of these last offices, this is neither the fault of the living, for they could not render them; nor an infliction to the dead, for they cannot feel the loss.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; Of the Captivity of the Saints, and that Divine Consolation Never Failed Them Therein.</h2>

<p>But, say they, many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were even led away captive. This indeed were a most pitiable <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, if they could be led away to any place where they could not find their God. But for this calamity also sacred Scripture affords great consolation. The three youths <span class="stiki" id="note120073"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm">Daniel&nbsp;3</a></span> were captives; Daniel was a captive; so were other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the comforter, did not fail them. And in like manner He has not failed His own people in the power of a nation which, though barbarous, is yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>&mdash;He who did not abandon the <a href="../cathen/08497b.htm">prophet</a> in the belly of a monster. <span class="stiki" id="note120074"><a href="../bible/jon001.htm">Jonah 1</a></span> These things, indeed, are turned to ridicule rather than credited by those with whom we are debating; though they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what they read in their own books, that Arion of Methymna, the famous lyrist,  when he was thrown overboard, was received on a dolphin's back and carried to land. But that story of ours about the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jonah is far more incredible&mdash;more incredible because more marvellous, and more marvellous because a greater exhibition of power.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; Of Regulus, in Whom We Have an Example of the Voluntary Endurance of Captivity for the Sake of Religion; Which Yet Did Not Profit Him, Though He Was a Worshipper of the Gods.</h2>

<p>But among their own famous men they have  a very noble example of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> endurance of captivity in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to a religious scruple. Marcus Attilius Regulus, a Roman general, was a prisoner in the hands of the Carthaginians. But they, being more anxious to exchange their prisoners with the Romans than to keep them, sent Regulus as a special envoy with their own embassadors to negotiate this exchange, but bound him first with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, that if he failed to accomplish their wish, he would return to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>. He went and persuaded the senate to the opposite course, because he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it was not for the advantage of the Roman republic to make an exchange of prisoners. After he had thus exerted his influence, the Romans did not compel him to return to the enemy; but what he had <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> he voluntarily performed. But the Carthaginians put him to death with refined, elaborate, and horrible tortures. They shut him up in a narrow box, in which he was compelled to stand, and in which finely sharpened nails were fixed all round about him, so that he could not lean upon any part of it without intense pain; and so they killed him by depriving him of sleep.  With <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, indeed, do they applaud the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which rose superior to so frightful a <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>. However, the gods he swore by were those who are now supposed to avenge the prohibition of their worship, by inflicting these present calamities on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. But if these gods, who were worshipped specially in this behalf, that they might confer <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in this life, either willed or permitted these punishments to be inflicted on one who kept his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to them, what more cruel punishment could they in their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> have inflicted on a <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjured</a> person? But why may I not draw from my reasoning a double inference? Regulus certainly had such reverence for the gods, that for his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath's</a> sake he would neither remain in his own land nor go elsewhere, but without hesitation returned to his bitterest enemies. If he thought that this course would be advantageous with respect to this present life, he was certainly much deceived, for it brought his life to a frightful termination. By his own example, in fact, he taught that the gods do not secure the temporal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of their worshippers; since he himself, who was devoted to their worship, as both conquered in battle and taken prisoner, and then, because he refused to act in violation of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> he had <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> by them, was tortured and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by a new, and hitherto unheard of, and all too horrible kind of punishment. And on the supposition that the worshippers of the gods are rewarded by felicity in the life to come, why, then, do they <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> the influence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>? Why do they assert that this disaster has overtaken the city because it has ceased to worship its gods, since, worship them as assiduously as it may, it may yet be as unfortunate as Regulus was? Or will some one carry so wonderful a blindness to the extent of wildly attempting, in the face of the evident <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to contend that though one man might be unfortunate, though a worshipper of the gods, yet a whole city could not be so? That is to say, the power of their gods is better adapted to preserve multitudes than individuals,&mdash; as if a multitude were not composed of individuals.</p>

<p>But if they say that M. Regulus, even while a prisoner and enduring these bodily torments, might yet enjoy the blessedness of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,  then let them recognize that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by which a city also may be blessed. For the blessedness of a community and of an individual flow from the same source; for a community is nothing else than a harmonious collection of individuals. So that I am not concerned meantime to discuss what kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> Regulus possessed; enough, that by his very noble example they are forced to own that the gods are to be worshipped not for the sake of bodily comforts or external advantages; for he preferred to lose all such things rather than offend the gods by whom he had <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a>. But what can we make of men who <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in having such a citizen, but dread having a city like him? If they do not dread this, then let them acknowledge that some such calamity as befell Regulus may also befall a community, though they be worshipping their gods as diligently as he; and let them no longer throw the blame of their misfortunes on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. But as our present concern is with those <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who were taken prisoners, let those who take occasion from this calamity to revile our most wholesome religion in a fashion not less imprudent than impudent, consider this and hold their peace; for if it was no reproach to their gods that a most punctilious worshipper of theirs should, for the sake of keeping his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to them, be deprived of his native land without hope of finding another, and fall into the hands of his enemies, and be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by a long-drawn and exquisite torture, much less ought the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name to be charged with the captivity of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in its power, since they, in confident expectation of a heavenly country, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are pilgrims even in their own homes.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; Of the Violation of the Consecrated and Other Christian Virgins, to Which They Were Subjected in Captivity and to Which Their Own Will Gave No Consent; And Whether This Contaminated Their Souls.</h2>

<p>But they fancy they bring a conclusive charge against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, when they aggravate the horror of captivity by adding that not only wives and unmarried maidens, but even <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, were violated. But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, with respect to this, it is not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, nor even the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, which is hemmed into any difficulty; the only difficulty is so to treat the subject as to satisfy at once modesty and reason. And in discussing it we shall not be so careful to reply to our accusers as to comfort our friends. Let this, therefore, in the first place, be laid down as an unassailable position, that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which makes the life good has its throne in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and thence rules the members of the body, which becomes <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the will; and that while the will remains firm and unshaken, nothing that another person does with the body, or upon the body, is any fault of the person who suffers it, so long as he cannot escape it without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But as not only pain may be inflicted, but <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> gratified on the body of another, whenever anything of this latter kind takes place, shame invades even a thoroughly pure spirit from which modesty has not departed&mdash;shame, lest that act which could not be suffered without some sensual pleasure, should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have been committed also with some assent of the will.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.&mdash; Of Suicide Committed Through Fear of Punishment or Dishonor.</h2>

<p>And consequently, even if some of these <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> killed themselves to avoid such disgrace, who that has any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feeling would refuse to forgive them? And as for those who would not put an end to their lives, lest they might seem to escape the crime of another by a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of their own, he who lays this to their charge as a great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is himself not guiltless of the fault of folly. For if it is not lawful to take the law into our own hands, and slay even a guilty person, whose death no public sentence has warranted, then certainly he who kills himself is a homicide, and so much the guiltier of his own death, as he was more innocent of that offense for which he doomed himself to die. Do we <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> execrate the deed of Judas, and does <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself pronounce that by hanging himself he rather aggravated than expiated the guilt of that most iniquitous betrayal, since, by despairing of God's mercy in his sorrow that wrought death, he left to himself no place for a healing penitence? How much more ought he to abstain from laying violent hands on himself who has done nothing worthy of such a punishment! For Judas, when he killed himself, killed a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man; but he passed from this life chargeable not only with the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but with his own: for though he killed himself on account of his crime, his killing himself was another crime. Why, then, should a man who has done no ill do ill to himself, and by killing himself kill the innocent to escape another's guilty act, and perpetrate upon himself a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of his own, that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of another may not be perpetrated on him?</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; Of the Violence Which May Be Done to the Body by Another's Lust, While the Mind Remains Inviolate.</h2>

<p>But is there a <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that even another's <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> may pollute the violated? It will not pollute, if it be another's: if it pollute, it is not another's, but is shared also by the polluted. But since purity is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and has for its companion <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> which will rather endure all ills than consent to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and since no one, however magnanimous and pure, has always the disposal of his own body, but can control only the consent and refusal of his will, what sane man can suppose that, if his body be seized and forcibly made use of to satisfy the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of another, he thereby loses his purity? For if purity can be thus destroyed, then assuredly purity is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; nor can it be numbered among those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things by which the life is made good, but among the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the body, in the same category as strength, beauty, sound and unbroken health, and, in short, all such <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things as may be diminished without at all diminishing the goodness and rectitude of our life. But if purity be nothing better than these, why should the body be perilled that it may be preserved? If, on the other hand, it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, then not even when the body is violated is it lost. Nay more, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> continence, when it resists the uncleanness of carnal <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, sanctifies even the body, and therefore when this continence remains unsubdued, even the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the body is preserved, because the will to use it holily remains, and, so far as lies in the body itself, the power also.</p>

<p>For the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the body does not consist in the integrity of its members, nor in their exemption from all touch; for they are  exposed to various accidents which do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to and wound them, and the surgeons who administer relief often perform operations that sicken the spectator. A midwife, suppose, has (whether maliciously or accidentally, or through unskillfulness) destroyed the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of some girl, while endeavoring to ascertain it: I suppose no one is so foolish as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, by this destruction of the integrity of one organ, the virgin has lost anything even of her bodily <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. And thus, so long as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> keeps this firmness of purpose which sanctifies even the body, the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> done by another's <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> makes no impression on this bodily <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, which is preserved intact by one's own persistent continence. Suppose a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> violates the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> she has <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and goes to meet her seducer with the intention of yielding to him, shall we say that as she goes she is possessed even of bodily <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, when already she has lost and destroyed that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which sanctifies the body? Far be it from us to so misapply words. Let us rather draw this conclusion, that while the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> remains even when the body is violated, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the body is not lost; and that, in like manner, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the body is lost when the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is violated, though the body itself remains intact. And therefore a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who has been violated by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of another, and without any consent of her own, has no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to put herself to death; much less has she <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to commit suicide in order to avoid such violation, for in that case she commits certain homicide to prevent a crime which is uncertain as yet, and not her own.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; Of Lucretia, Who Put an End to Her Life Because of the Outrage Done Her.</h2>

<p>This, then, is our position, and it seems sufficiently lucid. We maintain that when a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is violated while her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> admits no consent to the iniquity, but remains inviolably chaste, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not hers, but his who violates her. But do they against whom we have to defend not only the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, but the sacred bodies too of these outraged <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> captives,&mdash; do they, perhaps, dare to dispute our position? But all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how loudly they extol the purity of Lucretia, that noble matron of ancient Rome. When King Tarquin's son had violated her body, she made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of this young profligate to her husband Collatinus, and to Brutus her kinsman, men of high rank and full of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and bound them by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to avenge it. Then, heart-sick, and unable to bear the shame, she put an end to her life. What shall we call her? An adulteress, or chaste? There is no question which she was. Not more happily than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> did a declaimer say of this sad occurrence: <q>Here was a marvel: there were two, and only one committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.</q> Most forcibly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> spoken. For this declaimer, seeing in the union of the two bodies the foul <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the one, and the chaste will of the other, and giving heed not to the contact of the bodily members, but to the wide diversity of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, says: <q>There were two, but the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> was committed only by one.</q></p>

<p>But how is it, that she who was no partner to the crime bears the heavier punishment of the two? For the adulterer was only banished along with his father; she suffered the extreme penalty. If that was not impurity by which she was unwillingly ravished, then this is not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by which she, being chaste, is punished. To you I appeal, you <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and judges of Rome. Even after the perpetration of great enormities, you do not suffer the criminal to be slain untried. If, then, one were to bring to your bar this case, and were to prove to you that a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> not only untried, but chaste and innocent, had been killed, would you not visit the murderer with punishment proportionably severe? This crime was committed by Lucretia; that Lucretia so celebrated and lauded slew the innocent, chaste, outraged Lucretia. Pronounce sentence. But if you cannot, because there does not appear any one whom you can punish, why do you extol with such unmeasured laudation her who slew an innocent and chaste <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? Assuredly you will find it impossible to defend her before the judges of the realms below, if they be such as your poets are fond of representing them; for she is among those</p>

<blockquote><p>Who guiltless sent themselves to doom,

<br>And all for loathing of the day,

<br>In <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> threw their lives away.

<br>And if she with the others wishes to return,

<p>Fate bars the way: around their keep

<br>The slow unlovely waters creep,

<br>And bind with ninefold chain. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>Or perhaps she is not there, because she slew herself conscious of guilt, not of innocence? She herself alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> her reason; but what if she was betrayed by the pleasure of the act, and gave some consent to Sextus, though so violently abusing her, and then was so affected with remorse, that she thought death alone could expiate her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Even though this were the case, she ought still to have held her hand from suicide, if she could with her false  gods have accomplished a fruitful repentance. However, if such were the state of the case, and if it were false that there were two, but one only committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> were that both were involved in it, one by open assault, the other by secret consent, then she did not kill an innocent <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; and therefore her erudite defenders may maintain that she is not among that class of the dwellers below <q>who guiltless sent themselves to doom.</q> But this case of Lucretia is in such a dilemma, that if you extenuate the homicide, you confirm the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>: if you acquit her of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, you make the charge of homicide heavier; and there is no way out of the dilemma, when one asks, If she was adulterous, why praise her? If chaste, why slay her?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for our purpose of refuting those who are unable to comprehend what <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> is, and who therefore insult over our outraged <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, it is enough that in the instance of this noble Roman matron it was said in her praise, <q>There were two, but the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> was the crime of only one.</q> For Lucretia was confidently <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be superior to the contamination of any consenting thought to the <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. And accordingly, since she killed herself for being subjected to an outrage in which she had no guilty part, it is obvious that this act of hers was prompted not by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of purity, but by the overwhelming burden of her shame. She was ashamed that so foul a crime had been perpetrated upon her, though without her abetting; and this matron, with the Roman <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in her veins, was seized with a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> dread that, if she continued to live, it would be supposed she willingly did not resent the wrong that had been done her. She could not exhibit to men her <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> but she judged that her self-inflicted punishment would testify her state of mind; and she burned with shame at the thought that her patient endurance of the foul affront that another had done her, should be construed into complicity with him. Not such was the decision of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who suffered as she did, and yet survive. They declined to avenge upon themselves the guilt of others, and so add crimes of their own to those crimes in which they had no share. For this they would have done had their shame driven them to homicide, as the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of their enemies had driven them to <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Within their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of their own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, they enjoy the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. In the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, too, they are esteemed pure, and this contents them; they ask no more: it suffices them to have opportunity of doing good, and they decline to evade the distress of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> suspicion, lest they thereby deviate from the divine law.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; That Christians Have No Authority for Committing Suicide in Any Circumstances Whatever.</h2>

<p>It is not without significance, that in no passage of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> canonical books there can be found either divine precept or permission to take away our own life, whether for the sake of entering on the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, or of shunning, or ridding ourselves of anything whatever. Nay, the law, rightly interpreted, even prohibits suicide, where it says, <q>You shall not kill.</q> This is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> especially by the omission of the words <q>your neighbor,</q> which are inserted when false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is forbidden: <q>You shall not bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against your neighbor.</q> Nor yet should any one on this account suppose he has not broken this commandment if he has borne false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> only against himself. &nbsp;For the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of our neighbor is regulated by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of ourselves, as it is written, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbor as yourself.</q> If, then, he who makes false statements about himself is not less guilty of bearing false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> than if he had made them to the injury of his neighbor; although in the commandment prohibiting false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> only his neighbor is mentioned, and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> taking no pains to understand it might suppose that a man was allowed to be a false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to his own hurt; how much greater reason have we to understand that a man may not kill himself, since in the commandment, <q>You shall not kill,</q> there is no limitation added nor any exception made in favor of any one, and least of all in favor of him on whom the command is laid! And so some attempt to extend this command even to beasts and cattle, as if it forbade us to take life from any creature. But if so, why not extend it also to the plants, and all that is rooted in and nourished by the earth? For though this class of creatures have no sensation, yet they also are said to live, and consequently they can die; and therefore, if <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> be done them, can be killed. So, too, the apostle, when speaking of the seeds of such things as these, says, <q>That which you sow is not quickened except it die;</q> and in the Psalm it is said, <q>He killed their vines with hail.</q> Must we therefore reckon it a breaking of this commandment, <q>You shall not kill,</q> to pull a flower? Are we thus insanely to countenance the foolish <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>? Putting aside, then, these ravings, if, when we say, You shall not kill, we do not understand this of the plants, since they have no sensation,  nor of the irrational animals that fly, swim, walk, or creep, since they are dissociated from us by their want of reason, and are therefore by the just appointment of the Creator subjected to us to kill or keep alive for our own uses; if so, then it remains that we understand that commandment simply of man. The commandment is, <q>You shall not kill man;</q> therefore neither another nor yourself, for he who kills himself still kills nothing else than man.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.&mdash; Of the Cases in Which We May Put Men to Death Without Incurring the Guilt of Murder.</h2>

<p>However, there are some exceptions made by the divine authority to its own law, that men may not be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. These exceptions are of two kinds, being justified either by a general law, or by a special commission granted for a time to some individual. And in this latter case, he to whom authority is delegated, and who is but the sword in the hand of him who uses it, is not himself responsible for the death he deals. And, accordingly, they who have waged <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the divine command, or in conformity with His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, have represented in their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> the public <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or the wisdom of government, and in this capacity have <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men; such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have by no means violated the commandment, <q>You shall not kill.</q> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> indeed was not merely deemed guiltless of cruelty, but was even applauded for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, because he was ready to slay his son in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not to his own passion. And it is reasonably enough made a question, whether we are to esteem it to have been in compliance with a command of God that Jephthah killed his daughter, because she met him when he had vowed that he would <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to God whatever first met him as he returned victorious from battle. Samson, too, who drew down the house on himself and his foes together, is justified only on this ground, that the Spirit who wrought wonders by him had given him secret instructions to do this. With the exception, then, of these two classes of cases, which are justified either by a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> law that applies generally, or by a special intimation from God Himself, the fountain of all <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whoever kills a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, either himself or another, is implicated in the guilt of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; That Suicide Can Never Be Prompted by Magnanimity.</h2>

<p>But they who have laid violent hands on themselves are perhaps to be admired for their greatness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, though they cannot be applauded for the soundness of their judgment. However, if you look at the matter more closely, you will scarcely call it greatness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which prompts a man to kill himself rather than bear up against some hardships of fortune, or <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in which he is not implicated. Is it not rather <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of a feeble <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to be unable to bear either the pains of bodily servitude or the foolish opinion of the vulgar? And is not that to be pronounced the greater <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which rather faces than flees the ills of life, and which, in comparison of the light and purity of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, holds in small esteem the judgment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and specially of the vulgar, which is frequently involved in a mist of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>? And, therefore, if suicide is to be esteemed a magnanimous act, none can take higher rank for magnanimity than that Cleombrotus, who (as the story goes), when he had read <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> book in which he treats of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, threw himself from a wall, and so passed from this life to that which he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be better. For he was not hard pressed by calamity, nor by any accusation, false or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, which he could not very well have lived down; there was, in short, no motive but only magnanimity urging him to seek death, and break away from the sweet detention of this life. And yet that this was a magnanimous rather than a justifiable action, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> himself, whom he had read, would have told him; for he would certainly have been forward to commit, or at least to recommend suicide, had not the same bright <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> which saw that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, discerned also that to seek <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> by suicide was to be prohibited rather than encouraged.</p>

<p>Again, it is said many have killed themselves to prevent an enemy doing so. But we are not inquiring whether it has been done, but whether it ought to have been done. Sound judgment is to be preferred even to examples, and indeed examples harmonize with the voice of reason; but not all examples, but those only which are distinguished by their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and are proportionately worthy of imitation. For suicide we cannot cite the example of patriarchs, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, or <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; though <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, when He admonished them to flee from city to city if they were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, might very well have taken that occasion to advise them to lay violent hands on themselves, and so escape their persecutors. But seeing He did not do this, nor proposed this mode of departing this life, though He were addressing His own friends for whom He had promised to prepare everlasting mansions, it is obvious that such ex  amples as are produced from the <q>nations that forget <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> give no warrant of imitation to the worshippers of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.&mdash; What We are to Think of the Example of Cato, Who Slew Himself Because Unable to Endure C&aelig;sar's Victory.</h2>

<p>Besides Lucretia, of whom enough has already been said, our advocates of suicide have some difficulty in finding any other prescriptive example, unless it be that of Cato, who killed himself at Utica. His example is appealed to, not because he was the only man who did so, but because he was so esteemed as a learned and excellent man, that it could plausibly be maintained that what he did was and is a good thing to do. But of this action of his, what can I say but that his own friends, enlightened men as he, prudently dissuaded him, and therefore judged his act to be that of a feeble rather than a strong spirit, and dictated not by <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> feeling forestalling shame, but by weakness shrinking from hardships? Indeed, Cato condemns himself by the advice he gave to his dearly loved son. For if it was a disgrace to live under C&aelig;sar's rule, why did the father urge the son to this disgrace, by encouraging him to trust absolutely to C&aelig;sar's generosity? Why did he not persuade him to die along with himself? If Torquatus was applauded for putting his son to death, when contrary to orders he had engaged, and engaged successfully, with the enemy, why did conquered Cato spare his conquered son, though he did not spare himself? Was it more disgraceful to be a victor contrary to orders, than to submit to a victor contrary to the received ideas of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>? Cato, then, cannot have deemed it to be shameful to live under C&aelig;sar's rule; for had he done so, the father's sword would have delivered his son from this disgrace. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, that his son, whom he both hoped and desired would be spared by C&aelig;sar, was not more loved by him than C&aelig;sar was envied the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of pardoning him (as indeed C&aelig;sar himself is reported to have said ); or if <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is too strong a word, let us say he was <em>ashamed</em> that this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> should be his.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.&mdash; That in that Virtue in Which Regulus Excels Cato, Christians are Pre-Eminently Distinguished.</h2>

<p>Our opponents are offended at our preferring to Cato the saintly Job, who endured dreadful <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> in his body rather than deliver himself from all torment by self-inflicted death; or other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, of whom it is recorded in our authoritative and trustworthy books that they bore captivity and the oppression of their enemies rather than commit suicide. But their own books authorize us to prefer to Marcus Cato, Marcus Regulus. For Cato had never conquered C&aelig;sar; and when conquered by him, disdained to submit himself to him, and that he might escape this submission put himself to death. Regulus, on the contrary, had formerly conquered the Carthaginians, and in command of the army of Rome had won for the Roman republic a victory which no citizen could bewail, and which the enemy himself was constrained to admire; yet afterwards, when he in his turn was defeated by them, he preferred to be their captive rather than to put himself beyond their reach by suicide. Patient under the domination of the Carthaginians, and constant in his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Romans, he neither deprived the one of his conquered body, nor the other of his unconquered spirit. Neither was it <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of life that prevented him from killing himself. This was plainly enough indicated by his unhesitatingly returning, on account of his promise and <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, to the same enemies whom he had more grievously provoked by his words in the senate than even by his arms in battle. Having such a contempt of life, and preferring to end it by whatever torments excited enemies might contrive, rather than terminate it by his own hand, he could not more distinctly have declared how great a crime he judged suicide to be. Among all their famous and remarkable citizens, the Romans have no better man to boast of than this, who was neither corrupted by prosperity, for he remained a very poor man after winning such victories; nor broken by adversity, for he returned intrepidly to the most miserable end. But if the bravest and most renowned heroes, who had but an earthly country to defend, and who, though they had but false gods, yet rendered them a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worship, and carefully kept their <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to them; if these men, who by the custom and right of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> put conquered enemies to the sword, yet shrank from putting an end to their own lives even when conquered by their enemies; if, though they had no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> at all of death, they would yet rather suffer slavery than commit suicide, how much rather must <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, the worshippers of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the aspirants to a heavenly citizenship, shrink from this act, if in God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> they have been for a season delivered into the hands of their enemies to prove or to correct them! And certainly, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> subjected to this humiliating condition will not be deserted by the Most High, who for their sakes  humbled Himself. Neither should they forget that they are bound by no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, nor military orders, to put even a conquered enemy to the sword; and if a man may not <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> the enemy who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, or may yet <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against him, who is so infatuated as to maintain that he may kill himself because an enemy has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, or is going to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, against him?</p>

<h2>Chapter 25.&mdash; That We Should Not Endeavor By Sin to Obviate Sin.</h2>

<p>But, we are told, there is ground to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that, when the body is subjected to the enemy's <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, the insidious pleasure of sense may entice the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to consent to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and steps must be taken to prevent so disastrous a result. And is not suicide the proper mode of preventing not only the enemy's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> so allured? Now, in the first place, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is led by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His wisdom, rather than by bodily concupiscence, will certainly never consent to the desire aroused in its own flesh by another's <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. And, at all events, if it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> plainly declares, that suicide is a detestable and damnable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, who is such a fool as to say, Let us <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> now, that we may obviate a possible future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; let us now commit <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, lest we perhaps afterwards should commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>? If we are so controlled by iniquity that innocence is out of the question, and we can at best but make a choice of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is not a future and uncertain <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> preferable to a present and certain <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>? Is it not better to commit a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> which penitence may heal, than a crime which leaves no place for healing contrition? I say this for the sake of those men or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> they may be enticed into consenting to their violator's <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and think they should lay violent hands on themselves, and so prevent, not another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but their own. But far be it from the mind of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> confiding in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and resting in the hope of His aid; far be it, I say, from such a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to yield a shameful consent to pleasures of the flesh, howsoever presented. And if that lustful disobedience, which still dwells in our mortal members, follows its own law irrespective of our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, surely its motions in the body of one who rebels against them are as blameless as its motions in the body of one who sleeps.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.&mdash; That in Certain Peculiar Cases the Examples of the Saints are Not to Be Followed.</h2>

<p>But, they say, in the time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> some <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> escaped those who menaced them with outrage, by casting themselves into rivers which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> would drown them; and having died in this manner, they are venerated in the Catholic Church as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> I do not presume to speak rashly. I cannot tell whether there may not have been vouchsafed to the church some divine authority, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by trustworthy evidences, for so honoring their memory: it may be that it is so. It may be they were not deceived by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment, but prompted by divine wisdom, to their act of self-destruction. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this was the case with Samson. And when God enjoins any act, and intimates by plain evidence that He has enjoined it, who will call <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> criminal? Who will accuse so religious a submission? But then every man is not justified in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> his son to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was commendable in so doing. The soldier who has slain a man in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the authority under which he is lawfully commissioned, is not accused of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> by any law of his state; nay, if he has not slain him, it is then he is accused of treason to the state, and of despising the law. But if he has been acting on his own authority, and at his own impulse, he has in this case incurred the crime of shedding <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> blood. And thus he is punished for doing without orders the very thing he is punished for neglecting to do when he has been ordered. If the commands of a general make so great a difference, shall the commands of God make none? He, then, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it is unlawful to kill himself, may nevertheless do so if he is ordered by Him whose commands we may not neglect. Only let him be very sure that the divine command has been signified. As for us, we can become privy to the secrets of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> only in so far as these are disclosed to us, and so far only do we judge: <q>No one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, save the spirit of man which is in him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120080"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> But this we affirm, this we maintain, this we every way pronounce to be right, that no man ought to inflict on himself <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> death, for this is to escape the ills of time by plunging into those of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; that no man ought to do so on account of another man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for this were to escape a guilt which could not pollute him, by incurring great guilt of his own; that no man ought to do so on account of his own past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for he has all the more need of this life that these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be healed by repentance; that no man should put an end to this life to obtain that better life we look for after death, for  those who die by their own hand have no better life after death.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27.&mdash; Whether Voluntary Death Should Be Sought in Order to Avoid Sin.</h2>

<p>There remains one reason for suicide which I mentioned before, and which is thought a sound one&mdash;namely, to prevent one's falling into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> either through the blandishments of pleasure or the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of pain. If this reason were a good one, then we should be impelled to exhort men at once to destroy themselves, as soon as they have been washed in the laver of regeneration, and have received the forgiveness of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Then is the time to escape all future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when all past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is blotted out. And if this escape be lawfully secured by suicide, why not then specially? Why does any <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> person hold his hand from taking his own life? Why does any person who is freed from the hazards of this life again expose himself to them, when he has power so easily to rid himself of them all, and when it is written, <q>He who loves danger shall fall into it?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120081"><a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse27">Sirach&nbsp;3:27</a></span> Why does he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, or at least face, so many serious dangers, by remaining in this life from which he may legitimately depart? But is any one so blinded and twisted in his moral nature, and so far astray from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as to think that, though a man ought to make away with himself for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of being led into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by the oppression of one man, his master, he ought yet to live, and so expose himself to the hourly <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of this world, both to all those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which the oppression of one master involves, and to numberless other miseries in which this life inevitably implicates us? What reason, then, is there for our consuming time in those exhortations by which we seek to animate the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, either to virginal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, or vidual continence, or matrimonial fidelity, when we have so much more simple and compendious a method of deliverance from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by persuading those who are fresh from <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to put an end to their lives, and so pass to their Lord pure and well-conditioned? If any one thinks that such persuasion should be attempted, I say not he is foolish, but mad. With what face, then, can he say to any man, <q>Kill yourself, lest to your small <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you add a heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, while you live under an unchaste master, whose conduct is that of a barbarian?</q> How can he say this, if he cannot without <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> say, <q>Kill yourself, now that you are washed from all your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, lest you fall again into similar or even aggravated <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, while you live in a world which has such power to allure by its unclean pleasures, to torment by its horrible cruelties, to overcome by its <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and terrors?</q> It is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to say this; it is therefore <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to kill oneself. For if there could be any just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of suicide, this were so. And since not even this is so, there is none.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28.&mdash; By What Judgment of God the Enemy Was Permitted to Indulge His Lust on the Bodies of Continent Christians.</h2>

<p>Let not your life, then, be a burden to you, you faithful servants of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, though your <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> was made the sport of your enemies. You have a grand and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> consolation, if you maintain a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you did not consent to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those who were permitted to commit sinful outrage upon you. And if you should ask why this permission was granted, indeed it is a deep <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of the Creator and Governor of the world; and <q>unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120082"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse33">Romans&nbsp;11:33</a></span> Nevertheless, faithfully interrogate your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, whether you have not been unduly puffed up by your integrity, and continence, and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; and whether you have not been so desirous of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise that is accorded to these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, that you have envied some who possessed them. I, for my part, do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your hearts, and therefore I make no accusation; I do not even hear what your hearts answer when you question them. And yet, if they answer that it is as I have supposed it might be, do not marvel that you have lost that by which you can win men's praise, and retain that which cannot be exhibited to men. If you did not consent to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it was because God added His aid to His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that it might not be lost, and because shame before men succeeded to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that it might not be loved. But in both respects even the faint-hearted among you have a consolation, approved by the one experience, chastened by the other; justified by the one, corrected by the other. As to those whose hearts, when interrogated, reply that they have never been <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, widowhood, or matrimonial <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, but, condescending to those of low estate, rejoiced with trembling in these gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that they have never envied any one the like excellences of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and purity, but rose superior to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> applause, which is wont to be abundant in proportion to the rarity of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> applauded, and rather desired that their own number be increased,  than that by the smallness of their numbers each of them should be conspicuous&mdash;even such faithful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, I say, must not complain that permission was given to the barbarians so grossly to outrage them; nor must they allow themselves to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God overlooked their character when He permitted acts which no one with impunity commits. For some most flagrant and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> desires are allowed free play at present by the secret judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are reserved to the public and final judgment. Moreover, it is possible that those <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who are unconscious of any undue <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> on account of their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, whereby they sinlessly suffered the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of their captors, had yet some lurking infirmity which might have betrayed them into a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and contemptuous bearing, had they not been subjected to the humiliation that befell them in the taking of the city. As, therefore, some men were removed by death, that no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> might change their disposition, so these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were outraged lest prosperity should corrupt their modesty. Neither those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> then, who were already puffed up by the circumstance that they were still <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, nor those who might have been so puffed up had they not been exposed to the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the enemy, lost their <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, but rather gained humility; the former were saved from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> already cherished, the latter from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> that would shortly have grown upon them.</p>

<p>We must further notice that some of those sufferers may have conceived that continence is a bodily good, and abides so long as the body is inviolate, and did not understand that the purity both of the body and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> rests on the steadfastness of the will strengthened by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and cannot be forcibly taken from an unwilling person. From this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> they are probably now delivered. For when they reflect how conscientiously they served <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and when they settle again to the firm persuasion that He can in nowise desert those who so serve Him, and so invoke His aid and when they consider, what they cannot <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, how pleasing to Him is <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, they are shut up to the conclusion that He could never have permitted these disasters to befall His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, if by them that saintliness could be destroyed which He Himself had bestowed upon them, and delights to see in them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29.&mdash; What the Servants of Christ Should Say in Reply to the Unbelievers Who Cast in Their Teeth that Christ Did Not Rescue Them from the Fury of Their Enemies.</h2>

<p>The whole <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, most high and most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, has therefore a consolation of its own&mdash;a consolation which cannot deceive, and which has in it a surer hope than the tottering and falling affairs of earth can afford. They will not refuse the discipline of this temporal life, in which they are schooled for life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; nor will they lament their experience of it, for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of earth they use as pilgrims who are not detained by them, and its ills either prove or improve them. As for those who insult over them in their trials, and when ills befall them say, <q>Where is your God?</q>  we may ask them where their gods are when they suffer the very calamities for the sake of avoiding which they worship their gods, or maintain they ought to be worshipped; for the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Christ is furnished with its reply: our God is everywhere present, wholly everywhere; not confined to any place. He can be present unperceived, and be absent without moving; when He exposes us to adversities, it is either to prove our perfections or correct our imperfections; and in return for our patient endurance of the sufferings of time, He reserves for us an everlasting reward. But who are you, that we should deign to speak with you even about your own gods, much less about our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is <q>to be feared above all gods? For all the gods of the nations are <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; but the Lord made the heavens.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 30.&mdash; That Those Who Complain of Christianity Really Desire to Live Without Restraint in Shameful Luxury.</h2>

<p>If the famous Scipio Nasica were now alive, who was once your pontiff, and was unanimously chosen by the senate, when, in the panic created by the Punic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, they sought for the best citizen to entertain the Phrygian goddess, he would curb this shamelessness of yours, though you would perhaps scarcely dare to look upon the countenance of such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For why in your calamities do you complain of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, unless because you desire to enjoy your luxurious license unrestrained, and to lead an abandoned and profligate life without the interruption of any uneasiness or disaster? For certainly your desire for peace, and prosperity, and plenty is not prompted by any purpose of using these blessings honestly, that is to say, with moderation, sobriety, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; for your purpose rather is to run riot in an endless variety of sottish pleasures, and thus to generate from your prosperity a moral pestilence which will prove a thousandfold more disastrous than the fiercest enemies. It was  such a calamity as this that Scipio, your chief pontiff, your best man in the judgment of the whole senate, feared when he refused to agree to the destruction of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, Rome's rival and opposed Cato, who advised its destruction. He feared security, that enemy of weak minds, and he perceived that a wholesome <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> would be a fit guardian for the citizens. And he was not mistaken; the event <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> how wisely he had spoken. For when <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> was destroyed, and the Roman republic delivered from its great <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of anxiety, a crowd of disastrous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> immediately resulted from the prosperous condition of things. First concord was weakened, and destroyed by fierce and bloody seditions; then followed, by a concatenation of baleful causes, civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, which brought in their train such massacres, such bloodshed, such lawless and cruel proscription and plunder, that those Romans who, in the days of their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, had expected injury only at the hands of their enemies, now that their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was lost, suffered greater cruelties at the hands of their fellow citizens. The <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of rule, which with other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> among the Romans in more unmitigated intensity than among any other people, after it had taken possession of the more powerful few, subdued under its yoke the rest, worn and wearied.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31.&mdash; By What Steps the Passion for Governing Increased Among the Romans.</h2>

<p>For at what stage would that passion rest when once it has lodged in a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> spirit, until by a succession of advances it has reached even the throne. And to obtain such advances nothing avails but unscrupulous ambition. But unscrupulous ambition has nothing to work upon, save in a nation corrupted by <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and luxury. Moreover, a people becomes avaricious and luxurious by prosperity; and it was this which that very <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> man Nasica was endeavouring to avoid when he opposed the destruction of the greatest, strongest, wealthiest city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome's</a> enemy. He thought that thus <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> would act as a curb on <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> being curbed would not run riot in luxury, and that luxury being prevented <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> would be at an end; and that these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> being banished, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> would flourish and increase the great profit of the state; and liberty, the fit companion of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, would abide unfettered. For similar reasons, and animated by the same considerate patriotism, that same chief pontiff of yours&mdash; I still refer to him who was adjudged Rome's best man without one dissentient voice&mdash; threw cold water on the proposal of the senate to build a circle of seats round the theatre, and in a very weighty speech warned them against allowing the luxurious manners of Greece to sap the Roman manliness, and persuaded them not to yield to the enervating and emasculating influence of foreign licentiousness. So authoritative and forcible were his words, that the senate was moved to prohibit the use even of those benches which hitherto had been customarily brought to the theatre for the temporary use of the citizens.  How eagerly would such a man as this have banished from Rome the scenic exhibitions themselves, had he dared to oppose the authority of those whom he supposed to be gods! For he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they were malicious devils; or if he did, he supposed they should rather be propitiated than despised. For there had not yet been revealed to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> the heavenly doctrine which should purify their hearts by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and transform their natural disposition by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> godliness, and turn them from the service of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> devils to seek the things that are in heaven, or even above the heavens.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32.&mdash; Of the Establishment of Scenic Entertainments.</h2>

<p>Know then, you who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this, and you who feign <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> be reminded, while you murmur against Him who has freed you from such rulers, that the scenic games, exhibitions of shameless folly and license, were established at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, not by men's vicious cravings, but by the appointment of your gods. Much more pardonably might you have rendered divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> to Scipio than to such gods as these. The gods were not so moral as their pontiff. But give me now your attention, if your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, inebriated by its deep potations of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, can take in any sober <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The gods enjoined that games be exhibited in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to stay a physical pestilence; their pontiff prohibited the theatre from being constructed, to prevent a moral pestilence. If, then, there remains in you sufficient mental enlightenment to prefer the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the body, choose whom you will worship. Besides, though the pestilence was stayed, this was not because the voluptuous <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of stage-plays had taken possession of a warlike people hitherto accustomed only to the games of the circus; but these astute and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits, foreseeing that in due course the pestilence would shortly cease, took occasion to infect, not the bodies, but the morals of their worshippers, with a far more serious disease. And in this pestilence these gods  find great enjoyment, because it benighted the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with so gross a darkness and dishonored them with so foul a deformity, that even quite recently (will posterity be able to credit it?) some of those who fled from the sack of Rome and found refuge in <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, were so infected with this disease, that day after day they seemed to contend with one another who should most madly run after the actors in the theatres.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33.&mdash; That the Overthrow of Rome Has Not Corrected the Vices of the Romans.</h2>

<p>Oh infatuated men, what is this blindness, or rather <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, which possesses you? How is it that while, as we hear, even the eastern nations are bewailing your ruin, and while powerful states in the most remote parts of the earth are mourning your fall as a public calamity, you yourselves should be crowding to the theatres, should be pouring into them and filling them; and, in short, be playing a madder part now than ever before? This was the foul plague-spot, this the wreck of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> that Scipio sought to preserve you from when he prohibited the construction of theatres; this was his reason for desiring that you might still have an enemy to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, seeing as he did how easily prosperity would corrupt and destroy you. He did not consider that republic flourishing whose walls stand, but whose morals are in ruins. But the seductions of evil-minded devils had more influence with you than the precautions of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> men. Hence the injuries you do, you will not permit to be imputed to you: but the injuries you suffer, you impute to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Depraved by good fortune, and not chastened by adversity, what you desire in the restoration of a peaceful and secure state, is not the tranquillity of the commonwealth, but the impunity of your own vicious luxury. Scipio wished you to be hard pressed by an enemy, that you might not abandon yourselves to luxurious manners; but so abandoned are you, that not even when crushed by the enemy is your luxury repressed. You have missed the profit of your calamity; you have been made most wretched, and have remained most profligate.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34.&mdash; Of God's Clemency in Moderating the Ruin of the City.</h2>

<p>And that you are yet alive is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who spares you that you may be admonished to repent and reform your lives. It is He who has permitted you, ungrateful as you are, to escape the sword of the enemy, by calling yourselves His servants, or by finding asylum in the sacred places of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>.</p>

<p>It is said that Romulus and Remus, in order to increase the population of the city they founded, opened a sanctuary in which every man might find asylum and absolution of all crime&mdash;a remarkable foreshadowing of what has recently occurred in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The destroyers of Rome followed the example of its founders. But it was not greatly to their credit that the latter, for the sake of increasing the number of their citizens, did that which the former have done, lest the number of their enemies should be diminished.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35.&mdash; Of the Sons of the Church Who are Hidden Among the Wicked, and of False Christians Within the Church.</h2>

<p>Let these and similar answers (if any fuller and fitter answers can be found) be given to their enemies by the redeemed <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Lord Christ, and by the pilgrim city of King Christ. But let this city bear in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that among her enemies lie hidden those who are destined to be fellow citizens, that she may not think it a fruitless labor to bear what they inflict as enemies until they become confessors of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. So, too, as long as she is a stranger in the world, the city of God has in her communion, and bound to her by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, some who shall not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> dwell in the lot of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Of these, some are not now recognized; others declare themselves, and do not hesitate to make common <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> with our enemies in murmuring against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose sacramental badge they wear. These men you may today see thronging the churches with us, tomorrow crowding the theatres with the godless. But we have the less reason to despair of the reclamation even of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, if among our most declared enemies there are now some, unknown to themselves, who are destined to become our friends. In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, these two cities are entangled together in this world, and intermixed until the last judgment effects their separation. I now proceed to speak, as God shall help me, of the rise, progress, and end of these two cities; and what I write, I write for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that, being placed in comparison with the other, it may shine with a brighter lustre.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36.&mdash; What Subjects are to Be Handled in the Following Discourse.</h2>

<p>But I have still some things to say in confutation of those who refer the disasters of the Roman republic to our religion, because it  prohibits the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to the gods. For this end I must recount all, or as many as may seem sufficient, of the disasters which befell that city and its subject provinces, before these <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were prohibited; for all these disasters they would doubtless have attributed to us, if at that time our religion had shed its light upon them, and had prohibited their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. I must then go on to show what social well-being the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whose hand are all kingdoms, vouchsafed to grant to them that their empire might increase. I must show why He did so, and how their false gods, instead of at all aiding them, greatly injured them by guile and deceit. And, lastly, I must meet those who, when on this point convinced and confuted by irrefragable <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, endeavor to maintain that they worship the gods, not hoping for the present advantages of this life, but for those which are to be enjoyed after death. And this, if I am not mistaken, will be the most difficult part of my task, and will be worthy of the loftiest argument; for we must then enter the lists with the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, not the mere common herd of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, but the most renowned, who in many points agree with ourselves, as regarding the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God created the world, and by His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> rules all He has created. But as they differ from us on other points, we must not shrink from the task of exposing their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, that, having refuted the gainsaying of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> with such ability as God may vouchsafe, we may assert the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to which alone the promise of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and everlasting felicity is attached. Here, then, let us conclude, that we may enter on these subjects in a fresh book.</p>
