<h1>The City of God (Book II)</h1>

<p class="h1a">In this book Augustine reviews those calamities which the Romans suffered before the time of Christ, and while the worship of the false gods was universally practised; and demonstrates that, far from being preserved from misfortune by the gods, the Romans have been by them overwhelmed with the only, or at least the greatest, of all calamities&mdash; the corruption of manners, and the vices of the soul.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; Of the Limits Which Must Be Put to the Necessity of Replying to an Adversary.</h2>

<p>If the feeble mind of man did not presume to resist the clear evidence of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but yielded its infirmity to wholesome doctrines, as to a health-giving medicine, until it obtained from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by its <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> needed to heal it, they who have just ideas, and express them in suitable language, would need to use no long discourse to refute the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of empty conjecture. But this mental infirmity is now more prevalent and hurtful than ever, to such an extent that even after the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has been as fully demonstrated as man can prove it to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, they hold for the very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> their own unreasonable fancies, either on account of their great blindness, which prevents them from seeing what is plainly set before them, or on account of their opinionative obstinacy, which prevents them from acknowledging the force of what they do see. There therefore frequently arises a necessity of speaking more fully on those points which are already clear, that we may, as it were, present them not to the eye, but even to the touch, so that they may be felt even by those who close their eyes against them. And yet to what end shall we ever bring our discussions, or what bounds can be set to our discourse, if we proceed on the principle that we must always reply to those who reply to us? For those who are either unable to understand our arguments, or are so hardened by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of contradiction, that though they understand they cannot yield to them, reply to us, and, as it is written, <q>speak hard things,</q>  and are incorrigibly vain. Now, if we were to propose to confute their objections as often as they with brazen face chose to disregard our arguments, and so often as they could by any means contradict our statements, you see how endless, and fruitless, and painful a task we should be undertaking. And therefore I do not wish my writings to be judged even by you, my son Marcellinus, nor by any of those others at whose service this work of mine is freely and in all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity put, if at least you intend always to require a reply to every exception which you hear taken to what you read in it; for so you would become like those silly <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of whom the apostle says that they are <q>always learning, and never able to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120087"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:7</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; Recapitulation of the Contents of the First Book.</h2>

<p>In the foregoing book, having begun to speak of the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to which I have resolved, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> helping me, to consecrate the whole of this work, it was my first endeavor to reply to those who attribute the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> by which the world is being devastated, and especially the recent sack of Rome by the barbarians, to the religion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which prohibits the offering of abominable <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to devils. I have shown that they ought rather to attribute it to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that for His  name's sake the barbarians, in contravention of all custom and law of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, threw open as sanctuaries the largest churches, and in many instances showed such reverence to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that not only His genuine servants, but even those who in their terror feigned themselves to be so, were exempted from all those hardships which by the custom of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> may lawfully be inflicted. Then out of this there arose the question, why <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and ungrateful men were permitted to share in these benefits; and why, too, the hardships and calamities of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> were inflicted on the godly as well as on the ungodly. And in giving a suitably full answer to this large question, I occupied some considerable space, partly that I might relieve the anxieties which disturb many when they observe that the blessings of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the common and daily <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> casualties, fall to the lot of bad men and good without distinction; but mainly that I might minister some consolation to those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and chaste <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who were outraged by the enemy, in such a way as to shock their modesty, though not to sully their purity, and that I might preserve them from being ashamed of life, though they have no guilt to be ashamed of. And then I briefly spoke against those who with a most shameless wantonness insult over those poor <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who were subjected to those calamities, and especially over those broken-hearted and humiliated, though chaste and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; these fellows themselves being most depraved and unmanly profligates, quite degenerate from the genuine Romans, whose famous <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are abundantly recorded in history, and everywhere celebrated, but who have found in their descendants the greatest enemies of their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, Rome, which was founded and increased by the labors of these ancient heroes, was more shamefully ruined by their descendants, while its walls were still standing, than it is now by the razing of them. For in this ruin there fell stones and timbers; but in the ruin those profligates effected, there fell, not the mural, but the moral bulwarks and ornaments of the city, and their hearts burned with <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> more destructive than the flames which consumed their houses. Thus I brought my first book to a close. And now I go on to speak of those calamities which that city itself, or its subject provinces, have suffered since its foundation; all of which they would equally have attributed to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, if at that early period the doctrine of the gospel against their false and deceiving gods had been as largely and freely proclaimed as now.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; That We Need Only to Read History in Order to See What Calamities the Romans Suffered Before the Religion of Christ Began to Compete with the Worship of the Gods.</h2>

<p>But remember that, in recounting these things, I have still to address myself to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> men; so <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, indeed, as to give birth to the common saying, <q>Drought and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> go hand in hand.</q>  There are indeed some among them who are thoroughly well-<a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> men, and have a taste for history, in which the things I speak of are open to their observation; but in order to irritate the uneducated masses against us, they feign <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of these events, and do what they can to make the vulgar <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that those disasters, which in certain places and at certain times uniformly befall <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, are the result of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, which is being everywhere diffused, and is possessed of a renown and brilliancy which quite eclipse their own gods.  Let them then, along with us, call to mind with what various and repeated disasters the prosperity of Rome was blighted, before ever Christ had come in the flesh, and before His name had been blazoned among the nations with that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which they vainly grudge. Let them, if they can, defend their gods in this article, since they maintain that they worship them in order to be preserved from these disasters, which they now impute to us if they suffer in the least degree. For why did these gods permit the disasters I am to speak of to fall on their worshippers before the preaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> name offended them, and put an end to their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; That the Worshippers of the Gods Never Received from Them Any Healthy Moral Precepts, and that in Celebrating Their Worship All Sorts of Impurities Were Practiced.</h2>

<p>First of all, we would ask why their gods took no steps to improve the morals of their worshippers. That the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God should neglect those who did not seek His help, that was but <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; but why did those gods, from whose worship ungrateful men are now complaining that they are prohibited, issue no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which might have guided their devotees to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life? Surely it was but just, that such care as men showed to the worship  of the gods, the gods on their part should have to the conduct of men. But, it is replied, it is by his own will a man goes astray. Who denies it? But none the less was it incumbent on these gods, who were men's guardians, to publish in plain terms the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of a good life, and not to conceal them from their worshippers. It was their part to send <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to reach and convict such as broke these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and publicly to proclaim the punishments which await evil-doers, and the rewards which may be looked for by those that do well. Did ever the walls of any of their temples echo to any such warning voice? I myself, when I was a young man, used sometimes to go to the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> entertainments and spectacles; I saw the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> raving in religious excitement, and heard the choristers; I took pleasure in the shameful games which were celebrated in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of gods and goddesses, of the virgin C&oelig;lestis,  and Berecynthia,  the mother of all the gods. And on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to her purification, there were sung before her couch productions so obscene and filthy for the ear&mdash; I do not say of the mother of the gods, but of the mother of any senator or honest man&mdash; nay, so impure, that not even the mother of the foul-mouthed players themselves could have formed one of the audience. For natural reverence for <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> is a bond which the most abandoned cannot ignore. And, accordingly, the lewd actions and filthy words with which these players <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> the mother of the gods, in presence of a vast assemblage and audience of both sexes, they could not for very shame have rehearsed at home in presence of their own mothers. And the crowds that were gathered from all quarters by curiosity, offended modesty must, I should suppose, have scattered in the confusion of shame. If these are sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, what is sacrilege? If this is purification, what is pollution? This festivity was called the Tables,  as if a banquet were being given at which unclean devils might find suitable refreshment. For it is not difficult to see what kind of spirits they must be who are delighted with such obscenities, unless, indeed, a man be blinded by these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> passing themselves off under the name of gods, and either disbelieves in their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, or leads such a life as prompts him rather to propitiate and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> them than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; Of the Obscenities Practiced in Honor of the Mother of the Gods.</h2>

<p>In this matter I would prefer to have as my assessors in judgment, not those men who rather take pleasure in these <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> customs than take pains to put an end to them, but that same Scipio Nasica who was chosen by the senate as the citizen most worthy to receive in his hands the image of that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> Cybele, and convey it into the city. He would tell us whether he would be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> to see his own mother so highly esteemed by the state as to have divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> adjudged to her; as the Greeks and Romans and other nations have decreed divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> to men who had been of material service to them, and have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that their mortal benefactors were thus made <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and enrolled among the gods.  Surely he would desire that his mother should enjoy such felicity were it possible. But if we proceeded to ask him whether, among the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> paid to her, he would wish such shameful <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> as these to be celebrated, would he not at once exclaim that he would rather his mother lay stone-dead, than survive as a goddess to lend her ear to these obscenities? Is it possible that he who was of so severe a morality, that he used his influence as a Roman senator to prevent the building of a theatre in that city dedicated to the manly <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, would wish his mother to be propitiated as a goddess with words which would have brought the blush to her cheek when a Roman matron? Could he possibly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the modesty of an estimable <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> would be so transformed by her promotion to divinity, that she would suffer herself to be invoked and celebrated in terms so gross and immodest, that if she had heard the like while alive upon earth, and had listened without stopping her ears and hurrying from the spot, her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>, her husband, and her children would have blushed for her? Therefore, the mother of the gods being such a character as the most profligate man would be ashamed to have for his mother, and meaning to enthral the minds of the Romans, demanded for her service their best citizen, not to ripen him still more in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by her helpful counsel, but to entangle him by her deceit, like her of whom it is written, <q>The adulteress will hunt for the precious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120094"><a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse26">Proverbs&nbsp;6:26</a></span> Her intent was to puff up this high-  souled man by an apparently divine testimony to his excellence, in order that he might rely upon his own eminence in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and make no further efforts after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and religion, without which natural genius, however brilliant, vapors into <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and comes to nothing. For what but a guileful purpose could that goddess demand the best man seeing that in her own sacred festivals she requires such obscenities as the best men would be covered with shame to hear at their own tables?</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; That the Gods of the Pagans Never Inculcated Holiness of Life.</h2>

<p>This is the reason why those divinities quite neglected the lives and morals of the cities and nations who worshipped them, and threw no dreadful prohibition in their way to hinder them from becoming utterly corrupt, and to preserve them from those terrible and detestable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which visit not harvests and vintages, not house and possessions, not the body which is subject to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, the spirit that rules the whole man. If there was any such prohibition, let it be produced, let it be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. They will tell us that purity and probity were inculcated upon those who were initiated in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of religion, and that secret incitements to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> were whispered in the ear of the <em>&eacute;lite</em>; but this is an idle boast. Let them show or name to us the places which were at any time <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to assemblages in which, instead of the obscene songs and licentious acting of players, instead of the celebration of those most filthy and shameless Fugalia  (well called Fugalia, since they banish modesty and right feeling), the people were commanded in the name of the gods to restrain <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, bridle impurity, and conquer ambition; where, in short, they might learn in that school which Persius vehemently lashes them to, when he says: <q>Be taught, you abandoned creatures, and ascertain the causes of things; what we are, and for what end we are born; what is the law of our success in life; and by what art we may turn the goal without making shipwreck; what limit we should put to our <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, what we may lawfully desire, and what uses filthy lucre serves; how much we should bestow upon our country and our <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; learn, in short, what God meant you to be, and what place He has ordered you to fill.</q>  Let them name to us the places where such instructions were wont to be communicated from the gods, and where the people who worshipped them were accustomed to resort to hear them, as we can point to our churches built for this purpose in every land where the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> is received.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; That the Suggestions of Philosophers are Precluded from Having Any Moral Effect, Because They Have Not the Authority Which Belongs to Divine Instruction, and Because Man's Natural Bias to Evil Induces Him Rather to Follow the Examples of the Gods Than to Obey the Precepts of Men.</h2>

<p>But will they perhaps remind us of the schools of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and their disputations? In the first place, these belong not to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but to Greece; and even if we yield to them that they are now Roman, because Greece itself has become a Roman province, still the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are not the commandments of the gods, but the discoveries of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who, at the prompting of their own speculative ability, made efforts to discover the hidden <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature, and the right and wrong in ethics, and in dialectic what was consequent according to the rules of logic, and what was inconsequent and erroneous. And some of them, by God's help, made great discoveries; but when left to themselves they were betrayed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity, and fell into mistakes. And this was ordered by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>, that their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> might be restrained, and that by their example it might be pointed out that it is humility which has access to the highest regions. But of this we shall have more to say, if the Lord God of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> permit, in its own place.  However, if the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have made any discoveries which are sufficient to guide men to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and blessedness, would it not have been greater <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to vote divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> to them? Were it not more accordant with every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> sentiment to read <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> writings in a <q>Temple of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>,</q> than to be present in the temples of devils to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Cybele  mutilating themselves, the effeminate being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, the raving fanatics cutting themselves, and whatever other cruel or shameful, or shamefully cruel or cruelly shameful, ceremony is enjoined by the ritual of such gods as these? Were it not a more  suitable education, and more likely to prompt the youth to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, if they heard public recitals of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the gods, instead of the vain laudation of the customs and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of their ancestors? Certainly all the worshippers of the Roman gods, when once they are possessed by what Persius calls <q>the burning poison of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>,</q>  prefer to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of Jupiter rather than to hear what <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> taught or Cato censured. Hence the young profligate in Terence, when he sees on the wall a fresco representing the fabled descent of Jupiter into the lap of Dana&euml; in the form of a golden shower, accepts this as authoritative precedent for his own licentiousness, and boasts that he is an imitator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>And what God?</q> he says. <q>He who with His thunder shakes the loftiest temples. And was I, a poor creature compared to Him, to make bones of it? No; I did it, and with all my heart.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; That the Theatrical Exhibitions Publishing the Shameful Actions of the Gods, Propitiated Rather Than Offended Them.</h2>

<p>But, some one will interpose, these are the fables of poets, not the deliverances of the gods themselves. Well, I have no mind to arbitrate between the lewdness of theatrical entertainments and of mystic <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>; only this I say, and history bears me out in making the assertion, that those same entertainments, in which the fictions of poets are the main attraction, were not introduced in the festivals of the gods by the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> devotion of the Romans, but that the gods themselves gave the most urgent commands to this effect, and indeed extorted from the Romans these solemnities and celebrations in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. I touched on this in the preceding book, and mentioned that dramatic entertainments were first inaugurated at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on occasion of a pestilence, and by authority of the pontiff. And what man is there who is not more likely to adopt, for the regulation of his own life, the examples that are represented in plays which have a divine sanction, rather than the precepts written and promulgated with no more than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> authority? If the poets gave a false representation of Jove in describing him as adulterous, then it were to be expected that the chaste gods should in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> avenge so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> a fiction, in place of encouraging the games which circulated it. Of these plays, the most inoffensive are comedies and tragedies, that is to say, the dramas which poets write for the stage, and which, though they often handle impure subjects, yet do so without the filthiness of language which characterizes many other performances; and it is these dramas which boys are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> by their seniors to read and learn as a part of what is called a liberal and gentlemanly education. </p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; That the Poetical License Which the Greeks, in Obedience to Their Gods, Allowed, Was Restrained by the Ancient Romans.</h2>

<p>The opinion of the ancient Romans on this matter is attested by Cicero in his work <em>De Republica</em>, in which Scipio, one of the interlocutors, says, <q>The lewdness of comedy could never have been suffered by audiences, unless the customs of society had previously sanctioned the same lewdness.</q> And in the earlier days the Greeks preserved a certain reasonableness in their license, and made it a law, that whatever comedy wished to say of any one, it must say it of him by name. And so in the same work of Cicero's, Scipio says, <q>Whom has it not aspersed? Nay, whom has it not worried? Whom has it spared? Allow that it may assail demagogues and factions, men injurious to the commonwealth&mdash; a Cleon, a Cleophon, a Hyperbolus. That is tolerable, though it had been more seemly for the public censor to brand such men, than for a poet to lampoon them; but to blacken the fame of Pericles with scurrilous verse, after he had with the utmost dignity presided over their state alike in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and in peace, was as unworthy of a poet, as if our own Plautus or N&aelig;vius were to bring Publius and Cneius Scipio on the comic stage, or as if C&aelig;cilius were to caricature Cato.</q> And then a little after he goes on: <q>Though our Twelve Tables attached the penalty of death only to a very few offenses, yet among these few this was one: if any man should have sung a pasquinade, or have composed a satire calculated to bring <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> or disgrace on another person. Wisely decreed. For it is by the decisions of magistrates, and by a well-informed <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that our lives ought to be judged, and not by the flighty fancies of poets; neither ought we to be exposed to hear <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>, save where we have the liberty of replying, and defending ourselves before an adequate tribunal.</q> This much I have judged it advisable to quote from  the fourth book of Cicero's <em>De Republica</em>; and I have made the quotation word for word, with the exception of some words omitted, and some slightly transposed, for the sake of giving the sense more readily. And certainly the extract is pertinent to the matter I am endeavoring to explain. Cicero makes some further remarks, and concludes the passage by showing that the ancient Romans did not permit any living man to be either praised or blamed on the stage. But the Greeks, as I said, though not so moral, were more <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> in allowing this license which the Romans forbade; for they saw that their gods approved and enjoyed the scurrilous language of low comedy when directed not only against men, but even against themselves; and this, whether the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> actions imputed to them were the fictions of poets, or were their actual iniquities commemorated and acted in the theatres. And would that the spectators had judged them worthy only of laughter, and not of imitation! Manifestly it had been a stretch of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to spare the good name of the leading men and the common citizens, when the very deities did not grudge that their own <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> should be blemished.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; That the Devils, in Suffering Either False or True Crimes to Be Laid to Their Charge, Meant to Do Men a Mischief.</h2>

<p>It is alleged, in excuse of this practice, that the stories told of the gods are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but false, and mere inventions, but this only makes matters worse, if we form our estimate by the morality our religion teaches; and if we consider the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the devils, what more wily and astute artifice could they practise upon men? When a <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> is uttered against a leading statesman of upright and useful life, is it not reprehensible in proportion to its untruth and groundlessness? What punishment, then, shall be sufficient when the gods are the objects of so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and outrageous an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>? But the devils, whom these men repute gods, are content that even iniquities they are guiltless of should be ascribed to them, so long as they may entangle men's minds in the meshes of these opinions, and draw them on along with themselves to their <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> punishment: whether such things were actually committed by the men whom these devils, delighting in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infatuation, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be worshipped as gods, and in whose stead they, by a thousand malign and deceitful artifices, substitute themselves, and so receive worship; or whether, though they were really the crimes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits gladly allowed them to be attributed to higher beings, that there might seem to be conveyed from heaven itself a sufficient sanction for the perpetration of shameful <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. The Greeks, therefore, seeing the character of the gods they served, thought that the poets should certainly not refrain from showing up <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> on the stage, either because they desired to be like their gods in this, or because they were afraid that, if they required for themselves a more unblemished <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> than they asserted for the gods, they might provoke them to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; That the Greeks Admitted Players to Offices of State, on the Ground that Men Who Pleased the Gods Should Not Be Contemptuously Treated by Their Fellows.</h2>

<p>It was a part of this same reasonableness of the Greeks which induced them to bestow upon the actors of these same plays no inconsiderable civic <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>. In the above-mentioned book of the <em>De Republica</em>, it is mentioned that Aeschines, a very eloquent Athenian, who had been a tragic actor in his youth, became a statesman, and that the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> again and again sent another tragedian, Aristodemus, as their plenipotentiary to Philip. For they judged it unbecoming to condemn and treat as <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> those who were the chief actors in the scenic entertainments which they saw to be so pleasing to the gods. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> this was immoral of the Greeks, but there can be as little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> they acted in conformity with the character of their gods; for how could they have presumed to protect the conduct of the citizens from being cut to pieces by the tongues of poets and players, who were allowed, and even enjoined by the gods, to tear their divine <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> to tatters? And how could they hold in contempt the men who acted in the theatres those dramas which, as they had ascertained, gave pleasure to the gods whom they worshipped? Nay, how could they but grant to them the highest civic <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>? On what plea could they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who offered for them acceptable <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to the gods, if they branded with <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> the actors who in behalf of the people gave to the gods that pleasure or <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which they demanded, and which, according to the account of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, they were <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> at not receiving. Labeo,  whose learning makes him an authority on such points, is of opinion that  the distinction between good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deities should find expression in a difference of worship; that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should be propitiated by bloody <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and doleful <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, but the good with a joyful and pleasant observance, as, <em>e.g</em>. (as he says himself), with plays, festivals, and banquets.  All this we shall, with God's help, hereafter discuss. At present, and speaking to the subject on hand, whether all kinds of offerings are made indiscriminately to all the gods, as if all were good (and it is an unseemly thing to conceive that there are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> gods; but these gods of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> are all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because they are not gods, but <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>), or whether, as Labeo thinks, a distinction is made between the offerings presented to the different gods the Greeks are equally justified in honoring alike the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> by whom the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are offered, and the players by whom the dramas are acted, that they may not be open to the charge of doing an injury to all their gods, if the plays are pleasing to all of them, or (which were still worse) to their good gods, if the plays are relished only by them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; That the Romans, by Refusing to the Poets the Same License in Respect of Men Which They Allowed Them in the Case of the Gods, Showed a More Delicate Sensitiveness Regarding Themselves than Regarding the Gods.</h2>

<p>The Romans, however, as Scipio boasts in that same discussion, declined having their conduct and good name subjected to the assaults and <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> of the poets, and went so far as to make it a capital crime if any one should dare to compose such verses. This was a very <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> course to pursue, so far as they themselves were concerned, but in respect of the gods it was <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and irreligious: for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the gods not only tolerated, but relished, being lashed by the injurious expressions of the poets, and yet they themselves would not suffer this same handling; and what their ritual prescribed as acceptable to the gods, their law prohibited as injurious to themselves. How then, Scipio, do you praise the Romans for refusing this license to the poets, so that no citizen could be <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a>, while you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the gods were not included under this protection? Do you count your senate-house worthy of so much higher a regard than the Capitol? Is the one city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> more valuable in your eyes than the whole heaven of gods, that you prohibit your poets from uttering any injurious words against a citizen, though they may with impunity cast what imputations they please upon the gods, without the interference of senator, censor, prince, or pontiff? It was, forsooth, intolerable that Plautus or N&aelig;vus should attack Publius and Cneius Scipio, insufferable that C&aelig;cilius should lampoon Cato; but quite proper that your Terence should encourage youthful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> example of supreme Jove.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; That the Romans Should Have Understood that Gods Who Desired to Be Worshipped in Licentious Entertainments Were Unworthy of Divine Honor.</h2>

<p>But Scipio, were he alive, would possibly reply: <q>How could we attach a penalty to that which the gods themselves have <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>? For the theatrical entertainments in which such things are said, and acted, and performed, were introduced into Roman society by the gods, who ordered that they should be dedicated and exhibited in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.</q> But was not this, then, the plainest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that they were no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> gods, nor in any respect worthy of receiving divine honours from the republic? Suppose they had required that in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the citizens of Rome should be held up to ridicule, every Roman would have resented the hateful proposal. How then, I would ask, can they be esteemed worthy of worship, when they propose that their own crimes be used as material for celebrating their praises? Does not this artifice expose them, and prove that they are detestable devils? Thus the Romans, though they were superstitious enough to serve as gods those who made no secret of their desire to be worshipped in licentious plays, yet had sufficient regard to their hereditary dignity and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to prompt them to refuse to players any such rewards as the Greeks accorded them. On this point we have this testimony of Scipio, recorded in Cicero: <q>They [the Romans] considered comedy and all theatrical performances as disgraceful, and therefore not only debarred players from offices and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> open to ordinary citizens, but also decreed that their names should be branded by the censor, and erased from the roll of their tribe.</q> An excellent decree, and another testimony to the sagacity of Rome; but I could wish their <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> had been more thorough-going and consistent. For when I hear that if any Roman citizen chose the stage as his profession, he not only closed to himself every laudable career, but even became an outcast from his own tribe, I cannot but exclaim: This is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Roman spirit, this is worthy of a state  jealous of its <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>. But then some one interrupts my rapture, by inquiring with what consistency players are debarred from all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, while plays are counted among the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> due to the gods? For a long while the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of Rome was uncontaminated by theatrical exhibitions;  and if they had been adopted for the sake of gratifying the taste of the citizens, they would have been introduced hand in hand with the relaxation of manners. But the fact is, that it was the gods who demanded that they should be exhibited to gratify them. With what <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, then, is the player <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by whom God is worshipped? On what pretext can you at once adore him who exacts, and brand him who acts these plays? This, then, is the controversy in which the Greeks and Romans are engaged. The Greeks think they <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> players, because they worship the gods who demand plays; the Romans, on the other hand, do not suffer an actor to disgrace by his name his own plebeian tribe, far less the senatorial order. And the whole of this discussion may be summed up in the following syllogism. The Greeks give us the major premise: If such gods are to be worshipped, then certainly such men may be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>. The Romans add the minor: But such men must by no means be honoured. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> draw the conclusion: Therefore such gods must by no means be worshipped.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; That Plato, Who Excluded Poets from a Well-Ordered City, Was Better Than These Gods Who Desire to Be Honoured by Theatrical Plays.</h2>

<p>We have still to inquire why the poets who write the plays, and who by the law of the twelve tables are prohibited from injuring the good name of the citizens, are reckoned more estimable than the actors, though they so shamefully asperse the character of the gods? Is it right that the actors of these poetical and God-dishonoring effusions be branded, while their authors are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>? Must we not here award the palm to a Greek, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who, in framing his ideal republic,  conceived that poets should be banished from the city as enemies of the state? He could not brook that the gods be brought into disrepute, nor that the minds of the citizens be depraved and besotted, by the fictions of the poets. Compare now <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as you see it in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, expelling poets from the city that the citizens be uninjured, with the divine nature as you see it in these gods exacting plays in their own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> strove, though unsuccessfully, to persuade the light-minded and lascivious Greeks to abstain from so much as writing such plays; the gods used their authority to extort the acting of the same from the dignified and sober-minded Romans. And not content with having them acted, they had them dedicated to themselves, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to themselves, solemnly celebrated in their own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. To which, then, would it be more becoming in a state to decree divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>&mdash;to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who prohibited these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and licentious plays, or to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who delighted in blinding men to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of what <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> unsuccessfully sought to inculcate?</p>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, has been elevated by Labeo to the rank of a demigod, and set thus upon a level with such as Hercules and Romulus. Labeo ranks demigods higher than heroes, but both he counts among the deities. But I have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he thinks this man whom he reckons a demigod worthy of greater respect not only than the heroes, but also than the gods themselves. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Romans and the speculations of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> have this resemblance, that the latter pronounce a wholesale condemnation of poetical fictions, while the former restrain the license of satire, at least so far as men are the objects of it. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> will not suffer poets even to dwell in his city: the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Rome prohibit actors from being enrolled as citizens; and if they had not feared to offend the gods who had asked the services of the players, they would in all likelihood have banished them altogether. It is obvious, therefore, that the Romans could not receive, nor reasonably expect to receive, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for the regulation of their conduct from their gods, since the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> they themselves enacted far surpassed and put to shame the morality of the gods. The gods demand stageplays in their own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; the Romans exclude the players from all civic <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>;  the former commanded that they should be celebrated by the scenic representation of their own disgrace; the latter commanded that no poet should dare to blemish the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of any citizen. But that demigod <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> resisted the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of such gods as these, and showed the Romans what their genius had left incomplete; for he absolutely excluded poets from his ideal state, whether they composed fictions with no regard to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or set the worst possible examples before wretched men under the guise of divine actions. We for our part, indeed, reckon <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> neither a god nor a  demigod; we would not even compare him to any of God's <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; nor to the truth-speaking <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, nor to any of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> or <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nay, not to any faithful <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man. The reason of this opinion of ours we will, God prospering us, render in its own place. Nevertheless, since they wish him to be considered a demigod, we think he certainly is more entitled to that rank, and is every way superior, if not to Hercules and Romulus (though no historian could ever narrate nor any poet sing of him that he had killed his brother, or committed any crime), yet certainly to Priapus, or a Cynocephalus,  or the Fever, &mdash; divinities whom the Romans have partly received from foreigners, and partly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by home-grown <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. How, then, could gods such as these be expected to promulgate good and wholesome <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, either for the prevention of moral and social <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, or for their eradication where they had already sprung up?&mdash; gods who used their influence even to sow and cherish profligacy, by appointing that <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to them should be published to the people by means of theatrical exhibitions, and by thus gratuitously fanning the flame of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> with the breath of a seemingly divine approbation. In vain does Cicero, speaking of poets, exclaim against this state of things in these words: <q>When the plaudits and acclamation of the people, who sit as infallible judges, are won by the poets, what darkness benights the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, what fears invade, what <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> inflame it!</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; That It Was Vanity, Not Reason, Which Created Some of the Roman Gods.</h2>

<p>But is it not manifest that vanity rather than reason regulated the choice of some of their false gods? This <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, whom they reckon a demigod, and who used all his eloquence to preserve men from the most dangerous spiritual calamities, has yet not been counted worthy even of a little shrine; but Romulus, because they can call him their own, they have esteemed more highly than many gods, though their secret doctrine can allow him the rank only of a demigod. To him they allotted a flamen, that is to say, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of a class so highly esteemed in their religion (distinguished, too, by their conical mitres), that for only three of their gods were flamens appointed&mdash;the Flamen Dialis for Jupiter, Martialis for Mars, and Quirinalis for Romulus (for when the ardor of his fellow citizens had given Romulus a seat among the gods, they gave him this new name Quirinus). And thus by this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> Romulus has been preferred to Neptune and Pluto, Jupiter's brothers, and to Saturn himself, their father. They have assigned the same <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> to serve him as to serve Jove; and in giving Mars (the reputed father of Romulus) the same <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, is this not rather for Romulus' sake than to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> Mars?</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; That If the Gods Had Really Possessed Any Regard for Righteousness, the Romans Should Have Received Good Laws from Them, Instead of Having to Borrow Them from Other Nations.</h2>

<p>Moreover, if the Romans had been able to receive a rule of life from their gods, they would not have borrowed Solon's <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> from the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>, as they did some years after Rome was founded; and yet they did not keep them as they received them, but endeavored to improve and amend them.  Although Lycurgus pretended that he was authorized by Apollo to give <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to the Lacedemonians, the sensible Romans did not choose to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this, and were not induced to borrow <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> from Sparta. Numa Pompilius, who succeeded Romulus in the kingdom, is said to have framed some <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, which, however, were not sufficient for the regulation of civic affairs. Among these regulations were many pertaining to religious observances, and yet he is not reported to have received even these from the gods. With respect, then, to moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of life and conduct&mdash;<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which are so mighty, that, according to the wisest <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>,  by them states are ruined while their cities stand uninjured,&mdash; their gods made not the smallest provision for preserving their worshippers from these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, but, on the contrary, took special pains to increase them, as we have previously endeavored to prove.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.&mdash; Of the Rape of the Sabine Women, and Other Iniquities Perpetrated in Rome's Palmiest Days.</h2>

<p>But possibly we are to find the reason for this neglect of the Romans by their gods, in the saying of Sallust, that <q>equity and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> prevailed among the Romans not more by  force of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> than of nature.</q>  I presume it is to this inborn equity and goodness of disposition we are to ascribe the rape of the Sabine <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. What, indeed, could be more equitable and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, than to carry off by force, as each man was fit, and without their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> consent, girls who were strangers and guests, and who had been decoyed and entrapped by the pretence of a spectacle! If the Sabines were wrong to deny their daughters when the Romans asked for them, was it not a greater wrong in the Romans to carry them off after that denial? The Romans might more <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> have waged <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the neighboring nation for having refused their daughters in marriage when they first sought them, than for having demanded them back when they had stolen them. War should have been proclaimed at first; it was then that Mars should have helped his warlike son, that he might by force of arms avenge the injury done him by the refusal of marriage, and might also thus win the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> he desired. There might have been some appearance of <q>right of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a></q> in a victor carrying off, in virtue of this right, the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who had been without any show of right denied him; whereas there was no <q>right of peace</q> entitling him to carry off those who were not given to him, and to wage an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with their <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> enraged <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. One <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> circumstance was indeed connected with this act of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, viz., that though it was commemorated by the games of the circus, yet even this did not constitute it a precedent in the city or realm of Rome. If one would find fault with the results of this act, it must rather be on the ground that the Romans made Romulus a god in spite of his perpetrating this iniquity; for one cannot reproach them with making this deed any kind of precedent for the rape of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.</p>

<p>Again, I presume it was due to this natural equity and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that after the expulsion of King Tarquin, whose son had violated Lucretia, Junius Brutus the consul forced Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, Lucretia's husband and his own colleague, a good and innocent man, to resign his office and go into banishment, on the one sole charge that he was of the name and blood of the Tarquins. This <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> was perpetrated with the approval, or at least connivance, of the people, who had themselves raised to the consular office both Collatinus and Brutus. Another instance of this equity and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is found in their treatment of Marcus Camillus. This eminent man, after he had rapidly conquered the Veians, at that time the most formidable of Rome's enemies, and who had maintained a ten years' <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, in which the Roman army had suffered the usual calamities attendant on bad generalship, after he had restored security to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which had begun to tremble for its safety, and after he had taken the wealthiest city of the enemy, had charges brought against him by the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of those that envied his success, and by the insolence of the tribunes of the people; and seeing that the city bore him no gratitude for preserving it, and that he would certainly be condemned, he went into exile, and even in his absence was fined 10,000 asses. Shortly after, however, his ungrateful country had again to seek his protection from the Gauls. But I cannot now mention all the shameful and iniquitous acts with which Rome was agitated, when the aristocracy attempted to subject the people, and the people resented their encroachments, and the advocates of either party were actuated rather by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of victory than by any equitable or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> consideration.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; What the History of Sallust Reveals Regarding the Life of the Romans, Either When Straitened by Anxiety or Relaxed in Security.</h2>

<p>I will therefore pause, and adduce the testimony of Sallust himself, whose words in praise of the Romans (that <q>equity and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> prevailed among them not more by force of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> than of nature</q>) have given occasion to this discussion. He was referring to that period immediately after the expulsion of the kings, in which the city became great in an incredibly short space of time. And yet this same writer acknowledges in the first book of his history, in the very exordium of his work, that even at that time, when a very brief interval had elapsed after the government had passed from kings to consuls, the more powerful men began to act <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, and occasioned the defection of the people from the patricians, and other disorders in the city. For after Sallust had stated that the Romans enjoyed greater harmony and a purer state of society between the second and third Punic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> than at any other time, and that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this was not their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of good order, but their <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest the peace they had with <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> might be broken (this also, as we mentioned, Nasica contemplated when he opposed the destruction of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, for he supposed that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> would tend to repress <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and to preserve wholesome ways of living), he then goes on to say: <q>Yet, after the destruction of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, discord, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, am  bition, and the other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> which are commonly generated by prosperity, more than ever increased.</q> If they <q>increased,</q> and that <q>more than ever,</q> then already they had appeared, and had been increasing. And so Sallust adds this reason for what he said. <q>For,</q> he says, <q>the oppressive measures of the powerful, and the consequent secessions of the plebs from the patricians, and other civil dissensions, had <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> from the first, and affairs were administered with equity and well-tempered <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> for no longer a period than the short time after the expulsion of the kings, while the city was occupied with the serious Tuscan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and Tarquin's vengeance.</q> You see how, even in that brief period after the expulsion of the kings, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, he acknowledges, was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the interval of equity and good order. They were afraid, in fact, of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which Tarquin waged against them, after he had been driven from the throne and the city, and had allied himself with the Tuscans. But observe what he adds: <q>After that, the patricians treated the people as their slaves, ordering them to be scourged or beheaded just as the kings had done, driving them from their holdings, and harshly tyrannizing over those who had no property to lose. The people, overwhelmed by these oppressive measures, and most of all by exorbitant <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to contribute both money and personal service to the constant <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, at length took arms and seceded to Mount Aventine and Mount Sacer, and thus obtained for themselves tribunes and protective <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. But it was only the second Punic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that put an end on both sides to discord and strife.</q> You see what kind of men the Romans were, even so early as a few years after the expulsion of the kings; and it is of these men he says, that <q>equity and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> prevailed among them not more by force of law than of nature.</q></p>

<p>Now, if these were the days in which the Roman republic shows fairest and best, what are we to say or think of the succeeding age, when, to use the words of the same historian, <q>changing little by little from the fair and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> city it was, it became utterly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and dissolute?</q> This was, as he mentions, after the destruction of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>. Sallust's brief sum and sketch of this period may be read in his own history, in which he shows how the profligate manners which were propagated by prosperity resulted at last even in civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. He says: <q>And from this time the primitive manners, instead of undergoing an insensible alteration as hitherto they had done, were swept away as by a torrent: the young men were so depraved by luxury and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, that it may <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> be said that no father had a son who could either preserve his own patrimony, or keep his hands off other men's.</q> Sallust adds a number of particulars about the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of Sylla, and the debased condition of the republic in general; and other writers make similar observations, though in much less striking language.</p>

<p>However, I suppose you now see, or at least any one who gives his attention has the means of seeing, in what a sink of iniquity that city was plunged before the advent of our heavenly King. For these things happened not only before Christ had begun to teach, but before He was even born of the Virgin. If, then, they dare not impute to their gods the grievous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of those former times, more tolerable before the destruction of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, but intolerable and dreadful after it, although it was the gods who by their malign craft instilled into the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the conceptions from which such dreadful <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> branched out on all sides, why do they impute these present calamities to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who teaches life-giving <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and forbids us to worship false and deceitful gods, and who, abominating and condemning with His divine authority those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and hurtful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, gradually withdraws His own people from a world that is corrupted by these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and is falling into ruins, to make of them an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> city, whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> rests not on the acclamations of vanity, but on the judgment of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; Of the Corruption Which Had Grown Upon the Roman Republic Before Christ Abolished the Worship of the Gods.</h2>

<p>Here, then, is this Roman republic, <q>which has changed little by little from the fair and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> city it was, and has become utterly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and dissolute.</q> It is not I who am the first to say this, but their own authors, from whom we learned it for a fee, and who wrote it long before the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. You see how, before the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and after the destruction of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, <q>the primitive manners, instead of undergoing insensible alteration, as hitherto they had done, were swept away as by a torrent; and how depraved by luxury and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> the youth were.</q> Let them now, on their part, read to us any <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> given by their gods to the Roman people, and directed against luxury and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>. And would that they had only been silent on the subjects of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and modesty, and had not demanded from the people indecent and shameful practices, to which they lent a pernicious patronage by their so-called divinity. Let them read our commandments  in the Prophets, <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, Acts of the Apostles or Epistles; let them peruse the large number of precepts against <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and luxury which are everywhere read to the congregations that meet for this purpose, and which strike the ear, not with the uncertain sound of a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> discussion, but with the thunder of God's own oracle pealing from the clouds. And yet they do not impute to their gods the luxury and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, the cruel and dissolute manners, that had rendered the republic utterly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and corrupt, even before the coming of Christ; but whatever affliction their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and effeminacy have exposed them to in these latter days, they furiously impute to our religion. If the kings of the earth and all their subjects, if all princes and judges of the earth, if young men and maidens, old and young, every age, and both sexes; if they whom the Baptist addressed, the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and the soldiers, were all together to hearken to and observe the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> regarding a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life, then should the republic adorn the whole earth with its own felicity, and attain in life everlasting to the pinnacle of kingly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But because this man listens and that man scoffs, and most are enamored of the blandishments of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> rather than the wholesome severity of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the people of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whatever be their condition&mdash; whether they be kings, princes, judges, soldiers, or provincials, rich or poor, bond or free, male or female&mdash; are enjoined to endure this earthly republic, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and dissolute as it is, that so they may by this endurance win for themselves an eminent place in that most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and august assembly of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and republic of heaven, in which the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the law.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; Of the Kind of Happiness and Life Truly Delighted in by Those Who Inveigh Against the Christian Religion.</h2>

<p>But the worshippers and admirers of these gods delight in imitating their scandalous iniquities, and are nowise concerned that the republic be less depraved and licentious. Only let it remain undefeated, they say, only let it flourish and abound in resources; let it be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> by its victories, or still better, secure in peace; and what matters it to us? This is our concern, that every man be able to increase his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> so as to supply his daily prodigalities, and so that the powerful may subject the weak for their own purposes. Let the poor court the rich for a living, and that under their protection they may enjoy a sluggish tranquillity; and let the rich abuse the poor as their dependants, to minister to their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Let the people applaud not those who protect their interests, but those who provide them with pleasure. Let no severe duty be commanded, no impurity forbidden. Let kings estimate their prosperity, not by the righteousness, but by the servility of their subjects. Let the provinces stand loyal to the kings, not as moral guides, but as lords of their possessions and purveyors of their pleasures; not with a hearty reverence, but a crooked and servile <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Let the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> take cognizance rather of the injury done to another man's property, than of that done to one's own person. If a man be a nuisance to his neighbor, or injure his property, <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, or person, let him be actionable; but in his own affairs let everyone with impunity do what he will in company with his own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and with those who willingly join him. Let there be a plentiful supply of public prostitutes for every one who wishes to use them, but specially for those who are too poor to keep one for their private use. Let there be erected houses of the largest and most ornate description: in these let there be provided the most sumptuous banquets, where every one who pleases may, by day or night, play, drink, vomit,  dissipate. Let there be everywhere heard the rustling of dancers, the loud, immodest laughter of the theatre; let a succession of the most cruel and the most voluptuous pleasures maintain a perpetual excitement. If such <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is distasteful to any, let him be branded as a public enemy; and if any attempt to modify or put an end to it let him be silenced, banished, put an end to. Let these be reckoned the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> gods, who procure for the people this condition of things, and preserve it when once possessed. Let them be worshipped as they wish; let them demand whatever games they please, from or with their own worshippers; only let them secure that such felicity be not imperilled by foe, plague, or disaster of any kind. What sane man would compare a republic such as this, I will not say to the Roman empire, but to the palace of Sardanapalus, the ancient king who was so abandoned to pleasures, that he caused it to be inscribed on his tomb, that now that he was dead, he possessed only those things which he had swallowed and consumed by his appetites while alive? If these men had such a king as this, who, while self-indulgent, should lay no severe restraint on them, they would more enthusiastically consecrate to him a temple and a flamen than the ancient Romans did to Romulus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.&mdash; Cicero's Opinion of the Roman Republic.</h2>

<p>But if our adversaries do not care how foully and disgracefully the Roman republic be stained by corrupt practices, so long only as it holds together and continues in being, and if they therefore pooh-pooh the testimony of Sallust to its <q>utterly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and profligate</q> condition, what will they make of Cicero's statement, that even in his time it had become entirely extinct, and that there remained extant no Roman republic at all? He introduces Scipio (the Scipio who had destroyed <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>) discussing the republic, at a time when already there were presentiments of its speedy ruin by that corruption which Sallust describes. In fact, at the time when the discussion took place, one of the Gracchi, who, according to Sallust, was the first great instigator of seditions, had already been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. His death, indeed, is mentioned in the same book. Now Scipio, at the end of the second book, says: <q>As among the different sounds which proceed from lyres, flutes, and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> voice, there must be maintained a certain harmony which a cultivated ear cannot endure to hear disturbed or jarring, but which may be elicited in full and absolute concord by the modulation even of voices very unlike one another; so, where reason is allowed to modulate the diverse elements of the state, there is obtained a perfect concord from the upper, lower, and middle classes as from various sounds; and what musicians call harmony in singing, is concord in matters of state, which is the strictest bond and best security of any republic, and which by no ingenuity can be retained where <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has become extinct.</q> Then, when he had expatiated somewhat more fully, and had more copiously illustrated the benefits of its presence and the ruinous effects of its absence upon a state, Pilus, one of the company present at the discussion, struck in and demanded that the question should be more thoroughly sifted, and that the subject of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> should be freely discussed for the sake of ascertaining what <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> there was in the maxim which was then becoming daily more current, that <q>the republic cannot be governed without <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.</q> Scipio expressed his willingness to have this maxim discussed and sifted, and gave it as his opinion that it was baseless, and that no progress could be made in discussing the republic unless it was established, not only that this maxim, that <q>the republic cannot be governed without <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>,</q> was false, but also that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, that it cannot be governed without the most absolute <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. And the discussion of this question, being deferred till the next day, is carried on in the third book with great animation. For Pilus himself undertook to defend the position that the republic cannot be governed without <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, at the same time being at special pains to clear himself of any real participation in that opinion. He advocated with great keenness the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> against <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and endeavored by plausible reasons and examples to demonstrate that the former is beneficial, the latter useless, to the republic. Then, at the request of the company, L&aelig;lius attempted to defend <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and strained every nerve to prove that nothing is so hurtful to a state as <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>; and that without <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> a republic can neither be governed, nor even continue to exist.</p>

<p>When this question has been handled to the satisfaction of the company, Scipio reverts to the original thread of discourse, and repeats with commendation his own brief definition of a republic, that it is the good of the people. <q>The people</q> he defines as being not every assemblage or mob, but an assemblage associated by a common acknowledgment of law, and by a community of interests. Then he shows the use of definition in debate; and from these definitions of his own he gathers that a republic, or <q>good of the people,</q> then exists only when it is well and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> governed, whether by a monarch, or an aristocracy, or by the whole people. But when the monarch is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, or, as the Greeks say, a tyrant; or the aristocrats are <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, and form a faction; or the people themselves are <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, and become, as Scipio for want of a better name calls them, themselves the tyrant, then the republic is not only blemished (as had been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the day before), but by legitimate deduction from those definitions, it altogether ceases to be. For it could not be the people's good when a tyrant factiously lorded it over the state; neither would the people be any longer a people if it were <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, since it would no longer answer the definition of a people&mdash; <q>an assemblage associated by a common acknowledgment of law, and by a community of interests.</q></p>

<p>When, therefore, the Roman republic was such as Sallust described it, it was not <q>utterly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and profligate,</q> as he says, but had altogether ceased to exist, if we are to admit the reasoning of that debate maintained on the subject of the republic by its best representatives. Tully himself, too, speaking not in the person of Scipio or any one else, but uttering his own sentiments, uses the following language in the beginning of the fifth book, after quoting a line from the poet Ennius, in which he said, <q>Rome's severe  morality and her citizens are her safeguard.</q> <q>This verse,</q> says Cicero, <q>seems to me to have all the sententious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfulness</a> of an oracle. For neither would the citizens have availed without the morality of the community, nor would the morality of the commons without outstanding men have availed either to establish or so long to maintain in vigor so grand a republic with so wide and just an empire. Accordingly, before our day, the hereditary usages formed our foremost men, and they on their part retained the usages and institutions of their fathers. But our age, receiving the republic as a <em>chef-d'oeuvre</em> of another age which has already begun to grow old, has not merely neglected to restore the colors of the original, but has not even been at the pains to preserve so much as the general outline and most outstanding features. For what survives of that primitive morality which the poet called Rome's safeguard? It is so obsolete and forgotten, that, far from practising it, one does not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it. And of the citizens what shall I say? Morality has perished through poverty of great men; a poverty for which we must not only assign a reason, but for the guilt of which we must answer as criminals charged with a capital crime. For it is through our <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and not by any mishap, that we retain only the name of a republic, and have long since lost the reality.</q></p>

<p>This is the confession of Cicero, long indeed after the death of <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Africanus</a>, whom he introduced as an interlocutor in his work <em>De Republica</em>, but still before the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Yet, if the disasters he bewails had been lamented after the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> had been diffused, and had begun to prevail, is there a man of our adversaries who would not have thought that they were to be imputed to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? Why, then, did their gods not take steps then to prevent the decay and extinction of that republic, over the loss of which Cicero, long before Christ had come in the flesh, sings so lugubrious a dirge? Its admirers have need to inquire whether, even in the days of primitive men and morals, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> flourished in it; or was it not perhaps even then, to use the casual expression of Cicero, rather a colored painting than the living reality? But, if God will, we shall consider this elsewhere. For I mean in its own place to show that&mdash; according to the definitions in which Cicero himself, using Scipio as his mouthpiece, briefly propounded what a republic is, and what a people is, and according to many testimonies, both of his own lips and of those who took part in that same debate&mdash; Rome never was a republic, because <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> had never a place in it. But accepting the more feasible definitions of a republic, I grant there was a republic of a certain kind, and certainly much better administered by the more ancient Romans than by their modern representatives. But the fact is, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> save in that republic whose founder and ruler is Christ, if at least any choose to call this a republic; and indeed we cannot deny that it is the people's good. But if perchance this name, which has become familiar in other connections, be considered alien to our common parlance, we may at all events say that in this city is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; the city of which <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> says, <q>Glorious things are said of you, O city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; That the Roman Gods Never Took Any Steps to Prevent the Republic from Being Ruined by Immorality.</h2>

<p>But what is relevant to the present question is this, that however admirable our adversaries say the republic was or is, it is certain that by the testimony of their own most learned writers it had become, long before the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, utterly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and dissolute, and indeed had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but had been destroyed by profligacy. To prevent this, surely these guardian gods ought to have given precepts of morals and a rule of life to the people by whom they were worshipped in so many temples, with so great a variety of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, with such numberless and diverse <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, so many festal solemnities, so many celebrations of magnificent games. But in all this the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> only looked after their own interest, and cared not at all how their worshippers lived, or rather were at pains to induce them to lead an abandoned life, so long as they paid these tributes to their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and regarded them with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. If any one denies this, let him produce, let him point to, let him read the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which the gods had given against sedition, and which the Gracchi transgressed when they threw everything into confusion; or those Marius, and Cinna, and Carbo broke when they involved their country in civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, most iniquitous and unjustifiable in their causes, cruelly conducted, and yet more cruelly terminated; or those which Sylla scorned, whose life, character, and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, as described by Sallust and other historians, are the abhorrence of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. Who will deny that at that time the republic had become extinct?</p>

<p>Possibly they will be bold enough to suggest in defence of the gods, that they abandoned the city on account of the profligacy  of the citizens, according to the lines of Virgil:</p>

<blockquote><p>Gone from each fane, each sacred shrine,<br>
Are those who made this realm divine. </p></blockquote>

<p>But, firstly, if it be so, then they cannot complain against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, as if it were that which gave offense to the gods and caused them to abandon Rome, since the Roman immorality had long ago driven from the altars of the city a cloud of little gods, like as many flies. And yet where was this host of divinities, when, long before the corruption of the primitive morality, Rome was taken and burnt by the Gauls? Perhaps they were present, but asleep? For at that time the whole city fell into the hands of the enemy, with the single exception of the Capitoline hill; and this too would have been taken, had not&mdash; the watchful geese aroused the sleeping gods! And this gave occasion to the festival of the goose, in which Rome sank nearly to the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> of the Egyptians, who worship beasts and birds. But of these adventitious <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which are inflicted by hostile armies or by some disaster, and which attach rather to the body than the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, I am not meanwhile disputing. At present I speak of the decay of morality, which at first almost imperceptibly lost its brilliant hue, but afterwards was wholly obliterated, was swept away as by a torrent, and involved the republic in such disastrous ruin, that though the houses and walls remained standing the leading writers do not scruple to say that the republic was destroyed. Now, the departure of the gods <q>from each fane, each sacred shrine,</q> and their abandonment of the city to destruction, was an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, if their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> inculcating <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and a moral life had been held in contempt by that city. But what kind of gods were these, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, who declined to live with a people who worshipped them, and whose corrupt life they had done nothing to reform?</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.&mdash; That the Vicissitudes of This Life are Dependent Not on the Favor or Hostility of Demons, But on the Will of the True God.</h2>

<p>But, further, is it not obvious that the gods have abetted the fulfilment of men's desires, instead of authoritatively bridling them? For Marius, a low-born and self-made man, who ruthlessly provoked and conducted civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, was so effectually aided by them, that he was seven times consul, and died full of years in his seventh consulship, escaping the hands of Sylla, who immediately afterwards came into power. Why, then, did they not also aid him, so as to restrain him from so many enormities? For if it is said that the gods had no hand in his success, this is no trivial admission that a man can attain the dearly <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> felicity of this life even though his own gods be not propitious; that men can be loaded with the gifts of fortune as Marius was, can enjoy health, power, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, honours, dignity, length of days, though the gods be hostile to him; and that, on the other hand, men can be tormented as Regulus was, with captivity, bondage, destitution, watchings, pain, and cruel death, though the gods be his friends. To concede this is to make a compendious confession that the gods are useless, and their worship superfluous. If the gods have taught the people rather what goes clean counter to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and that integrity of life which meets a reward after death; if even in respect of temporal and transitory blessings they neither hurt those whom they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> nor profit whom they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, why are they worshipped, why are they invoked with such eager homage? Why do men murmur in difficult and sad emergencies, as if the gods had retired in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>? And why, on their account, is the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> injured by the most unworthy <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>? If in temporal matters they have power either for good or for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, why did they stand by Marius, the worst of Rome's citizens, and abandon Regulus, the best? Does this not prove themselves to be most <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>? And even if it be supposed that for this very reason they are the rather to be feared and worshipped, this is a mistake; for we do not read that Regulus worshipped them less assiduously than Marius. &nbsp;Neither is it apparent that a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> life is to be chosen, on the ground that the gods are supposed to have favored Marius more than Regulus. For Metellus, the most highly esteemed of all the Romans, who had five sons in the consulship, was prosperous even in this life; and Catiline, the worst of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, reduced to poverty and defeated in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> his own guilt had aroused, lived and perished miserably. Real and secure felicity is the peculiar possession of those who worship that God by whom alone it can be conferred.</p>

<p>It is thus apparent, that when the republic was being destroyed by profligate manners, its gods did nothing to hinder its destruction by the direction or correction of its manners, but rather accelerated its destruction by increasing the demoralization and corruption that already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. They need not pretend that their goodness was shocked by the iniquity of the city, and that they withdrew in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.  For they were there, sure enough; they are detected, convicted: they were equally unable to break silence so as to guide others, and to keep silence so as to conceal themselves. I do not dwell on the fact that the inhabitants of Minturn&aelig; took pity on Marius, and commended him to the goddess Marica in her grove, that she might give him success in all things, and that from the abyss of despair in which he then lay he immediately returned unhurt to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and entered the city the ruthless leader of a ruthless army; and they who wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how bloody was his victory, how unlike a citizen, and how much more relentlessly than any foreign foe he acted, let them read the histories. But this, as I said, I do not dwell upon; nor do I attribute the bloody bliss of Marius to, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what Minturnian goddess [Marica], but rather to the secret <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the mouths of our adversaries might be shut, and that they who are not led by passion, but by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> consideration of events, might be delivered from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. And even if the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have any power in these matters, they have only that power which the secret decree of the Almighty allots to them, in order that we may not set too great store by earthly prosperity, seeing it is oftentimes vouchsafed even to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men like Marius; and that we may not, on the other hand, regard it as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, since we see that many good and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> worshippers of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God are, in spite of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> pre-eminently successful; and, finally, that we may not suppose that these unclean spirits are either to be propitiated or feared for the sake of earthly blessings or calamities: for as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men on earth cannot do all they would, so neither can these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but only in so far as they are permitted by the decree of Him whose judgments are fully comprehensible, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> reprehensible by none.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.&mdash; Of the Deeds of Sylla, in Which the Demons Boasted that He Had Their Help.</h2>

<p>It is certain that Sylla&mdash; whose rule was so cruel that, in comparison with it, the preceding state of things which he came to avenge was regretted&mdash; when first he advanced towards Rome to give battle to Marius, found the auspices so favourable when he <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, that, according to Livy's account, the augur Postumius expressed his willingness to lose his head if Sylla did not, with the help of the gods, accomplish what he designed. The gods, you see, had not departed from <q>every fane and sacred shrine,</q> since they were still predicting the issue of these affairs, and yet were taking no steps to correct Sylla himself. Their presages promised him great prosperity but no threatenings of theirs subdued his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. And then, when he was in Asia conducting the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Mithridates, a message from Jupiter was delivered to him by Lucius Titius, to the effect that he would conquer Mithridates; and so it came to pass. And afterwards, when he was meditating a return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the purpose of avenging in the blood of the citizens injuries done to himself and his friends, a second message from Jupiter was delivered to him by a soldier of the sixth legion, to the effect that it was he who had predicted the victory over Mithridates, and that now he promised to give him power to recover the republic from his enemies, though with great bloodshed. Sylla at once inquired of the soldier what form had appeared to him; and, on his reply, recognized that it was the same as Jupiter had formerly employed to convey to him the assurance regarding the victory over Mithridates. How, then, can the gods be justified in this matter for the care they took to predict these shadowy successes, and for their negligence in correcting Sylla, and restraining him from stirring up a civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> so lamentable and atrocious, that it not merely disfigured, but extinguished, the republic? The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, as I have often said, and as Scripture informs us, and as the facts themselves sufficiently indicate, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are found to look after their own ends only, that they may be regarded and worshipped as gods, and that men may be induced to offer to them a worship which associates them with their crimes, and involves them in one common <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when Sylla had come to Tarentum, and had <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> there, he saw on the head of the victim's liver the likeness of a golden crown. Thereupon the same soothsayer Postumius interpreted this to signify a signal victory, and ordered that he only should eat of the entrails. A little afterwards, the slave of a certain Lucius Pontius cried out, <q>I am Bellona's messenger; the victory is yours, Sylla!</q> Then he added that the Capitol should be burned. As soon as he had uttered this prediction he left the camp, but returned the following day more excited than ever, and shouted, <q>The Capitol is fired!</q> And fired indeed it was. This it was easy for a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> both to foresee and quickly to announce. But observe, as relevant to our subject, what kind of gods they are under whom these men desire to live, who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the Saviour that delivers the wills of the faithful from the dominion of devils. The man cried  out in prophetic rapture, <q>The victory is yours, Sylla!</q> And to certify that he spoke by a divine spirit, he predicted also an event which was shortly to happen, and which indeed did fall out, in a place from which he in whom this spirit was speaking was far distant. But he never cried, <q>Forbear your villanies, Sylla!</q>&mdash; the villanies which were committed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by that victor to whom a golden crown on the calf's liver had been shown as the divine evidence of his victory. If such signs as this were customarily sent by just gods, and not by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, then certainly the entrails he consulted should rather have given Sylla intimation of the cruel disasters that were to befall the city and himself. For that victory was not so conducive to his exaltation to power, as it was fatal to his ambition; for by it he became so insatiable in his desires, and was rendered so arrogant and reckless by prosperity, that he may be said rather to have inflicted a moral destruction on himself than corporal destruction on his enemies. But these truely woeful and deplorable calamities the gods gave him no previous hint of, neither by entrails, augury, dream, nor prediction. For they feared his amendment more than his defeat. Yea, they took good care that this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> conqueror of his own fellow citizens should be conquered and led captive by his own <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and should thus be the more submissive slave of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> themselves.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25.&mdash; How Powerfully the Evil Spirits Incite Men to Wicked Actions, by Giving Them the Quasi-Divine Authority of Their Example.</h2>

<p>Now, who does not hereby comprehend&mdash;unless he has preferred to imitate such gods rather than by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> to withdraw himself from their fellowship&mdash;who does not see how eagerly these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> strive by their example to lend, as it were, divine authority to crime? Is not this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the fact that they were seen in a wide plain in Campania rehearsing among themselves the battle which shortly after took place there with great bloodshed between the armies of Rome? For at first there were heard loud crashing noises, and afterwards many reported that they had seen for some days together two armies engaged. And when this battle ceased, they found the ground all indented with just such footprints of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and horses as a great conflict would leave. If, then, the deities were veritably fighting with one another, the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of men are sufficiently justified; yet, by the way, let it be observed that such pugnacious gods must be very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> or very wretched. If, however, it was but a sham-fight, what did they intend by this, but that the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the Romans should seem no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but an imitation of the gods? For already the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> had begun; and before this, some lamentable battles and execrable massacres had occurred. Already many had been moved by the story of the soldier, who, on stripping the spoils of his slain foe, recognized in the stripped corpse his own brother, and, with deep curses on civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, slew himself there and then on his brother's body. To disguise the bitterness of such tragedies, and kindle increasing ardor in this monstrous warfare, these malign <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who were reputed and worshipped as gods, fell upon this plan of revealing themselves in a state of civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, that no compunction for fellow citizens might <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the Romans to shrink from such battles, but that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> criminality might be justified by the divine example. By a like craft, too, did these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> command that scenic entertainments, of which I have already spoken, should be instituted and dedicated to them. And in these entertainments the poetical compositions and actions of the drama ascribed such iniquities to the gods, that every one might safely imitate them, whether he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the gods had actually done such things, or, not believing this, yet perceived that they most eagerly desired to be represented as having done them. And that no one might suppose, that in representing the gods as fighting with one another, the poets had <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> them, and imputed to them unworthy actions, the gods themselves, to complete the deception, confirmed the compositions of the poets by exhibiting their own battles to the eyes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not only through actions in the theatres, but in their own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> on the actual field.</p>

<p>We have been forced to bring forward these facts, because their authors have not scrupled to say and to write that the Roman republic had already been ruined by the depraved moral habits of the citizens, and had ceased to exist before the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. Now this ruin they do not impute to their own gods, though they impute to our Christ the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of this life, which cannot ruin good men, be they alive or dead. And this they do, though our Christ has issued so many precepts inculcating <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and restraining <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>; while their own gods have done nothing whatever to preserve that republic that served them, and to restrain it from ruin by such precepts, but have rather hastened its destruction, by corrupting its morality through their pestilent example. No one, I  fancy, will now be bold enough to say that the republic was then ruined because of the departure of the gods <q>from each fane, each sacred shrine,</q> as if they were the friends of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and were offended by the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of men. No, there are too many presages from entrails, auguries, soothsayings, whereby they boastingly proclaimed themselves prescient of future events and controllers of the fortune of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>&mdash;all which prove them to have been present. And had they been indeed absent the Romans would never in these civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> have been so far transported by their own <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> as they were by the instigations of these gods.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.&mdash; That the Demons Gave in Secret Certain Obscure Instructions in Morals, While in Public Their Own Solemnities Inculcated All Wickedness.</h2>

<p>Seeing that this is so&mdash;seeing that the filthy and cruel <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, the disgraceful and criminal actions of the gods, whether real or feigned, were at their own request published, and were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and dedicated in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> as sacred and stated solemnities; seeing they vowed vengeance on those who refused to exhibit them to the eyes of all, that they might be proposed as <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> worthy of imitation, why is it that these same <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who by taking pleasure in such obscenities, acknowledge themselves to be unclean spirits, and by delighting in their own villanies and iniquities, real or imaginary, and by requesting from the immodest, and extorting from the modest, the celebration of these licentious acts, proclaim themselves instigators to a criminal and lewd life&mdash;why, I ask, are they represented as giving some good moral precepts to a few of their own elect, initiated in the secrecy of their shrines? If it be so, this very thing only serves further to demonstrate the malicious craft of these pestilent spirits. For so great is the influence of probity and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or almost all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, are moved by the praise of these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; nor is any man so depraved by <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but he has some feeling of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> left in him. So that, unless the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> sometimes transformed himself, as <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light, <span class="stiki" id="note120115"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:14</a></span> he could not compass his deceitful purpose. Accordingly, in public, a bold impurity fills the ear of the people with noisy clamor; in private, a feigned <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> speaks in scarce audible whispers to a few: an open stage is provided for shameful things, but on the praiseworthy the curtain falls: <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> hides disgrace flaunts: a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> deed draws an overflowing house, a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> speech finds scarce a hearer, as though purity were to be blushed at, impurity boasted of. Where else can such confusion reign, but in devils' temples? Where, but in the haunts of deceit? For the secret precepts are given as a sop to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, who are few in number; the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> examples are exhibited to encourage the vicious, who are countless.</p>

<p>Where and when those initiated in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of C&oelig;lestis received any good instructions, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. What we do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is, that before her shrine, in which her image is set, and amidst a vast crowd gathering from all quarters, and standing closely packed together, we were intensely interested spectators of the games which were going on, and saw, as we pleased to turn the eye, on this side a grand display of harlots, on the other the virgin goddess; we saw this virgin worshipped with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and with obscene <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. There we saw no shame-faced mimes, no actress over-burdened with modesty; all that the obscene <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> demanded was fully complied with. We were plainly shown what was pleasing to the virgin deity, and the matron who witnessed the spectacle returned home from the temple a wiser <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Some, indeed, of the more <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> turned their faces from the immodest movements of the players, and learned the art of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> by a furtive regard. For they were restrained, by the modest demeanor due to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, from looking boldly at the immodest gestures; but much more were they restrained from condemning with chaste heart the sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of her whom they adored. And yet this licentiousness&mdash; which, if practised in one's home, could only be done there in secret&mdash; was practised as a public lesson in the temple; and if any modesty remained in men, it was occupied in marvelling that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> which men could not unrestrainedly commit should be part of the religious teaching of the gods, and that to omit its exhibition should incur the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of the gods. What spirit can that be, which by a hidden inspiration stirs men's corruption, and goads them to <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and feeds on the full-fledged iniquity, unless it be the same that finds pleasure in such religious ceremonies, sets in the temples images of devils, and loves to see in play the images of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>; that whispers in secret some righteous sayings to deceive the few who are good, and scatters in public invitations to profligacy, to gain possession of the millions who are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 27.&mdash; That the Obscenities of Those Plays Which the Romans Consecrated in Order to Propitiate Their Gods, Contributed Largely to the Overthrow of Public Order.</h2>

<p>Cicero, a weighty man, and a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> in his way, when about to be made edile, wished the citizens to understand  that, among the other duties of his magistracy, he must propitiate Flora by the celebration of games. And these games are reckoned devout in proportion to their lewdness. In another place,  and when he was now consul, and the state in great peril, he says that games had been celebrated for ten days together, and that nothing had been omitted which could pacify the gods: as if it had not been more satisfactory to irritate the gods by <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, than to pacify them by debauchery; and to provoke their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> by honest living, than soothe it by such unseemly grossness. For no matter how cruel was the ferocity of those men who were threatening the state, and on whose account the gods were being propitiated, it could not have been more hurtful than the alliance of gods who were won with the foulest <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. To avert the danger which threatened men's bodies, the gods were conciliated in a fashion that drove <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from their spirits; and the gods did not enrol themselves as defenders of the battlements against the besiegers, until they had first stormed and sacked the morality of the citizens. This propitiation of such divinities,&mdash; a propitiation so wanton, so impure, so immodest, so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, so filthy, whose actors the innate and praiseworthy <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the Romans disabled from civic <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, erased from their tribe, recognized as polluted and made <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a>&mdash;this propitiation, I say, so foul, so detestable, and alien from every religious feeling, these fabulous and ensnaring accounts of the criminal actions of the gods, these scandalous actions which they either shamefully and wickedly committed, or more shamefully and wickedly feigned, all this the whole city learned in public both by the words and gestures of the actors. They saw that the gods delighted in the commission of these things, and therefore <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that they wished them not only to be exhibited to them, but to be imitated by themselves. But as for that good and honest instruction which they speak of, it was given in such secrecy, and to so few (if indeed given at all), that they seemed rather to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> it might be divulged, than that it might not be practised.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28.&mdash; That the Christian Religion is Health-Giving.</h2>

<p>They, then, are but abandoned and ungrateful wretches, in deep and fast bondage to that malign spirit, who complain and murmur that men are rescued by the name of Christ from the hellish thraldom of these unclean spirits, and from a participation in their punishment, and are brought out of the night of pestilential ungodliness into the light of most healthful <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Only such men could murmur that the masses flock to the churches and their chaste acts of worship, where a seemly separation of the sexes is observed; where they learn how they may so spend this earthly life, as to merit a blessed <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> hereafter; where <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and instruction in righteousness are proclaimed from a raised platform in presence of all, that both they who do the word may hear to their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and they who do it not may hear to judgment. And though some enter who scoff at such precepts, all their petulance is either quenched by a sudden change, or is restrained through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or shame. For no filthy and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> action is there set forth to be gazed at or to be imitated; but either the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God are recommended, His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> narrated, His gifts praised, or His benefits implored.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29.&mdash; An Exhortation to the Romans to Renounce Paganism.</h2>

<p>This, rather, is the religion worthy of your desires, O admirable Roman race&mdash;the progeny of your Sc&aelig;volas and Scipios, of Regulus, and of Fabricius. This rather <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>, this distinguish from that foul vanity and crafty <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the devils. If there is in your nature any eminent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, only by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is it purged and perfected, while by impiety it is wrecked and punished. Choose now what you will pursue, that your praise may be not in yourself, but in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whom is no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For of popular <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> you have had your share; but by the secret <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion was not offered to your choice. Awake, it is now day; as you have already awaked in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of some in whose perfect <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and sufferings for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: for they, contending on all sides with hostile powers, and conquering them all by bravely dying, have purchased for us this country of ours with their blood; to which country we invite you, and exhort you to add yourselves to the number of the citizens of this city, which also has a sanctuary  of its own in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.  Do not listen to those degenerate sons of yours who <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> Christ and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and impute to them these disastrous times, though they desire times in which they may enjoy rather impunity for their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> than a peaceful life. Such has never been Rome's ambition even in regard to her earthly country. Lay hold now on the celestial country, which is easily won, and in which you will reign <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and for ever. For there shall you find no vestal fire, no Capitoline stone, but the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</p>

<blockquote><p>No date, no goal will here ordain:<br>
But grant an endless, boundless reign. </p></blockquote>

<p>No longer, then, follow after false and deceitful gods; abjure them rather, and despise them, bursting forth into <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> liberty. Gods they are not, but malignant spirits, to whom your <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> will be a sore punishment. Juno, from whom you deduce your origin according to the flesh, did not so bitterly grudge Rome's citadels to the Trojans, as these devils whom yet you repute gods, grudge an everlasting seat to the race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. And you yourself hast in no wavering voice passed judgment on them, when you pacified them with games, and yet accounted as <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> the men by whom the plays were acted. Suffer us, then, to assert your freedom against the unclean spirits who had imposed on your neck the yoke of celebrating their own shame and filthiness. The actors of these divine crimes you have removed from offices of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; supplicate the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He may remove from you those gods who delight in their crimes&mdash;a most disgraceful thing if the crimes are really theirs, and a most malicious invention if the crimes are feigned. Well done, in that you have spontaneously banished from the number of your citizens all actors and players. Awake more fully: the majesty of God cannot be propitiated by that which defiles the dignity of man. How, then, can you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that gods who take pleasure in such lewd plays, belong to the number of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> powers of heaven, when the men by whom these plays are acted are by yourselves refused admission into the number of Roman citizens even of the lowest grade? Incomparably more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> than Rome, is that heavenly city in which for victory you have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for dignity, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; for peace, felicity; for life, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Much less does it admit into its society such gods, if you blush to admit such men into yours. Wherefore, if you would attain to the blessed city, shun the society of devils. They who are propitiated by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of shame, are unworthy of the worship of right-hearted men. Let these, then, be obliterated from your worship by the cleansing of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, as those men were blotted from your citizenship by the censor's mark.</p>

<p>But, so far as regards carnal benefits, which are the only blessings the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> desire to enjoy, and carnal miseries, which alone they shrink from enduring, we will show in the following book that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have not the power they are supposed to have; and although they had it, we ought rather on that account to despise these blessings, than for the sake of them to worship those gods, and by worshipping them to miss the attainment of these blessings they grudge us. But that they have not even this power which is ascribed to them by those who worship them for the sake of temporal advantages, this, I say, I will prove in the following book; so let us here close the present argument.</p>
