<h1>The City of God (Book IX)</h1>

<p class="h1a">Having in the preceding book shown that the worship of demons must be abjured, since they in a thousand ways proclaim themselves to be wicked spirits, Augustine in this book meets those who allege a distinction among demons, some being evil, while others are good; and, having exploded this distinction, he proves that to no demon, but to Christ alone, belongs the office of providing men with eternal blessedness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; The Point at Which the Discussion Has Arrived, and What Remains to Be Handled.</h2>

<p>Some have advanced the opinion that there are both good and bad gods; but some, thinking more respectfully of the gods, have attributed to them so much <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and praise as to preclude the supposition of any god being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. But those who have maintained that there are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> gods as well as good ones have included the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> under the name <q>gods,</q> and sometimes though more rarely, have called the gods <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; so that they admit that Jupiter, whom they make the king and head of all the rest, is called a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> by Homer.  Those, on the other hand, who maintain that the gods are all good, and far more excellent than the men who are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> called good, are moved by the actions of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, which they can neither deny nor impute to the gods whose goodness they affirm, to distinguish between gods and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; so that, whenever they find anything offensive in the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> or sentiments by which unseen spirits manifest their power, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this to proceed not from the gods, but from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. At the same time they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, as no god can hold direct intercourse with men, these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> hold the position of mediators, ascending with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and returning with gifts. This is the opinion of the Platonists, the ablest and most esteemed of their <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, with whom we therefore chose to debate this question&mdash;whether the worship of a number of gods is of any service toward obtaining blessedness in the future life. And this is the reason why, in the preceding book, we have inquired how the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who take pleasure in such things as good and wise men loathe and execrate, in the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> and immoral fictions which the poets have written not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but of the gods themselves, and in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and criminal <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of magical arts, can be regarded as more nearly related and more friendly to the gods than men are, and can mediate between good men and the good gods; and it has been demonstrated that this is absolutely impossible.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; Whether Among the Demons, Inferior to the Gods, There are Any Good Spirits Under Whose Guardianship the Human Soul Might Reach True Blessedness.</h2>

<p>This book, then, ought, according to the promise made in the end of the preceding one, to contain a discussion, not of the difference which exists among the gods, who, according to the Platonists, are all good, nor of the difference between gods and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, the former of whom they separate by a wide interval from men, while the latter are placed intermediately between the gods and men, but of the difference, since they make one, among the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> themselves. This we shall discuss so far as it bears on our theme. It has been the common and usual belief that some of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are bad, others good; and this opinon, whether it be that of the Platonists or any  other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, must by no means be passed over in silence, lest some one suppose he ought to cultivate the good <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> in order that by their mediation he may be accepted by the gods, all of whom he believes to be good, and that he may live with them after death; whereas he would thus be ensnared in the toils of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits, and would wander far from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with whom alone, and in whom alone, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that is to say, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is rational and intellectual, is blessed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; What Apuleius Attributes to the Demons, to Whom, Though He Does Not Deny Them Reason, He Does Not Ascribe Virtue.</h2>

<p>What, then, is the difference between good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>? For the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> Apuleius, in a treatise on this whole subject,  while he says a great deal about their aerial bodies, has not a word to say of the spiritual <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> with which, if they were good, they must have been endowed. Not a word has he said, then, of that which could give them <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; but <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their misery he has given, acknowledging that their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, by which they rank as reasonable beings, is not only not imbued and fortified with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> so as to resist all unreasonable <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but that it is somehow agitated with tempestuous emotions, and is thus on a level with the mind of foolish men. His own words are: <q>It is this class of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> the poets refer to, when, without serious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, they feign that the gods <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> individuals among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, prospering and ennobling some, and opposing and distressing others. Therefore pity, indignation, grief, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> emotion is experienced by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, with the same mental disturbance, and the same tide of feeling and thought. These turmoils and tempests banish them far from the tranquility of the celestial gods.</q> Can there be any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that in these words it is not some inferior part of their spiritual nature, but the very mind by which the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> hold their rank as rational beings, which he says is tossed with passion like a stormy sea? They cannot, then, be compared even to wise men, who with undisturbed mind resist these perturbations to which they are exposed in this life, and from which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity is never exempt, and who do not yield themselves to approve of or perpetrate anything which might deflect them from the path of wisdom and law of rectitude. They resemble in character, though not in bodily appearance, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and foolish men. I might indeed say they are worse, inasmuch as they have grown old in iniquity, and incorrigible by punishment. Their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as Apuleius says, is a sea tossed with tempest, having no rallying point of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from which they can resist their turbulent and depraved emotions.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; The Opinion of the Peripatetics and Stoics About Mental Emotions.</h2>

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> there are two opinions about these mental emotions, which the Greeks call <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x03B7;</span>, while some of our own writers, as Cicero, call them perturbations,  some affections, and some, to render the Greek word more accurately, <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. Some say that even the wise man is subject to these perturbations, though moderated and controlled by reason, which imposes <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> upon them, and so restrains them within necessary bounds. This is the opinion of the Platonists and Aristotelians; for Aristotle was <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, and the founder of the Peripatetic school. But others, as the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, are of opinion that the wise man is not subject to these perturbations. But Cicero, in his book <em>De Finibus</em>, shows that the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> are here at variance with the Platonists and Peripatetics rather in words than in reality; for the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> decline to apply the term <q>goods</q> to external and bodily advantages,  because they reckon that the only good is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the art of living well, and this exists only in the mind. The other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, again, use the simple and customary phraseology, and do not scruple to call these things goods, though in comparison of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which guides our life, they are little and of small esteem. And thus it is obvious that, whether these outward things are called goods or advantages, they are held in the same estimation by both parties, and that in this matter the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> are pleasing themselves merely with a novel phraseology. It seems, then, to me that in this question, whether the wise man is subject to mental <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, or wholly free from them, the controversy is one of words rather than of things; for I think that, if the reality and not the mere sound of the words is considered, the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> hold precisely the same opinion as the Platonists and Peripatetics. For, omitting for brevity's sake other <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> which I might adduce in support of this opinion, I will state but one which I consider conclusive. Aulus Gellius, a man of extensive erudition, and gifted with an eloquent and graceful  style, relates, in his work entitled <em>Noctes</em> <em> Attic&aelig;</em> that he once made a voyage with an eminent Stoic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>; and he goes on to relate fully and with gusto what I shall barely state, that when the ship was tossed and in danger from a violent storm, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> grew pale with terror. This was noticed by those on board, who, though themselves threatened with death, were curious to see whether a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> would be agitated like other men. When the tempest had passed over, and as soon as their security gave them freedom to resume their talk, one of the passengers, a rich and luxurious Asiatic, begins to banter the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and rally him because he had even become pale with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, while he himself had been unmoved by the impending destruction. But the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> availed himself of the reply of Aristippus the Socratic, who, on finding himself similarly bantered by a man of the same character, answered, <q>You had no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for anxiety for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a profligate debauchee, but I had reason to be alarmed for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Aristippus.</q> The rich man being thus disposed of, Aulus Gellius asked the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, in the interests of science and not to annoy him, what was the reason of his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? And he willing to instruct a man so <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, at once took from his wallet a book of Epictetus the Stoic,  in which doctrines were advanced which precisely harmonized with those of Zeno and Chrysippus, the founders of the Stoical school. Aulus Gellius says that he read in this book that the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> maintain that there are certain impressions made on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by external objects which they call <em>phantasi&aelig;</em>, and that it is not in the power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to determine whether or when it shall be invaded by these. When these impressions are made by alarming and formidable objects, it must needs be that they move the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> even of the wise man, so that for a little he trembles with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, or is depressed by sadness, these impressions anticipating the work of reason and self-control; but this does not imply that the mind accepts these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> impressions, or approves or consents to them. For this consent is, they think, in a man's power; there being this difference between the mind of the wise man and that of the fool, that the fool's mind yields to these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and consents to them, while that of the wise man, though it cannot help being invaded by them, yet retains with unshaken firmness a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and steady persuasion of those things which it ought rationally to desire or avoid. This account of what Aulus Gellius relates that he read in the book of Epictetus about the sentiments and doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> I have given as well as I could, not, perhaps, with his choice language, but with greater brevity, and, I think, with greater clearness. And if this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, then there is no difference, or next to none, between the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> and that of the other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> regarding mental <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and perturbations, for both parties agree in maintaining that the mind and reason of the wise man are not subject to these. And perhaps what the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> mean by asserting this, is that the wisdom which characterizes the wise man is clouded by no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and sullied by no taint, but, with this reservation that his wisdom remains undisturbed, he is exposed to the impressions which the goods and ills of this life (or, as they prefer to call them, the advantages or disadvantages) make upon them. For we need not say that if that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> had thought nothing of those things which he thought he was immediately to lose, life and bodily safety, he would not have been so terrified by his danger as to betray his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> by the pallor of his cheek. Nevertheless, he might suffer this mental disturbance, and yet maintain the fixed persuasion that life and bodily safety, which the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the tempest threatened to destroy, are not those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which make their possessors good, as the possession of righteousness does. But in so far as they persist that we must call them not goods but advantages, they quarrel about words and neglect things. For what difference does it make whether goods or advantages be the better name, while the Stoic no less than the Peripatetic is alarmed at the prospect of losing them, and while, though they name them differently, they hold them in like esteem? Both parties assure us that, if urged to the commission of some immorality or crime by the threatened loss of these goods or advantages, they would prefer to lose such things as preserve bodily comfort and security rather than commit such things as violate righteousness. And thus the mind in which this resolution is well grounded suffers no perturbations to prevail with it in opposition to reason, even though they assail the weaker parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and not only so, but it rules over them, and, while it refuses its consent and resists them, administers a reign of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Such a character is ascribed to &AElig;neas by Virgil when he says,</p>

<blockquote><p>He stands immovable by tears,<br>
Nor tenderest words with pity hears. </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; That the Passions Which Assail the Souls of Christians Do Not Seduce Them to Vice, But Exercise Their Virtue.</h2>

<p>We need not at present give a careful and copious exposition of the doctrine of Scripture, the sum of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, regarding these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. It subjects the mind itself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He may rule and aid it, and the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, again, to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to moderate and bridle them, and turn them to righteous uses. In our ethics, we do not so much inquire whether a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, as why he is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>; not whether he is sad, but what is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his sadness; not whether he fears, but what he fears. For I am not aware that any right thinking person would find fault with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> at a wrongdoer which seeks his amendment, or with sadness which intends relief to the suffering, or with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest one in danger be destroyed. The <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, indeed, are accustomed to condemn compassion.  But how much more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> had it been in that Stoic we have been telling of, had he been disturbed by compassion prompting him to relieve a fellow-creature, than to be disturbed by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of shipwreck! Far better and more humane, and more consonant with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> sentiments, are the words of Cicero in praise of C&aelig;sar, when he says, <q>Among your <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> none is more admirable and agreeable than your compassion.</q>  And what is compassion but a fellow-feeling for another's misery, which prompts us to help him if we can? And this emotion is <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to reason, when compassion is shown without violating right, as when the poor are relieved, or the penitent forgiven. Cicero, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to use language, did not hesitate to call this a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> are not ashamed to reckon among the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, although, as the book of the eminent Stoic, Epictetus, quoting the opinions of Zeno and Chrysippus, the founders of the school, has taught us, they admit that <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of this kind invade the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the wise man, whom they would have to be free from all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Whence it follows that these very <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are not judged by them to be <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, since they assail the wise man without forcing him to act against reason and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and that, therefore, the opinion of the Peripatetics or Platonists and of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> is one and the same. But, as Cicero says,  mere logomachy is the bane of these pitiful Greeks, who thirst for contention rather than for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. However, it may <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> be asked, whether our subjection to these affections, even while we follow <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is a part of the infirmity of this life? For the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> feel no <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> while they punish those whom the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law of God consigns to punishment, no fellow-feeling with misery while they relieve the miserable, no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> while they aid those who are in danger; and yet ordinary language ascribes to them also these mental emotions, because, though they have none of our weakness, their acts resemble the actions to which these emotions move us; and thus even God Himself is said in Scripture to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and yet without any perturbation. For this word is used of the effect of His vengeance, not of the disturbing mental affection.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; Of the Passions Which, According to Apuleius, Agitate the Demons Who Are Supposed by Him to Mediate Between Gods and Men.</h2>

<p>Deferring for the present the question about the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, let us examine the opinion of the Platonists, that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who mediate between gods and men are agitated by <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For if their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, though exposed to their incursion, still remained free and superior to them, Apuleius could not have said that their hearts are tossed with <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> as the sea by stormy winds.  Their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, then&mdash;that superior part of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> whereby they are rational beings, and which, if it actually exists in them, should rule and bridle the turbulent <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the inferior parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash;this mind of theirs, I say, is, according to the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> referred to, tossed with a hurricane of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. The mind of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, therefore, is subject to the emotions of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and all similar affections. What part of them, then, is free, and endued with wisdom, so that they are pleasing to the gods, and the fit guides of men into purity of life, since their very highest part, being the slave of passion and subject to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, only makes them more intent on deceiving and seducing, in proportion to the mental force and energy of desire they possess?</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; That the Platonists Maintain that the Poets Wrong the Gods by Representing Them as Distracted by Party Feeling, to Which the Demons and Not the Gods, are Subject.</h2>

<p>But if any one says that it is not of all the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but only of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, that the poets, not without <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, say that they violently <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> certain men,&mdash; for it was of them Apuleius said that they were driven about by strong currents of emotion&mdash;how  can we accept this interpretation, when Apuleius, in the very same connection, represents all the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and not only the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, as intermediate between gods and men by their aerial bodies? The fiction of the poets, according to him, consists in their making gods of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and giving them the names of gods, and assigning them as allies or enemies to individual men, using this poetical license, though they profess that the gods are very different in character from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and far exalted above them by their celestial abode and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of beatitude. This, I say, is the poets' fiction, to say that these are gods who are not gods, and that, under the names of gods, they fight among themselves about the men whom they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> with keen partisan feeling. Apuleius says that this is not far from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since, though they are wrongfully called by the names of the gods, they are described in their own proper character as <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. To this category, he says, belongs the Minerva of Homer, <q>who interposed in the ranks of the Greeks to restrain Achilles.</q>  For that this was Minerva he supposes to be poetical fiction; for he thinks that Minerva is a goddess, and he places her among the gods whom he believes to be all good and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the sublime ethereal region, remote from intercourse with men. But that there was a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> favorable to the Greeks and adverse to the Trojans, as another, whom the same poet mentions under the name of Venus or Mars (gods exalted above earthly affairs in their heavenly habitations), was the Trojans' ally and the foe of the Greeks, and that these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> fought for those they loved against those they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>&mdash;in all this he owned that the poets stated something very like the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For they made these statements about beings to whom he ascribes the same violent and tempestuous <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> as disturb men, and who are therefore capable of loves and hatreds not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> formed, but formed in a party spirit, as the spectators in races or hunts take fancies and prejudices. It seems to have been the great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of this <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> that the poetical fictions should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> of the gods, and not of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who bore their names.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; How Apuleius Defines the Gods Who Dwell in Heaven, the Demons Who Occupy the Air, and Men Who Inhabit Earth.</h2>

<p>The definition which Apuleius gives of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and in which he of course includes all <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, is that they are in nature animals, in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> subject to passion, in mind reasonable, in body aerial, in duration <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Now in these five qualities he has named absolutely nothing which is proper to good men and not also to bad. For when Apuleius had spoken of the celestials first, and had then extended his description so as to include an account of those who dwell far below on the earth, that, after describing the two extremes of rational being, he might proceed to speak of the intermediate <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, he says, <q>Men, therefore, who are endowed with the faculty of reason and speech, whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and their members mortal, who have weak and anxious spirits, dull and corruptible bodies, dissimilar characters, similar <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, who are obstinate in their audacity, and persistent in their hope, whose labor is vain, and whose fortune is ever on the wane, their race <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, themselves perishing, each generation replenished with creatures whose life is swift and their wisdom slow, their death sudden and their life a wail,&mdash; these are the men who dwell on the earth.</q>  In recounting so many qualities which belong to the large proportion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, did he forget that which is the property of the few when he speaks of their wisdom being slow? If this had been omitted, this his description of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, so carefully elaborated, would have been defective. And when he commended the excellence of the gods, he affirmed that they excelled in that very blessedness to which he thinks men must attain by wisdom. And therefore, if he had wished us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that some of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are good, he should have inserted in his description something by which we might see that they have, in common with the gods, some share of blessedness, or, in common with men, some wisdom. But, as it is, he has mentioned no good quality by which the good may be distinguished from the bad. For although he refrained from giving a full account of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of offending, not themselves but their worshippers, for whom he was writing, yet he sufficiently indicated to discerning readers what opinion he had of them; for only in the one article of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of their bodies does he assimilate them to the gods, all of whom, he asserts, are good and blessed, and absolutely free from what he himself calls the stormy <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; and as to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he quite plainly affirms that they resemble men and not the gods, and that this resemblance lies not in the possession of wisdom, which even men can attain to, but in the perturbation of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which sway the foolish and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but  is so ruled by the good and wise that they prefer not to admit rather than to conquer it. For if he had wished it to be understood that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> resembled the gods in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> not of their bodies but of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, he would certainly have admitted men to share in this privilege, because, as a <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a>, he of course must hold that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Accordingly, when describing this race of living beings, he said that their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, their members mortal. And, consequently, if men have not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in common with the gods because they have mortal bodies, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in common with the gods because their bodies are <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; Whether the Intercession of the Demons Can Secure for Men the Friendship of the Celestial Gods.</h2>

<p>How, then, can men hope for a favorable introduction to the friendship of the gods by such mediators as these, who are, like men, defective in that which is the better part of every living creature, viz., the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and who resemble the gods only in the body, which is the inferior part? For a living creature or animal consists of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, and of these two parts the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is undoubtedly the better; even though vicious and weak, it is obviously better than even the soundest and strongest body, for the greater excellence of its nature is not reduced to the level of the body even by the pollution of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, as gold, even when tarnished, is more precious than the purest silver or lead. And yet these mediators, by whose interposition things <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and divine are to be harmonized, have an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> body in common with the gods, and a vicious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in common with men,&mdash; as if the religion by which these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are to unite gods and men were a bodily, and not a spiritual matter. What <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, then, or punishment has suspended these false and deceitful mediators, as it were head downwards, so that their inferior part, their body, is linked to the gods above, and their superior part, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, bound to men beneath; united to the celestial gods by the part that serves, and miserable, together with the inhabitants of earth, by the part that rules? For the body is the servant, as Sallust says: <q>We use the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to rule, the body to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>;</q>  adding, <q>the one we have in common with the gods, the other with the brutes.</q> For he was here speaking of men; and they have, like the brutes, a mortal body. These <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, whom our <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> friends have provided for us as mediators with the gods, may indeed say of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, the one we have in common with the gods, the other with men; but, as I said, they are as it were suspended and bound head downwards, having the slave, the body, in common with the gods, the master, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in common with miserable men,&mdash; their inferior part exalted, their superior part depressed. And therefore, if any one supposes that, because they are not subject, like terrestrial animals, to the separation of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body by death, they therefore resemble the gods in their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, their body must not be considered a chariot of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> triumph, but rather the chain of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; That, According to Plotinus, Men, Whose Body is Mortal, are Less Wretched Than Demons, Whose Body is Eternal.</h2>

<p>Plotinus, whose memory is quite recent,  enjoys the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of having understood <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> better than any other of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. In speaking of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, he says, <q>The Father in compassion made their bonds mortal;</q>  that is to say, he considered it due to the Father's mercy that men, having a mortal body, should not be forever confined in the misery of this life. But of this mercy the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have been judged unworthy, and they have received, in conjunction with a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, a body not mortal like man's, but <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. For they should have been happier than men if they had, like men, had a mortal body, and, like the gods, a blessed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And they should have been equal to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, if in conjunction with a miserable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> they had at least received, like men, a mortal body, so that death might have freed them from trouble, if, at least, they should have attained some degree of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. But, as it is, they are not only no happier than men, having, like them, a miserable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, they are also more wretched, being <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> bound to the body; for he does not leave us to infer that by some progress in wisdom and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> they can become gods, but expressly says that they are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> forever.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; Of the Opinion of the Platonists, that the Souls of Men Become Demons When Disembodied.</h2>

<p>He  says, indeed, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and that men become <em>Lares</em> if they are good, <em> Lemures</em> or <em>Larv&aelig;</em> if they are bad, and <em>Manes</em> if it is uncertain whether they de  serve well or ill. Who does not see at a glance that this is a mere whirlpool sucking men to moral destruction? For, however <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men have been, if they suppose they shall become Larv&aelig; or divine Manes, they will become the worse the more <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> they have for inflicting injury; for, as the Larv&aelig; are hurtful <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> made out of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, these men must suppose that after death they will be invoked with <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> that they may inflict injuries. But this question we must not pursue. He also states that the blessed are called in Greek <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03B4;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x03C2;</span>, because they are good <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, that is to say, good <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, confirming his opinion that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; Of the Three Opposite Qualities by Which the Platonists Distinguish Between the Nature of Men and that of Demons.</h2>

<p>But at present we are speaking of those beings whom he described as being properly intermediate between gods and men, in nature animals, in mind rational, in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> subject to passion, in body aerial, in duration <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. When he had distinguished the gods, whom he placed in the highest heaven, from men, whom he placed on earth, not only by position but also by the unequal dignity of their natures, he concluded in these words: <q>You have here two kinds of animals: the gods, widely distinguished from men by sublimity of abode, perpetuity of life, perfection of nature; for their habitations are separated by so wide an interval that there can be no intimate communication between them, and while the vitality of the one is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and indefeasible, that of the others is fading and precarious, and while the spirits of the gods are exalted in bliss, those of men are sunk in miseries.</q>  Here I find three opposite qualities ascribed to the extremes of being, the highest and lowest. For, after mentioning the three qualities for which we are to admire the gods, he repeated, though in other words, the same three as a foil to the defects of man. The three qualities are, <q>sublimity of abode, perpetuity of life, perfection of nature.</q> These he again mentioned so as to bring out their contrasts in man's condition. &nbsp;As he had mentioned <q>sublimity of abode,</q> he says, <q>Their habitations are separated by so wide an interval;</q> as he had mentioned <q>perpetuity of life,</q> he says, that <q>while divine life is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and indefeasible, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life is fading and precarious;</q> and as he had mentioned <q>perfection of nature,</q> he says, that <q>while the spirits of the gods are exalted in bliss, those of men are sunk in miseries.</q> These three things, then, he predicates of the gods, exaltation, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, blessedness; and of man he predicates the opposite, lowliness of habitation, mortality, misery.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; How the Demons Can Mediate Between Gods and Men If They Have Nothing in Common with Both, Being Neither Blessed Like the Gods, Nor Miserable Like Men.</h2>

<p>If, now, we endeavor to find between these opposites the mean occupied by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, there can be no question as to their local position; for, between the highest and lowest place, there is a place which is rightly considered and called the middle place. The other two qualities remain, and to them we must give greater care, that we may see whether they are altogether foreign to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, or how they are so bestowed upon them without infringing upon their mediate position. We may dismiss the idea that they are foreign to them. For we cannot say that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, being rational animals, are neither blessed nor wretched, as we say of the beasts and plants, which are void of feeling and reason, or as we say of the middle place, that it is neither the highest nor the lowest. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, being rational, must be either miserable or blessed. And, in like manner, we cannot say that they are neither mortal nor <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; for all living things either live <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> or end life in death. Our author, besides, stated that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. What remains for us to suppose, then, but that these mediate beings are assimilated to the gods in one of the two remaining qualities, and to men in the other? For if they received both from above, or both from beneath, they should no longer be mediate, but either rise to the gods above, or sink to men beneath. Therefore, as it has been demonstrated that they must possess these two qualities, they will hold their middle place if they receive one from each party. Consequently, as they cannot receive their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> from beneath, because it is not there to receive, they must get it from above; and accordingly they have no choice but to complete their mediate position by accepting misery from men.</p>

<p>According to the Platonists, then, the gods, who occupy the highest place, enjoy <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessedness, or blessed <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; men, who occupy the lowest, a mortal misery, or a miserable mortality; and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who occupy the mean, a miserable <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, or an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> misery. As to those five things which Apuleius  included in his definition of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, he did not show, as he promised, that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are mediate. For three of them, that their nature is animal, their mind rational, their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, he said that they have in common with men; one thing, their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, in common with the gods; and one proper to themselves, their aerial body. How, then, are they intermediate, when they have three things in common with the lowest, and only one in common with the highest? Who does not see that the intermediate position is abandoned in proportion as they tend to, and are depressed towards, the lowest extreme? But perhaps we are to accept them as intermediate because of their one property of an aerial body, as the two extremes have each their proper body, the gods an ethereal, men a terrestrial body, and because two of the qualities they possess in common with man they possess also in common with the gods, namely, their animal nature and rational mind. For Apuleius himself, in speaking of gods and men, said, <q>You have two animal natures.</q> And Platonists are wont to ascribe a rational mind to the gods. Two qualities remain, their liability to passion, and their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>&mdash;the first of which they have in common with men, the second with the gods; so that they are neither wafted to the highest nor depressed to the lowest extreme, but perfectly poised in their intermediate position. But then, this is the very circumstance which constitutes the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> misery, or miserable <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For he who says that their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is subject to <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> would also have said that they are miserable, had he not blushed for their worshippers. Moreover, as the world is governed, not by fortuitous haphazard, but, as the Platonists themselves avow, by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of the supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the misery of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> would not be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> unless their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> were great.</p>

<p>If, then, the blessed are rightly styled <em>eudemons</em>, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> intermediate between gods and men are not eudemons. What, then, is the local position of those good <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who, above men but beneath the gods, afford assistance to the former, minister to the latter? For if they are good and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, they are doubtless blessed. But <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessedness destroys their intermediate character, giving them a close resemblance to the gods, and widely separating them from men. And therefore the Platonists will in vain strive to show how the good <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, if they are both <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and blessed, can <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> be said to hold a middle place between the gods, who are <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and blessed, and men, who are mortal and miserable. For if they have both <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and blessedness in common with the gods, and neither of these in common with men, who are both miserable and mortal, are they not rather remote from men and united with the gods, than intermediate between them. They would be intermediate if they held one of their qualities in common with the one party, and the other with the other, as man is a kind of mean between <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and beasts&mdash;the beast being an irrational and mortal animal, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> a rational and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> one, while man, inferior to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and superior to the beast, and having in common with the one mortality, and with the other reason, is a rational and mortal animal. So, when we seek for an intermediate between the blessed immortals and miserable mortals, we should find a being which is either mortal and blessed, or <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and miserable.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; Whether Men, Though Mortal, Can Enjoy True Blessedness.</h2>

<p>It is a great question among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whether man can be mortal and blessed. Some, taking the humbler view of his condition, have denied that he is capable of blessedness so long as he continues in this mortal life; others, again, have spurned this idea, and have been bold enough to maintain that, even though mortal, men may be blessed by attaining wisdom. But if this be the case, why are not these wise men constituted mediators between miserable mortals and the blessed immortals, since they have blessedness in common with the latter, and mortality in common with the former? Certainly, if they are blessed, they <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> no one (for what more miserable than <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>?), but seek with all their might to help miserable mortals on to blessedness, so that after death they may become <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and be associated with the blessed and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; Of the Man Christ Jesus, the Mediator Between God and Men.</h2>

<p>But if, as is much more probable and credible, it must needs be that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, so long as they are mortal, are also miserable, we must seek an intermediate who is not only man, but also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that, by the interposition of His blessed mortality, He may bring men out of their mortal misery to a blessed <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. In this intermediate two things are requisite, that He become mortal, and that He do not continue mortal. He did become mortal, not rendering the divinity of the Word infirm, but assuming the infirmity of flesh. Neither did He continue mortal in the flesh, but raised it from the dead; for it is the very fruit of His  mediation that those, for the sake of whose redemption He became the Mediator, should not abide <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> in bodily death. Wherefore it became the Mediator between us and God to have both a transient mortality and a permanent blessedness, that by that which is transient He might be assimilated to mortals, and might translate them from mortality to that which is permanent. Good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, therefore, cannot mediate between miserable mortals and blessed immortals, for they themselves also are both blessed and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can mediate, because they are <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> like the one party, miserable like the other. To these is opposed the good Mediator, who, in opposition to their <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and misery, has chosen to be mortal for a time, and has been able to continue <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. It is thus He has destroyed, by the humility of His death and the benignity of His blessedness, those <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> immortals and hurtful wretches, and has prevented them from seducing to misery by their boast of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> those men whose hearts He has cleansed by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and whom He has thus freed from their impure dominion.</p>

<p>Man, then, mortal and miserable, and far removed from the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and the blessed, what medium shall he choose by which he may be united to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and blessedness? The <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, which might have some charm for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is miserable; the mortality of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which might offend man, exists no longer. In the one there is the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> misery; in the other, death, which could not be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, can no longer be feared, and blessedness, which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, must be loved. For the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and miserable mediator interposes himself to prevent us from passing to a blessed <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, because that which hinders such a passage, namely, misery, continues in him; but the mortal and blessed Mediator interposed Himself, in order that, having passed through mortality, He might of mortals make immortals (showing His power to do this in His own resurrection), and from being miserable to raise them to the blessed company from the number of whom He had Himself never departed. There is, then, a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> mediator, who separates friends, and a good Mediator, who reconciles enemies. And those who separate are numerous, because the multitude of the blessed are blessed only by their participation in the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; of which participation the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> being deprived, they are wretched, and interpose to hinder rather than to help to this blessedness, and by their very number prevent us from reaching that one beatific good, to obtain which we need not many but one Mediator, the uncreated <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, by whom all things were made, and in partaking of whom we are blessed. I do not say that He is Mediator because He is the Word, for as the Word He is supremely blessed and supremely <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and therefore far from miserable mortals; but He is Mediator as He is man, for by His humanity He shows us that, in order to obtain that blessed and beatific good, we need not seek other mediators to lead us through the successive steps of this attainment, but that the blessed and beatific <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having Himself become a partaker of our humanity, has afforded us ready access to the participation of His divinity. For in delivering us from our mortality and misery, He does not lead us to the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and blessed <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, so that we should become <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and blessed by participating in their nature, but He leads us straight to that Trinity, by participating in which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> themselves are blessed. Therefore, when He chose to be in the form of a servant, and lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, that He might be our Mediator, He remained higher than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;Himself at once the way of life on earth and life itself in heaven.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; Whether It is Reasonable in the Platonists to Determine that the Celestial Gods Decline Contact with Earthly Things and Intercourse with Men, Who Therefore Require the Intercession of the Demons.</h2>

<p>That opinion, which the same <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> avers that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> uttered, is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, <q>that no god holds intercourse with men.</q>  And this, he says, is the chief evidence of their exaltation, that they are never contaminated by contact with men. He admits, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are contaminated; and it follows that they cannot cleanse those by whom they are themselves contaminated, and thus all alike become impure, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by associating with men, and men by worshipping the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Or, if they say that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are not contaminated by associating and dealing with men, then they are better than the gods, for the gods, were they to do so, would be contaminated. For this, we are told, is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the gods, that they are so highly exalted that no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> intercourse can sully them. He affirms, indeed, that the supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator of all things, whom we call the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is spoken of by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> as the only God whom the poverty of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> speech fails even passably to describe; and that even the wise, when their mental energy is as far as  possible delivered from the trammels of connection with the body, have only such gleams of insight into His nature as may be compared to a flash of lightning illumining the darkness. If, then, this supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> exalted above all things, does nevertheless visit the minds of the wise, when emancipated from the body, with an intelligible and ineffable presence, though this be only occasional, and as it were a swift flash of light athwart the darkness, why are the other gods so sublimely removed from all contact with men, as if they would be polluted by it? As if it were not a sufficient refutation of this to lift up our eyes to those heavenly bodies which give the earth its needful light. If the stars, though they, by his account, are visible gods, are not contaminated when we look at them, neither are the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> contaminated when men see them quite closely. But perhaps it is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> voice, and not the eye, which pollutes the gods; and therefore the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are appointed to mediate and carry men's utterances to the gods, who keep themselves remote through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of pollution? What am I to say of the other senses? For by smell neither the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who are present, nor the gods, though they were present and inhaling the exhalations of living men, would be polluted if they are not contaminated with the effluvia of the carcasses offered in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. As for taste, they are pressed by no necessity of repairing bodily decay, so as to be reduced to ask food from men. And touch is in their own power. For while it may seem that contact is so called, because the sense of touch is specially concerned in it, yet the gods, if so minded, might mingle with men, so as to see and be seen, hear and be heard; and where is the need of touching? For men would not dare to desire this, if they were favored with the sight or conversation of gods or good <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; and if through excessive curiosity they should desire it, how could they accomplish their wish without the consent of the god or <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, when they cannot touch so much as a sparrow unless it be caged?</p>

<p>There is, then, nothing to hinder the gods from mingling in a bodily form with men, from seeing and being seen, from speaking and hearing. And if the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> do thus mix with men, as I said, and are not polluted, while the gods, were they to do so, should be polluted, then the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are less liable to pollution than the gods. And if even the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are contaminated, how can they help men to attain blessedness after death, if, so far from being able to cleanse them, and present them clean to the unpolluted gods, these mediators are themselves polluted? And if they cannot confer this benefit on men, what good can their friendly mediation do? Or shall its result be, not that men find entrance to the gods, but that men and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> abide together in a state of pollution, and consequently of exclusion from blessedness? Unless, perhaps, some one may say that, like sponges or things of that sort, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> themselves, in the process of cleansing their friends, become themselves the filthier in proportion as the others become clean. But if this is the solution, then the gods, who shun contact or intercourse with men for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of pollution, mix with <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who are far more polluted. Or perhaps the gods, who cannot cleanse men without polluting themselves, can without pollution cleanse the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who have been contaminated by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> contact? Who can <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> such follies, unless the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have practised their deceit upon him? If seeing and being seen is contamination, and if the gods, whom Apuleius himself calls visible, <q>the brilliant lights of the world,</q>  and the other stars, are seen by men, are we to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who cannot be seen unless they please, are safer from contamination? Or if it is only the seeing and not the being seen which contaminates, then they must deny that these gods of theirs, these brilliant lights of the world, see men when their rays beam upon the earth. Their rays are not contaminated by lighting on all manner of pollution, and are we to suppose that the gods would be contaminated if they mixed with men, and even if contact were needed in order to assist them? For there is contact between the earth and the sun's or moon's rays, and yet this does not pollute the light.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.&mdash; That to Obtain the Blessed Life, Which Consists in Partaking of the Supreme Good, Man Needs Such Mediation as is Furnished Not by a Demon, But by Christ Alone.</h2>

<p>I am considerably surprised that such learned men, men who pronounce all material and sensible things to be altogether inferior to those that are spiritual and intelligible, should mention bodily contact in connection with the blessed life. Is that sentiment of Plotinus forgotten?&mdash; <q>We must fly to our beloved fatherland. There is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, there our all. What fleet or flight shall convey us there? Our way is, to become like God.</q>  If, then, one is nearer to God the liker he is to Him, there is no other distance from God than unlikeness to Him. And the  <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man is unlike that incorporeal and unchangeable and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, in proportion as it craves things temporal and mutable. And as the things beneath, which are mortal and impure, cannot hold intercourse with the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> purity which is above, a mediator is indeed needed to remove this difficulty; but not a mediator who resembles the highest order of being by possessing an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> body, and the lowest by having a diseased <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which makes him rather grudge that we be healed than help our cure. We need a Mediator who, being united to us here below by the mortality of His body, should at the same time be able to afford us <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine help in cleansing and liberating us by means of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> righteousness of His spirit, whereby He remained heavenly even while here upon earth. Far be it from the incontaminable God to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> pollution from the man  He assumed, or from the men among whom He lived in the form of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For, though His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> showed us nothing else, these two wholesome facts were enough, that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> divinity cannot be polluted by flesh, and that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are not to be considered better than ourselves because they have not flesh.  This, then, as <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, is the <q>Mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the man Christ Jesus,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120357"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> of whose divinity, whereby He is equal to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and humanity, whereby He has become like us, this is not the place to speak as fully as I could.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; That the Deceitful Demons, While Promising to Conduct Men to God by Their Intercession, Mean to Turn Them from the Path of Truth.</h2>

<p>As to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, these false and deceitful mediators, who, though their uncleanness of spirit frequently reveals their misery and malignity, yet, by virtue of the levity of their aerial bodies and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the places they inhabit, do contrive to turn us aside and hinder our spiritual progress; they do not help us towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but rather prevent us from reaching Him. Since even in the bodily way, which is erroneous and misleading, and in which righteousness does not walk&mdash;for we must rise to God not by bodily ascent, but by incorporeal or spiritual conformity to Him&mdash;in this bodily way, I say, which the friends of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> arrange according to the weight of the various elements, the aerial <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> being set between the ethereal gods and earthy men, they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> the gods to have this privilege, that by this local interval they are preserved from the pollution of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> contact. Thus they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are contaminated by men rather than men cleansed by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and that the gods themselves should be polluted unless their local superiority preserved them. Who is so wretched a creature as to expect purification by a way in which men are contaminating, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> contaminated, and gods contaminable? Who would not rather choose that way whereby we escape the contamination of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and are cleansed from pollution by the incontaminable <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so as to be associated with the uncontaminated <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; That Even Among Their Own Worshippers the Name <q>Demon</q> Has Never a Good Signification.</h2>

<p>But as some of these demonolators, as I may call them, and among them Labeo, allege that those whom they call <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are by others called <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, I must, if I would not seem to dispute merely about words, say something about the good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. The Platonists do not deny their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but prefer to call them good <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. But we, following Scripture, according to which we are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, have learned that some of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are good, some bad, but never have we read in Scripture of good <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; but wherever this or any cognate term occurs, it is applied only to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits. And this usage has become so universal, that, even among those who are called <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, and who maintain that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> as well as gods should be worshipped, there is scarcely a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, no matter how well read and learned, who would dare to say by way of praise to his slave, You have a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, or who could <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the man to whom he said this would consider it a curse? Why, then, are we to subject ourselves to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of explaining away what we have said when we have given offense by using the word <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, with which every one, or almost every one, connects a bad meaning, while we can so easily evade this necessity by using the word <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; Of the Kind of Knowledge Which Puffs Up the Demons.</h2>

<p>However, the very origin of the name suggests something worthy of consideration, if we compare it with the divine books. They are called <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> from a Greek word meaning <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.  Now the apostle, speaking with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, says, <q>Knowledge puffs up, but charity builds up.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120359"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:1</a></span> And this  can only be understood as meaning that without charity <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does no good, but inflates a man or magnifies him with an empty windiness. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, then, have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> without charity, and are thereby so inflated or <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, that they crave those divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> and religious services which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be due to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and still, as far as they can, exact these from all over whom they have influence. Against this <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, under which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> was held subject as its merited punishment, there was exerted the mighty influence of the humility of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who appeared in the form of a servant; but men, resembling the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, but not in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and being puffed up with uncleanness, failed to recognize Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.&mdash; To What Extent the Lord Was Pleased to Make Himself Known to the Demons.</h2>

<p>The devils themselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this manifestation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so well, that they said to the Lord though clothed with the infirmity of flesh, <q>What have we to do with You, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>? Have You come to destroy us before the time?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120360"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse24">Mark&nbsp;1:24</a></span> From these words, it is clear that they had great <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and no charity. They feared His power to punish, and did not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> His righteousness. He made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them so much as He pleased, and He was pleased to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> so much as was needful. But He made Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> not as to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him as the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, which they partake, but as was requisite to strike with terror the beings from whose tyranny He was going to free those who were <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> to His kingdom and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of it, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. He made Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, therefore, to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, not by that which is life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and the unchangeable light which illumines the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are cleansed by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that is in Him, but by some temporal effects of His power, and evidences of His <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> presence, which were more easily discerned by the angelic senses even of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits than by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity. But when He judged it advisable gradually to suppress these signs, and to retire into deeper obscurity, the prince of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether He were the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and endeavored to ascertain this by tempting Him, in so far as He permitted Himself to be tempted, that He might adapt the manhood He wore to be an example for our imitation. But after that <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, when, as <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, He was ministered to <span class="stiki" id="note120361"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;4:3-11</a></span> by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are good and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and therefore objects of terror to the impure spirits, He revealed more and more distinctly to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> how great He was, so that, even though the infirmity of His flesh might seem contemptible, none dared to resist His authority.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; The Difference Between the Knowledge of the Holy Angels and that of the Demons.</h2>

<p>The good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, therefore, hold cheap all that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of material and transitory things which the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are so <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of possessing,&mdash; not that they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of these things, but because the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby they are sanctified, is very dear to them, and because, in comparison of that not merely immaterial but also unchangeable and ineffable beauty, with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of which they are inflamed, they despise all things which are beneath it, and all that is not it, that they may with every good thing that is in them enjoy that good which is the source of their goodness. And therefore they have a more certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> even of those temporal and mutable things, because they contemplate their principles and causes in the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which the world was made&mdash;those causes by which one thing is, approved, another rejected, and all arranged. But the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> do not behold in the wisdom of God these <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and, as it were, cardinal causes of things temporal, but only foresee a larger part of the future than men do, by reason of their greater acquaintance with the signs which are hidden from us. Sometimes, too, it is their own intentions they predict. And, finally, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are frequently, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> never, deceived. For it is one thing, by the aid of things temporal and changeable, to conjecture the changes that may occur in time, and to modify such things by one's own will and faculty&mdash;and this is to a certain extent permitted to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>&mdash;it is another thing to foresee the changes of times in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and immutable <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which live in His wisdom, and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the most infallible and powerful of all causes, by participating in His spirit; and this is granted to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> discretion. And thus they are not only <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, but blessed. And the good wherein they are blessed is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whom they were created. For without end they enjoy the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and participation of Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.&mdash; That the Name of Gods is Falsely Given to the Gods of the Gentiles, Though Scripture Applies It Both to the Holy Angels and Just Men.</h2>

<p>If the Platonists prefer to call these <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> gods rather than <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and to reckon them with those whom <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, their founder and master, maintains were created by the supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  they are welcome to do so, for I will not spend strength in fighting about words. For if they say that these beings are <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and yet created by the supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, blessed but by cleaving to their Creator and not by their own power, they say what we say, whatever name they call these beings by. And that this is the opinion either of all or the best of the Platonists can be ascertained by their writings. And regarding the name itself, if they see fit to call such blessed and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> creatures gods, this need not give rise to any serious discussion between us, since in our own Scriptures we read, <q>The God of gods, the Lord has spoken;</q>  and again, <q>Confess to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of gods;</q>  and again, <q>He is a great King above all gods.</q>  And where it is said, <q>He is to be feared above all gods,</q> the reason is immediately added, for it follows, <q>for all the gods of the nations are <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, but the Lord made the heavens.</q>  He said, <q>above all gods,</q> but added, <q>of the nations;</q> that is to say, above all those whom the nations count gods, in other words, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. By them He is to be feared with that terror in which they cried to the Lord, <q>Have You come to destroy us?</q> But where it is said, <q>the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of gods,</q> it cannot be understood as the god of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; and far be it from us to say that <q>great King above all gods</q> means <q>great King above all <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</q> But the same Scripture also calls men who belong to God's people <q>gods:</q> <q>I have said, You are gods, and all of you children of the Most High.</q>  Accordingly, when God is styled God of gods, this may be understood of these gods; and so, too, when He is styled a great King above all gods.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Nevertheless, some one may say, if men are called gods because they belong to God's people, whom He addresses by means of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, are not the immortals, who already enjoy that felicity which men seek to attain by worshipping <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, much more worthy of the title? And what shall we reply to this, if not that it is not without reason that in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture men are more expressly styled gods than those <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and blessed spirits to whom we hope to be equal in the resurrection, because there was a <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that the weakness of unbelief, being overcome with the excellence of these beings, might presume to constitute some of them a god? In the case of men this was a result that need not be guarded against. Besides, it was right that the men belonging to God's people should be more expressly called gods, to assure and certify them that He who is called God of gods is their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because, although those <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and blessed spirits who dwell in the heavens are called gods, yet they are not called gods of gods, that is to say, gods of the men who constitute God's people, and to whom it is said, <q>I have said, You are gods, and all of you the children of the Most High.</q> Hence the saying of the apostle, <q>Though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, as there be gods many and lords many, but to us there is but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of whom are all things, and we in Him; and one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom are all things, and we by Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120368"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:5-6</a></span> </p>

<p>We need not, therefore, laboriously contend about the name, since the reality is so obvious as to admit of no shadow of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. That which we say, that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are sent to announce the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to men belong to the order of blessed immortals, does not satisfy the Platonists, because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that this ministry is discharged, not by those whom they call gods, in other words, not by blessed immortals, but by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, whom they dare not affirm to be blessed, but only <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, or if they do rank them among the blessed immortals, yet only as good <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and not as gods who dwell in the heaven of heavens remote from all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> contact. But, though it may seem mere wrangling about a name, yet the name of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> is so detestable that we cannot bear in any sense to apply it to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Now, therefore, let us close this book in the assurance that, whatever we call these <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and blessed spirits, who yet are only creatures, they do not act as mediators to introduce to everlasting felicity miserable mortals, from whom they are severed by a twofold distinction. And those others who are mediators, in so far as they have <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> in common with their superiors, and misery in common with their inferiors (for they are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> miserable in punishment of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>), cannot bestow upon us, but rather grudge that we should possess, the blessedness from which they themselves are excluded. And so the friends of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have nothing considerable to allege why we should rather worship them as  our helpers than avoid them as traitors to our interests. As for those spirits who are good, and who are therefore not only <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> but also blessed, and to whom they suppose we should give the title of gods, and offer worship and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for the sake of inheriting a future life, we shall, by God's help, endeavor in the following book to show that these spirits, call them by what name, and ascribe to them what nature you will, desire that religious worship be paid to God alone, by whom they were created, and by whose communications of Himself to them they are blessed.</p>
