<h1>The City of God (Book V)</h1>

<p class="h1a">Augustine first discusses the doctrine of fate, for the sake of confuting those who are disposed to refer to fate the power and increase of the Roman empire, which could not be attributed to false gods, as has been shown in the preceding book. After that, he proves that there is no contradiction between God's prescience and our free will. He then speaks of the manners of the ancient Romans, and shows in what sense it was due to the virtue of the Romans themselves, and in how far to the counsel of God, that he increased their dominion, though they did not worship him. Finally, he explains what is to be accounted the true happiness of the Christian emperors.</p>

<h2>Preface.</h2>

<p>Since, then, it is established that the complete attainment of all we desire is that which constitutes felicity, which is no goddess, but a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that therefore men can worship no god save Him who is able to make them <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>&mdash;and were Felicity herself a goddess, she would with reason be the only object of worship,&mdash; since, I say, this is established, let us now go on to consider why <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is able to give with all other things those good gifts which can be possessed by men who are not good, and consequently not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, has seen fit to grant such extended and long-continued dominion to the Roman empire; for that this was not effected by that multitude of false gods which they worshipped, we have both already adduced, and shall, as occasion offers, yet adduce considerable <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; That the Cause of the Roman Empire, and of All Kingdoms, is Neither Fortuitous Nor Consists in the Position of the Stars.</h2> 

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, then, of the greatness of the Roman empire is neither fortuitous nor fatal, according to the judgment or opinion of those who call those things <em> fortuitous</em> which either have no causes, or such causes as do not proceed from some intelligible order, and those things <em> fatal</em> which happen independently of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man, by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of a certain <em>order</em>. In a word, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> kingdoms are established by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>. And if any one attributes their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> to <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, because he calls the will or the power of God itself by the name of <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, let him keep his opinion, but correct his language. For why does he not say at first what he will say afterwards, when some one shall put the question to him, What he means by <em><a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a></em>? For when men hear that word, according to the ordinary use of the language, they simply understand by it the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of that particular position of the stars which may exist at the time when any one is born or conceived, which some separate altogether from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while others affirm that this also is dependent on that will. But those who are of opinion that, apart from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the stars determine what we shall do, or what <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things we shall possess, or what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> we shall suffer, must be refused a hearing by all, not only by those who hold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, but by those who wish to be the worshippers of any gods whatsoever, even false gods. For what does this opinion really amount to but this, that no god whatever is to be worshipped or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>  to? Against these, however, our present disputation is not intended to be directed, but against those who, in defence of those whom they think to be gods, oppose the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. They, however, who make the position of the stars depend on the divine will, and in a manner decree what character each man shall have, and what good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> shall happen to him, if they think that these same stars have that power conferred upon them by the supreme power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that they may determine these things according to their will, do a great injury to the celestial sphere, in whose most brilliant senate, and most splendid senate-house, as it were, they suppose that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are decreed to be done&mdash;such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> as that, if any terrestrial state should decree them, it would be condemned to overthrow by the decree of the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. &nbsp;What judgment, then, is left to God concerning the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who is Lord both of the stars and of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, when to these <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> a celestial necessity is attributed? Or, if they do not say that the stars, though they have indeed received a certain power from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is supreme, determine those things according to their own discretion, but simply that His commands are fulfilled by them instrumentally in the application and enforcing of such necessities, are we thus to think concerning God even what it seemed unworthy that we should think concerning the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the stars? But, if the stars are said rather to signify these things than to effect them, so that that <em>position of the stars</em> is, as it were, a kind of speech predicting, not causing future things&mdash;for this has been the opinion of men of no ordinary learning&mdash;certainly the mathematicians are not wont so to speak saying, for example, Mars in such or such a position <em> signifies</em> a homicide, but <em>makes</em> a homicide. But, nevertheless, though we grant that they do not speak as they ought, and that we ought to accept as the proper form of speech that employed by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> in predicting those things which they think they discover in the position of the stars, how comes it that they have never been able to assign any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why, in the life of twins, in their actions, in the events which befall them, in their professions, arts, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, and other things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, also in their very death, there is often so great a difference, that, as far as these things are concerned, many entire strangers are more like them than they are like each other, though separated at birth by the smallest interval of time, but at conception generated by the same act of copulation, and at the same moment?</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; On the Difference in the Health of Twins.</h2>

<p>Cicero says that the famous physician Hippocrates has left in writing that he had suspected that a certain pair of brothers were twins, from the fact that they both took ill at once, and their disease advanced to its crisis and subsided in the same time in each of them.  Posidonius the Stoic, who was much given to <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>, used to explain the fact by supposing that they had been born and conceived under the same constellation. In this question the conjecture of the physician is by far more worthy to be accepted, and approaches much nearer to credibility, since, according as the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were affected in body at the time of copulation, so might the first elements of the f&oelig;tuses have been affected, so that all that was necessary for their growth and development up till birth having been supplied from the body of the same mother, they might be born with like constitutions. Thereafter, nourished in the same house, on the same kinds of food, where they would have also the same kinds of air, the same locality, the same quality of water&mdash;which, according to the testimony of medical science, have a very great influence, good or bad, on the condition of bodily health&mdash;and where they would also be accustomed to the same kinds of exercise, they would have bodily constitutions so similar that they would be similarly affected with sickness at the same time and by the same causes. But, to wish to adduce that particular position of the stars which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> at the time when they were born or conceived as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their being simultaneously affected with sickness, manifests the greatest arrogance, when so many beings of most diverse kinds, in the most diverse conditions, and subject to the most diverse events, may have been conceived and born at the same time, and in the same district, lying under the same sky. But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that twins do not only act differently, and travel to very different places, but that they also suffer from different kinds of sickness; for which Hippocrates would give what is in my opinion the simplest reason, namely, that, through diversity of food and exercise, which arises not from the constitution of the body, but from the inclination of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, they may have come to be different from each other in respect of health. Moreover, Posidonius, or any other asserter of the fatal influence of the stars, will have enough to do to find anything to say to this, if he be unwilling to im  pose upon the minds of the uninstructed in things of which they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. But, as to what they attempt to make out from that very small interval of time elapsing between the births of twins, on account of that point in the heavens where the mark of the natal hour is placed, and which they call the <q>horoscope,</q> it is either disproportionately small to the diversity which is found in the dispositions, actions, habits, and fortunes of twins, or it is disproportionately great when compared with the estate of twins, whether low or high, which is the same for both of them, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for whose greatest difference they place, in every case, in the hour on which one is born; and, for this reason, if the one is born so immediately after the other that there is no change in the horoscope, I demand an entire similarity in all that respects them both, which can never be found in the case of any twins. But if the slowness of the birth of the second give time for a change in the horoscope, I demand different <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, which twins can never have.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; Concerning the Arguments Which Nigidius the Mathematician Drew from the Potter's Wheel, in the Question About the Birth of Twins.</h2>

<p>It is to no purpose, therefore, that that famous fiction about the potter's wheel is brought forward, which tells of the answer which Nigidius is said to have given when he was perplexed with this question, and on account of which he was called <em>Figulus</em>.  For, having whirled round the potter's wheel with all his strength he marked it with ink, striking it twice with the utmost rapidity, so that the strokes seemed to fall on the very same part of it. Then, when the rotation had ceased, the marks which he had made were found upon the rim of the wheel at no small distance apart. Thus, said he, considering the great rapidity with which the celestial sphere revolves, even though twins were born with as short an interval between their births as there was between the strokes which I gave this wheel, that brief interval of time is equivalent to a very great distance in the celestial sphere. Hence, said he, come whatever dissimilitudes may be remarked in the habits and fortunes of twins. This argument is more fragile than the vessels which are fashioned by the rotation of that wheel. For if there is so much significance in the heavens which cannot be comprehended by observation of the constellations, that, in the case of twins, an inheritance may fall to the one and not to the other, why, in the case of others who are not twins, do they dare, having examined their constellations, to declare such things as pertain to that secret which no one can comprehend, and to attribute them to the precise moment of the birth of each individual? Now, if such predictions in connection with the natal hours of others who are not twins are to be vindicated on the ground that they are founded on the observation of more extended spaces in the heavens, while those very small moments of time which separated the births of twins, and correspond to minute portions of celestial space, are to be connected with trifling things about which the mathematicians are not wont to be consulted&mdash;for who would consult them as to when he is to sit, when to walk abroad, when and on what he is to dine? &mdash; how can we be justified in so speaking, when we can point out such manifold diversity both in the habits, doings, and destinies of twins?</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; Concerning the Twins Esau and Jacob, Who Were Very Unlike Each Other Both in Their Character and Actions.</h2>

<p>In the time of the ancient fathers, to speak concerning illustrious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, there were born two twin brothers, the one so immediately after the other, that the first took hold of the heel of the second. So great a difference <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in their lives and manners, so great a dissimilarity in their actions, so great a difference in their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for them respectively, that the very contrast between them produced even a mutual hostile antipathy. Do we mean, when we say that they were so unlike each other, that when the one was walking the other was sitting, when the one was sleeping the other was waking&mdash;which differences are such as are attributed to those minute portions of space which cannot be appreciated by those who note down the position of the stars which exists at the moment of one's birth, in order that the mathematicians may be consulted concerning it? One of these twins was for a long time a hired servant; the other never served. One of them was beloved by his mother; the other was not so. One of them lost that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which was so much valued among their people; the other obtained it. And what shall we say of their wives, their children, and their possessions? How different they were in respect to all these! If, therefore, such things as these are connected with those minute intervals of time which elapse between the births of twins, and are not to be attributed to the constellations, wherefore are they predicted in the case of  others from the examination of their constellations? And if, on the other hand, these things are said to be predicted, because they are connected, not with minute and inappreciable moments, but with intervals of time which can be observed and noted down, what purpose is that potter's wheel to serve in this matter, except it be to whirl round men who have hearts of clay, in order that they may be prevented from detecting the emptiness of the talk of the mathematicians?</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; In What Manner the Mathematicians are Convicted of Professing a Vain Science.</h2>

<p>Do not those very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom the medical sagacity of Hippocrates led him to suspect to be twins, because their disease was observed by him to develop to its crisis and to subside again in the same time in each of them&mdash;do not these, I say, serve as a sufficient refutation of those who wish to attribute to the influence of the stars that which was owing to a similarity of bodily constitution? For wherefore were they both sick of the same disease, and at the same time, and not the one after the other in the order of their birth? (for certainly they could not both be born at the same time.) Or, if the fact of their having been born at different times by no means necessarily implies that they must be sick at different times, why do they contend that the difference in the time of their births was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their difference in other things? Why could they travel in foreign parts at different times, marry at different times, beget children at different times, and do many other things at different times, by reason of their having been born at different times, and yet could not, for the same reason, also be sick at different times? For if a difference in the moment of birth changed the horoscope, and occasioned dissimilarity in all other things, why has that simultaneousness which belonged to their conception remained in their attacks of sickness? Or, if the destinies of health are involved in the time of conception, but those of other things be said to be attached to the time of birth, they ought not to predict anything concerning health from examination of the constellations of birth, when the hour of conception is not also given, that its constellations may be inspected. But if they say that they predict attacks of sickness without examining the horoscope of conception, because these are indicated by the moments of birth, how could they inform either of these twins when he would be sick, from the horoscope of his birth, when the other also, who had not the same horoscope of birth, must of necessity fall sick at the same time? Again, I ask, if the distance of time between the births of twins is so great as to occasion a difference of their constellations on account of the difference of their horoscopes, and therefore of all the cardinal points to which so much influence is attributed, that even from such change there comes a difference of destiny, how is it possible that this should be so, since they cannot have been conceived at different times? Or, if two conceived at the same moment of time could have different destinies with respect to their births, why may not also two born at the same moment of time have different destinies for life and for death? For if the one moment in which both were conceived did not hinder that the one should be born before the other, why, if two are born at the same moment, should anything hinder them from dying at the same moment? If a simultaneous conception allows of twins being differently affected in the <em>womb</em>, why should not simultaneousness of birth allow of any two individuals having different fortunes in the <em> world</em>? And thus would all the fictions of this art, or rather delusion, be swept away. What strange circumstance is this, that two children conceived at the same time, nay, at the same moment, under the same position of the stars, have different fates which bring them to different hours of birth, while two children, born of two different mothers, at the same moment of time, under one and the same position of the stars, cannot have different fates which shall conduct them by necessity to diverse manners of life and of death? Are they at conception as yet without destinies, because they can only have them if they be born? What, therefore, do they mean when they say that, if the hour of the conception be found, many things can be predicted by these astrologers? From which also arose that story which is reiterated by some, that a certain sage chose an hour in which to lie with his wife, in order to secure his begetting an illustrious son. From this opinion also came that answer of Posidonius, the great astrologer and also <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, concerning those twins who were attacked with sickness at the same time, namely, <q>That this had happened to them because they were conceived at the same time, and <em>born</em> at the same time.</q> For certainly he added <q>conception,</q> lest it should be said to him that they could not both be born at the same time, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that at any rate they must both have been conceived at the same time; wishing thus to show that he did not attribute the fact of their being similarly and simultaneously affected with sickness  to the similarity of their bodily constitutions as its proximate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but that he held that even in respect of the similarity of their health, they were bound together by a sidereal connection. If, therefore, the time of conception has so much to do with the similarity of destinies, these same destinies ought not to be changed by the circumstances of birth; or, if the destinies of twins be said to be changed because they are born at different times, why should we not rather understand that they had been already changed in order that they might be born at different times? Does not, then, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of men living in the world change the destinies of birth, when the order of birth can change the destinies they had at conception?</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; Concerning Twins of Different Sexes.</h2>

<p>But even in the very conception of twins, which certainly occurs at the same moment in the case of both, it often happens that the one is conceived a male, and the other a female. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> two of different sexes who are twins. Both of them are alive, and in the flower of their age; and though they resemble each other in body, as far as difference of sex will permit, still they are very different in the whole scope and purpose of their lives (consideration being had of those differences which necessarily exist between the lives of males and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>)&mdash;the one holding the office of a count, and being almost constantly away from home with the army in foreign service, the other never leaving her country's soil, or her native district. Still more&mdash;and this is more incredible, if the destinies of the stars are to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in, though it is not wonderful if we consider the wills of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the free gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;he is married; she is a sacred virgin: he has begotten a numerous offspring; she has never even married. But is not the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the horoscope very great? I think I have said enough to show the absurdity of that. But, say those astrologers, whatever be the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the horoscope in other respects, it is certainly of significance with respect to birth. But why not also with respect to conception, which takes place undoubtedly with one act of copulation? And, indeed, so great is the force of nature, that after a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has once conceived, she ceases to be liable to conception. Or were they, perhaps, changed at birth, either he into a male, or she into a female, because of the difference in their horoscopes? But, while it is not altogether absurd to say that certain sidereal influences have some power to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> differences in bodies alone&mdash;as, for instance, we see that the seasons of the year come round by the approaching and receding of the sun, and that certain kinds of things are increased in size or diminished by the waxings and wanings of the moon, such as sea-urchins, oysters, and the wonderful tides of the ocean&mdash;it does not follow that the <em>wills of men</em> are to be made subject to the position of the stars. The astrologers, however, when they wish to bind our actions also to the constellations, only set us on investigating whether, even in these bodies, the changes may not be attributable to some other than a sidereal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For what is there which more intimately concerns a body than its sex? And yet, under the same position of the stars, twins of different sexes may be conceived. Wherefore, what greater absurdity can be affirmed or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> than that the position of the stars, which was the same for both of them at the time of conception, could not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that the one child should not have been of a different sex from her brother, with whom she had a common constellation, while the position of the stars which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> at the hour of their birth could <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that she should be separated from him by the great distance between marriage and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; Concerning the Choosing of a Day for Marriage, or for Planting, or Sowing.</h2>

<p>Now, will any one bring forward this, that in choosing certain particular days for particular actions, men bring about certain new destinies for their actions? That man, for instance, according to this doctrine, was not born to have an illustrious son, but rather a contemptible one, and therefore, being a man of learning, he choose an hour in which to lie with his wife. He made, therefore, a destiny which he did not have before, and from that destiny of his own making something began to be fatal which was not contained in the destiny of his natal hour. Oh, singular stupidity! A day is chosen on which to marry; and for this reason, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that unless a day be chosen, the marriage may fall on an unlucky day, and turn out an unhappy one. What then becomes of what the stars have already decreed at the hour of birth? Can a man be said to change by an act of choice that which has already been determined for him, while that which he himself has determined in the choosing of a day cannot be changed by another power? Thus, if men alone, and not all things under heaven, are subject to the influence of the stars, why do  they choose some days as suitable for planting vines or trees, or for sowing grain, other days as suitable for taming beasts on, or for putting the males to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>, that the cows and mares may be impregnated, and for such-like things? If it be said that certain chosen days have an influence on these things, because the constellations rule over all terrestrial bodies, animate and inanimate, according to differences in moments of time, let it be considered what innumerable multitudes of beings are born or arise, or take their origin at the very same instant of time, which come to ends so different, that they may persuade any little boy that these observations about days are ridiculous. For who is so mad as to dare affirm that all trees, all herbs, all beasts, serpents, birds, fishes, worms, have each separately their own moments of birth or commencement? Nevertheless, men are wont, in order to try the skill of the mathematicians, to bring before them the constellations of dumb animals, the constellations of whose birth they diligently observe at home with a view to this discovery; and they prefer those mathematicians to all others, who say from the inspection of the constellations that they indicate the birth of a beast and not of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. They also dare tell what kind of beast it is, whether it is a wool-bearing beast, or a beast suited for carrying burthens, or one fit for the plough, or for watching a house; for the astrologers are also tried with respect to the fates of dogs, and their answers concerning these are followed by shouts of admiration on the part of those who consult them. They so deceive men as to make them think that during the birth of a man the births of all other beings are suspended, so that not even a fly comes to life at the same time that he is being born, under the same region of the heavens. And if this be admitted with respect to the fly, the reasoning cannot stop there, but must ascend from flies till it lead them up to camels and elephants. Nor are they willing to attend to this, that when a day has been chosen whereon to sow a field, so many grains fall into the ground simultaneously, germinate simultaneously, spring up, come to perfection, and ripen simultaneously; and yet, of all the ears which are coeval, and, so to speak, <em>congerminal</em>, some are destroyed by mildew, some are devoured by the birds, and some are pulled by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. How can they say that all these had their different constellations, which they see coming to so different ends? Will they confess that it is folly to choose days for such things, and to affirm that they do not come within the sphere of the celestial decree, while they subject men alone to the stars, on whom alone in the world God has bestowed free wills? All these things being considered, we have good reason to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, when the astrologers give very many wonderful answers, it is to be attributed to the occult inspiration of spirits not of the best kind, whose care it is to insinuate into the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and to confirm in them, those false and noxious opinions concerning the fatal influence of the stars, and not to their marking and inspecting of horoscopes, according to some kind of art which in reality has no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; Concerning Those Who Call by the Name of Fate, Not the Position of the Stars, But the Connection of Causes Which Depends on the Will of God.</h2>

<p>But, as to those who call by the name of <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, not the disposition of the stars as it may exist when any creature is conceived, or born, or commences its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but the whole connection and train of causes which makes everything become what it does become, there is no need that I should labor and strive with them in a merely verbal controversy, since they attribute the so-called order and connection of causes to the will and power of God most high, who is most rightly and most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things before they come to pass, and to leave nothing unordained; from whom are all powers, although the wills of all are not from Him. Now, that it is chiefly the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> most high, whose power extends itself irresistibly through all things which they call <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the following verses, of which, if I mistake not, Ann&aelig;us Seneca is the author:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p>Father supreme, You ruler of the lofty heavens,<br>
Lead me where'er it is Your pleasure; I will give<br>
A prompt <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, making no delay,<br>
Lo! Here I am. Promptly I come to do Your sovereign will;<br>
If your command shall thwart my inclination, I will still<br>
Follow You groaning, and the work assigned,<br>
With all the suffering of a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> repugnant,<br>
Will perform, being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; which, had I been good,<br>
I should have undertaken and performed, though hard,<br>
With <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> cheerfulness.<br>
The Fates do lead the man that follows willing;<br>
But the man that is unwilling, him they drag. </p></blockquote>

<p>Most evidently, in this last verse, he calls that <q><a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a></q> which he had before called <q>the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father supreme,</q> whom, he says, he is ready to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> that he may be led, being willing, not dragged, being unwilling, since <q>the Fates do lead the man that follows willing, but the man that is unwilling, him they drag.</q></p> 

<p>The following Homeric lines, which Cicero translates into Latin, also favor this opinion:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p>Such are the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as is the light<br>
Which Father Jove himself does pour<br>
Illustrious o'er the fruitful earth. </p></blockquote>

<p>Not that Cicero wishes that a poetical sentiment should have any weight in a question like this; for when he says that the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, when asserting the power of <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, were in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of using these verses from Homer, he is not treating concerning the opinion of that poet, but concerning that of those <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, since by these verses, which they quote in connection with the controversy which they hold about <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, is most distinctly manifested what it is which they reckon <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, since they call by the name of Jupiter him whom they reckon the supreme god, from whom, they say, hangs the whole chain of fates.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; Concerning the Foreknowledge of God and the Free Will of Man, in Opposition to the Definition of Cicero.</h2>

<p>The manner in which Cicero addresses himself to the task of refuting the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, shows that he did not think he could effect anything against them in argument unless he had first demolished <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>.  And this he attempts to accomplish by denying that there is any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of future things, and maintains with all his might that there is no such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> either in God or man, and that there is no prediction of events. Thus he both denies the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and attempts by vain arguments, and by opposing to himself certain oracles very easy to be refuted, to overthrow all <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, even such as is clearer than the light (though even these oracles are not refuted by him).</p>

<p>But, in refuting these conjectures of the mathematicians, his argument is triumphant, because <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> these are such as destroy and refute themselves. Nevertheless, they are far more tolerable who assert the fatal influence of the stars than they who deny the foreknowledge of future events. For, to confess that God exists, and at the same time to deny that He has foreknowledge of future things, is the most manifest folly. This Cicero himself saw, and therefore attempted to assert the doctrine embodied in the words of Scripture, <q>The fool has said in his heart, There is no God.</q>  That, however, he did not do in his own person, for he saw how odious and offensive such an opinion would be; and therefore, in his book on the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the gods,  he makes Cotta dispute concerning this against the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, and preferred to give his own opinion in favor of Lucilius Balbus, to whom he assigned the defence of the Stoical position, rather than in favor of Cotta, who maintained that no divinity exists. However, in his book on <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>, he in his own person most openly opposes the doctrine of the prescience of future things. But all this he seems to do in order that he may not grant the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, and by so doing destroy <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. For he thinks that, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of future things being once conceded, <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> follows as so necessary a consequence that it cannot be denied.</p>

<p>But, let these perplexing debatings and disputations of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> go on as they may, we, in order that we may confess the most high and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God Himself, do confess His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, supreme power, and prescience. Neither let us be afraid lest, after all, we do not do by will that which we do by will, because He, whose foreknowledge is infallible, foreknew that we would do it. It was this which Cicero was afraid of, and therefore opposed foreknowledge. The <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> also maintained that all things do not come to pass by necessity, although they contended that all things happen according to destiny. What is it, then, that Cicero feared in the prescience of future things? Doubtless it was this&mdash;that if all future things have been foreknown, they will happen in the order in which they have been foreknown; and if they come to pass in this order, there is a certain order of things foreknown by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and if a certain order of things, then a certain order of causes, for nothing can happen which is not preceded by some efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But if there is a certain order of causes according to which everything happens which does happen, then by <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, says he, all things happen which do happen. But if this be so, then is there nothing in our own power, and there is no such thing as freedom of will; and if we grant that, says he, the whole economy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life is subverted. In vain are <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> enacted. In vain are reproaches, praises, chidings, exhortations had recourse to; and there is no <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> whatever in the appointment of rewards for the good, and punishments for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. And that consequences so disgraceful, and absurd, and pernicious to humanity may not follow, Cicero chooses to reject the foreknowledge of future things, and shuts up the religious mind to this alternative, to make choice between two things, either that something is in our own power, or that there is foreknowledge&mdash;both of which cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but if the one is affirmed, the other is thereby denied. He therefore, like a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> great and wise man, and one who consulted very much and very  skillfully for the good of humanity, of those two chose the freedom of the will, to confirm which he denied the foreknowledge of future things; and thus, wishing to make men free he makes them <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a>. But the religious mind chooses both, confesses both, and maintains both by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. But how so? Says Cicero; for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of future things being granted, there follows a chain of consequences which ends in this, that there can be nothing depending on our own free wills. And further, if there is anything depending on our wills, we must go backwards by the same steps of reasoning till we arrive at the conclusion that there is no foreknowledge of future things. For we go backwards through all the steps in the following order:&mdash; If there is <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, all things do not happen according to <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>; if all things do not happen according to <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, there is not a certain order of causes; and if there is not a certain order of causes, neither is there a certain order of things foreknown by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;for things cannot come to pass except they are preceded by efficient causes,&mdash; but, if there is no fixed and certain order of causes foreknown by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all things cannot be said to happen according as He foreknew that they would happen. And further, if it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that all things happen just as they have been foreknown by Him, there is not, says he, in God any foreknowledge of future events.</p>

<p>Now, against the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> and impious darings of reason, we assert both that God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things before they come to pass, and that we do by our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> whatsoever we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and feel to be done by us only because we will it. But that all things come to pass by <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, we do not say; nay we affirm that nothing comes to pass by <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>; for we demonstrate that the name of <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, as it is wont to be used by those who speak of <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, meaning thereby the position of the stars at the time of each one's conception or birth, is an unmeaning word, for <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a> itself is a delusion. But an order of causes in which the highest efficiency is attributed to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we neither deny nor do we designate it by the name of <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, unless, perhaps, we may understand <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> to mean that which is spoken, deriving it from <em>fari</em>, to speak; for we cannot deny that it is written in the sacred Scriptures, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has spoken once; these two things have I heard, that power belongs unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Also unto You, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, belongs mercy: for You will render unto every man according to his works.</q>  Now the expression, <q>Once has He spoken,</q> is to be understood as meaning <q> <em>immovably</em>,</q> that is, unchangeably has He spoken, inasmuch as He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> unchangeably all things which shall be, and all things which He will do. We might, then, use the word <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> in the sense it bears when derived from <em>fari</em>, to speak, had it not already come to be understood in another sense, into which I am unwilling that the hearts of men should unconsciously slide. But it does not follow that, though there is for God a certain order of all causes, there must therefore be nothing depending on the free exercise of our own wills, for our wills themselves are included in that order of causes which is certain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is embraced by His foreknowledge, for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wills are also causes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> actions; and He who foreknew all the causes of things would certainly among those causes not have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of our wills. For even that very concession which Cicero himself makes is enough to refute him in this argument. For what does it help him to say that nothing takes place without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but that every <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not fatal, there being a fortuitous <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, a natural <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>? It is sufficient that he confesses that whatever happens must be preceded by a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For we say that those causes which are called fortuitous are not a mere name for the absence of causes, but are only latent, and we attribute them either to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or to that of spirits of some kind or other. And as to natural causes, we by no means separate them from the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him who is the author and framer of all nature. But now as to <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> causes. They are referable either to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or to animals of whatever description, if indeed those instinctive movements of animals devoid of reason, by which, in accordance with their own nature, they seek or shun various things, are to be called wills. And when I speak of the wills of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, I mean either the wills of good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, whom we call the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, whom we call the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Also by the wills of men I mean the wills either of the good or of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. And from this we conclude that there are no efficient causes of all things which come to pass unless <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> causes, that is, such as belong to that nature which is the spirit of life. For the air or wind is called spirit, but, inasmuch as it is a body, it is not the spirit of life. The spirit of life, therefore, which quickens all things, and is the creator of every body, and of every created spirit, is God Himself, the uncreated spirit. In His supreme will resides the power  which acts on the wills of all created spirits, helping the good, judging the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, controlling all, granting power to some, not granting it to others. For, as He is the creator of all natures, so also is He the bestower of all powers, not of all wills; for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> wills are not from Him, being contrary to nature, which is from Him. As to bodies, they are more subject to wills: some to our wills, by which I mean the wills of all living mortal creatures, but more to the wills of men than of beasts. But all of them are most of all subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom all wills also are subject, since they have no power except what He has bestowed upon them. The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of things, therefore, which makes but is made, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but all other causes both make and are made. Such are all created spirits, and especially the rational. Material causes, therefore, which may rather be said to be made than to make, are not to be reckoned among efficient causes, because they can only do what the wills of spirits do by them. How, then, does an order of causes which is certain to the foreknowledge of God necessitate that there should be nothing which is dependent on our wills, when our wills themselves have a very important place in the order of causes? Cicero, then, contends with those who call this order of causes fatal, or rather designate this order itself by the name of <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>; to which we have an abhorrence, especially on account of the word, which men have become accustomed to understand as meaning what is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But, whereas he denies that the order of all causes is most certain, and perfectly clear to the prescience of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we detest his opinion more than the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> do. For he either denies that God exists,&mdash; which, indeed, in an assumed personage, he has labored to do, in his book <em>De Natura Deorum</em>,&mdash; or if he confesses that He exists, but denies that He is prescient of future things, what is that but just <q>the fool saying in his heart there is no God?</q> For one who is not prescient of all future things is not God. Wherefore our wills also have just so much power as God willed and foreknew that they should have; and therefore whatever power they have, they have it within most certain limits; and whatever they are to do, they are most assuredly to do, for He whose foreknowledge is infallible foreknew that they would have the power to do it, and would do it. Wherefore, if I should choose to apply the name of <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> to anything at all, I should rather say that <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> belongs to the weaker of two parties, will to the stronger, who has the other in his power, than that the freedom of our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is excluded by that order of causes, which, by an unusual application of the word peculiar to themselves, the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> call <em> Fate</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; Whether Our Wills are Ruled by Necessity.</h2>

<p>Wherefore, neither is that necessity to be feared, for dread of which the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> labored to make such distinctions among the causes of things as should enable them to rescue certain things from the dominion of necessity, and to subject others to it. Among those things which they wished not to be subject to necessity they placed our wills, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that they would not be free if subjected to necessity. For if that is to be called our necessity which is not in our power, but even though we be unwilling effects what it can effect&mdash;as, for instance, the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of death&mdash;it is manifest that our wills by which we live up-rightly or wickedly are not under such a necessity; for we do many things which, if we were not willing, we should certainly not do. This is primarily <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the act of willing itself&mdash;for if we will, it is; if we will not, it is not&mdash;for we should not will if we were unwilling. But if we define necessity to be that according to which we say that it is necessary that anything be of such or such a nature, or be done in such and such a manner, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not why we should have any dread of that necessity taking away the freedom of our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For we do not put the life of God or the foreknowledge of God under necessity if we should say that it is necessary that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should live forever, and foreknow all things; as neither is His power diminished when we say that He cannot die or fall into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>&mdash;for this is in such a way impossible to Him, that if it were possible for Him, He would be of less power. But assuredly He is rightly called <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, though He can neither die nor fall into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For He is called <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a> what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for the very reason that He is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>. So also, when we say that it is necessary that, when we will, we will by free choice, in so saying we both affirm what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and do not still subject our wills thereby to a necessity which destroys liberty. Our wills, therefore, <em>exist as wills</em>, and do themselves whatever we do by willing, and which would not be done if we were unwilling. But when any one suffers anything, being unwilling by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of another, even in that case will retains its essential validity, &mdash; we do not mean the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the party who  inflicts the suffering, for we resolve it into the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if a will should simply exist, but not be able to do what it wills, it would be overborne by a more powerful will. Nor would this be the case unless there had <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> will, and that not the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the other party, but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of him who willed, but was not able to accomplish what he willed. Therefore, whatsoever a man suffers contrary to his own will, he ought not to attribute to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or of any created spirit, but rather to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> who gives power to wills. It is not the case, therefore, that because God foreknew what would be in the power of our wills, there is for that reason nothing in the power of our wills. For he who foreknew this did not foreknow nothing. Moreover, if He who foreknew what would be in the power of our wills did not foreknow nothing, but something, assuredly, even though He did foreknow, there is something in the power of our wills. Therefore we are by no means compelled, either, retaining the prescience of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to take away the freedom of the will, or, retaining the freedom of the will, to deny that He is prescient of future things, which is impious. But we embrace both. We faithfully and sincerely confess both. The former, that we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> well; the latter, that we may live well. For he lives ill who does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> well concerning God. Wherefore, be it far from us, in order to maintain our freedom, to deny the prescience of Him by whose help we are or shall be free. Consequently, it is not in vain that <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are enacted, and that reproaches, exhortations, praises, and vituperations are had recourse to; for these also He foreknew, and they are of great avail, even as great as He foreknew that they would be of. Prayers, also, are of avail to procure those things which He foreknew that He would grant to those who offered them; and with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> have rewards been appointed for good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and punishments for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For a man does not therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> because God foreknew that he would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Nay, it cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> but that it is the man himself who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> when he does <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because He, whose foreknowledge is infallible, foreknew not that <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, or fortune, or something else would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but that the man himself would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, who, if he wills not, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not. But if he shall not will to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even this did God foreknow.</p>

<p>Therefore God supreme and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, with His Word and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> (which three are one), one God <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, creator and maker of every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and of every body; by whose gift all are <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> who are <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> through verity and not through vanity; who made man a rational animal consisting of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, who, when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, neither permitted him to go unpunished, nor left him without mercy; who has given to the good and to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, being in common with stones, vegetable life in common with trees, sensuous life in common with brutes, intellectual life in common with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> alone; from whom is every mode, every species, every order; from whom are measure, number, weight; from whom is everything which has an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in nature, of whatever kind it be, and of whatever value; from whom are the seeds of forms and the forms of seeds, and the motion of seeds and of forms; who gave also to flesh its origin, beauty, health, reproductive fecundity, disposition of members, and the salutary concord of its parts; who also to the irrational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has given memory, sense, appetite, but to the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in addition to these, has given intelligence and will; who has not left, not to speak of heaven and earth, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men, but not even the entrails of the smallest and most contemptible animal, or the feather of a bird, or the little flower of a plant, or the leaf of a tree, without an harmony, and, as it were, a mutual peace among all its parts&mdash;that God can never be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have left the kingdoms of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, their dominations and servitudes, outside of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; By What Virtues the Ancient Romans Merited that the True God, Although They Did Not Worship Him, Should Enlarge Their Empire.</h2>

<p>Wherefore let us go on to consider what <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the Romans they were which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whose power are also the kingdoms of the earth, condescended to help in order to raise the empire, and also for what reason He did so. And, in order to discuss this question on clearer ground, we have written the former books, to show that the power of those gods, who, they thought, were to be worshipped with such trifling and silly <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, had nothing to do in this matter; and also what we have already accomplished of the present volume, to refute the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, lest any one who might have been already persuaded that the Roman empire was not extended and preserved by the worship of these gods, might still be attributing its extension and preservation to some kind of <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, rather than to the most powerful <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> most high. The ancient and primitive Ro  mans, therefore, though their history shows us that, like all the other nations, with the sole exception of the Hebrews, they worshipped false gods, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> victims, not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, have nevertheless this commendation bestowed on them by their historian, that they were <q>greedy of praise, prodigal of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, desirous of great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and content with a moderate fortune.</q>  Glory they most ardently loved: for it they wished to live, for it they did not hesitate to die. Every other desire was repressed by the strength of their passion for that one thing. At length their country itself, because it seemed inglorious to serve, but <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> to rule and to command, they first earnestly desired to be free, and then to be mistress. Hence it was that, not enduring the domination of kings, they put the government into the hands of two chiefs, holding office for a year, who were called consuls, not kings or lords.  But royal pomp seemed inconsistent with the administration of a ruler (<em>regentis</em>), or the benevolence of one who consults (that is, for the public good) (<em>consulentis</em>), but rather with the haughtiness of a lord (<em>dominantis</em>). King Tarquin, therefore, having been banished, and the consular government having been instituted, it followed, as the same author already alluded to says in his praises of the Romans, that <q>the state grew with amazing rapidity after it had obtained liberty, so great a desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> had taken possession of it.</q> That eagerness for praise and desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, then, was that which accomplished those many wonderful things, laudable, doubtless, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment. The same Sallust praises the great men of his own time, Marcus Cato, and Caius C&aelig;sar, saying that for a long time the republic had no one great in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but that within his memory there had been these two men of eminent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and very different pursuits. Now, among the praises which he pronounces on C&aelig;sar he put this, that he wished for a great empire, an army, and a new <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, that he might have a sphere where his genius and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> might shine forth. Thus it was ever the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of men of heroic character that Bellona would excite miserable nations to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and lash them into agitation with her bloody scourge, so that there might be occasion for the display of their valor. This, forsooth, is what that desire of praise and thirst for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> did. Wherefore, by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of liberty in the first place, afterwards also by that of domination and through the desire of praise and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, they achieved many great things; and their most eminent poet testifies to their having been prompted by all these motives:</p>

<blockquote><p>Porsenna there, with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> elate,<br>
Bids Rome to Tarquin ope her gate;<br>
With arms he hems the city in,<br>
&AElig;neas' sons stand firm to win. </p></blockquote>

<p>At that time it was their greatest ambition either to die bravely or to live free; but when liberty was obtained, so great a desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> took possession of them, that liberty alone was not enough unless domination also should be sought, their great ambition being that which the same poet puts into the mouth of Jupiter:</p>

<blockquote><p>Nay, Juno's self, whose wild alarms<br>
Set ocean, earth, and heaven in arms,<br>
Shall change for smiles her moody frown,<br>
And vie with me in <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to crown<br>
Rome's sons, the nation of the gown.<br>
So stands my will. There comes a day,<br>
While Rome's great ages hold their way,<br>
When old Assaracus's sons<br>
Shall quit them on the myrmidons,<br>
O'er Phthia and Mycen&aelig; reign,<br>
And <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> Argos to their chain. </p></blockquote>

<p>Which things, indeed, Virgil makes Jupiter predict as future, while, in reality, he was only himself passing in review in his own <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, things which were already done, and which were beheld by him as present realities. But I have mentioned them with the intention of showing that, next to liberty, the Romans so highly esteemed domination, that it received a place among those things on which they bestowed the greatest praise. Hence also it is that that poet, preferring to the arts of other nations those arts which peculiarly belong to the Romans, namely, the arts of ruling and commanding, and of subjugating and vanquishing nations, says,</p>

<blockquote><p>Others, belike, with happier <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,<br>
From bronze or stone shall call the face,<br>
Plead doubtful causes, map the skies,<br>
And tell when planets set or rise;<br>
But Roman thou, do thou control<br>
The nations far and wide;<br>
Be this your genius, to impose<br>
The rule of peace on vanquished foes,<br>
Show pity to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,<br>
And crush the sons of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. </p></blockquote>

<p>These arts they exercised with the more skill the less they gave themselves up to pleasures, and to enervation of body and mind in <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveting</a> and amassing riches, and through these corrupting morals, by extorting them from the miserable citizens and lavishing them on base stage-players. Hence these men of base character, who abounded when  Sallust wrote and Virgil sang these things, did not seek after <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by these arts, but by treachery and deceit. Wherefore the same says, <q>But at first it was rather ambition than <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> that stirred the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, however, is nearer to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and power are desired alike by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man and by the ignoble; but the former,</q> he says, <q>strives onward to them by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> way, while the other, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> nothing of the good arts, seeks them by fraud and deceit.</q>  And what is meant by seeking the attainment of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and power by good arts, is to seek them by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and not by deceitful intrigue; for the good and the ignoble man alike desire these things, but the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man strives to overtake them by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> way. The way is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, along which he presses as to the goal of possession&mdash; namely, to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and power. Now that this was a sentiment engrained in the Roman <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, is indicated even by the temples of their gods; for they built in very close proximity the temples of Virtue and Honor, worshipping as gods the gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence we can understand what they who were good thought to be the end of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and to what they ultimately referred it, namely, to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; for, as to the bad, they had no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> though they desired <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and strove to possess it by fraud and deceit. Praise of a higher kind is bestowed upon Cato, for he says of him <q>The less he sought <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the more it followed him.</q>  We say praise of a higher kind; for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with the desire of which the Romans burned is the judgment of men thinking well of men. And therefore <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is better, which is content with no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment save that of one's own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Whence the apostle says, <q>For this is our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the testimony of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120205"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:12</a></span> And in another place he says, <q>But let every one prove his own work, and then he shall have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in himself, and not in another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120206"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;6:4</a></span> That <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and power, therefore, which they desired for themselves, and to which the good sought to attain by good arts, should not be sought after by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by them. For there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> except that which is directed towards that end in which is the highest and ultimate good of man. Wherefore even the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> which Cato sought he ought not to have sought, but the state ought to have conferred them on him unsolicited, on account of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.</p>

<p>But, of the two great Romans of that time, Cato was he whose <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was by far the nearest to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> idea of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Wherefore, let us refer to the opinion of Cato himself, to discover what was the judgment he had formed concerning the condition of the state both then and in former times. <q>I do not think,</q> he says, <q>that it was by arms that our ancestors made the republic great from being small. Had that been the case, the republic of our day would have been by far more flourishing than that of their times, for the number of our allies and citizens is far greater; and, besides, we possess a far greater abundance of armor and of horses than they did. But it was other things than these that made them great, and we have none of them: industry at home, just government without, a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> free in deliberation, addicted neither to crime nor to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Instead of these, we have luxury and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, poverty in the state, opulence among citizens; we laud riches, we follow laziness; there is no difference made between the good and the bad; all the rewards of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are got possession of by intrigue. And no wonder, when every individual consults only for his own good, when you are the slaves of pleasure at home, and, in public affairs, of money and favor, no wonder that an onslaught is made upon the unprotected republic.</q> </p>

<p>He who hears these words of Cato or of Sallust probably thinks that such praise bestowed on the ancient Romans was applicable to all of them, or, at least, to very many of them. It is not so; otherwise the things which Cato himself writes, and which I have quoted in the second book of this work, would not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. In that passage he says, that even from the very beginning of the state wrongs were committed by the more powerful, which led to the separation of the people from the fathers, besides which there were other internal dissensions; and the only time at which there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> and moderate administration was after the banishment of the kings, and that no longer than while they had <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be afraid of Tarquin, and were carrying on the grievous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which had been undertaken on his account against Etruria; but afterwards the fathers oppressed the people as slaves, flogged them as the kings had done, drove them from their land, and, to the exclusion of all others, held the government in their own hands alone. And to these discords, while the fathers were wishing to rule, and the people were unwilling to serve, the second Punic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> put an end; for again great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> began to press upon their disquieted minds, holding them back from those distractions by another and greater anxiety, and  bringing them back to civil concord. But the great things which were then achieved were accomplished through the administration of a few men, who were good in their own way. And by the wisdom and forethought of these few good men, which first enabled the republic to endure these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> and mitigated them, it waxed greater and greater. And this the same historian affirms, when he says that, reading and hearing of the many illustrious achievements of the Roman people in peace and in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, by land and by sea, he wished to understand what it was by which these great things were specially sustained. For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that very often the Romans had with a small company contended with great legions of the enemy; and he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> also that with small resources they had carried on <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with opulent kings. And he says that, after having given the matter much consideration, it seemed evident to him that the pre-eminent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a few citizens had achieved the whole, and that that explained how poverty overcame <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and small numbers great multitudes. But, he adds, after that the state had been corrupted by luxury and indolence, again the republic, by its own greatness, was able to bear the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of its magistrates and generals. Wherefore even the praises of Cato are only applicable to a few; for only a few were possessed of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which leads men to pursue after <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and power by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> way&mdash;that is, by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself. This industry at home, of which Cato speaks, was the consequence of a desire to enrich the public treasury, even though the result should be poverty at home; and therefore, when he speaks of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> arising out of the corruption of morals, he reverses the expression, and says, <q>Poverty in the state, riches at home.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; Concerning the Love of Praise, Which, Though It is a Vice, is Reckoned a Virtue, Because by It Greater Vice is Restrained.</h2>

<p>Wherefore, when the kingdoms of the East had been illustrious for a long time, it pleased God that there should also arise a Western empire, which, though later in time, should be more illustrious in extent and greatness. And, in order that it might overcome the grievous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> among other nations, He purposely granted it to such men as, for the sake of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and praise, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, consulted well for their country, in whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> they sought their own, and whose safety they did not hesitate to prefer to their own, suppressing the desire of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and many other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> for this one <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, namely, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of praise. For he has the soundest perception who recognizes that even the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of praise is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>; nor has this escaped the perception of the poet Horace, who says,</p>

<blockquote><p>You're bloated by ambition? Take advice:<br>
Yon book will ease you if you read it thrice. <br>
&nbsp;And the same poet, in a lyric song, has thus spoken with the desire of repressing the passion for domination:</p>

<p>Rule an ambitious spirit, and you have<br>
A wider kingdom than if you should join<br>
To distant Gades Lybia, and thus</p>

<p>Should hold in service either Carthaginian. </p></blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, they who restrain baser <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, not by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> obtained by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, or by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of intelligible beauty, but by desire of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise, or, at all events, restrain them better by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of such praise, are not indeed yet <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, but only less base. Even Tully was not able to conceal this fact; for, in the same books which he wrote, <em>De Republica</em>, when speaking concerning the education of a chief of the state, who ought, he says, to be nourished on <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, goes on to say that their ancestors did many wonderful and illustrious things through desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. So far, therefore, from resisting this <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, they even thought that it ought to be excited and kindled up, supposing that that would be beneficial to the republic. But not even in his books on <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> does Tully dissimulate this poisonous opinion, for he there avows it more clearly than day. For when he is speaking of those studies which are to be pursued with a view to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> good, and not with the vainglorious desire of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise, he introduces the following universal and general statement:</p>

<blockquote><p><q>Honor nourishes the arts, and all are stimulated to the prosecution of studies by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and those pursuits are always neglected which are generally discredited.</q> </p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; Concerning the Eradication of the Love of Human Praise, Because All the Glory of the Righteous is in God.</h2>

<p>It is, therefore, doubtless far better to resist this desire than to yield to it, for the purer one is from this defilement, the liker is he to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and, though this <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> be not thoroughly eradicated from his heart&mdash;for it does not cease to tempt even the minds of those who are making good progress in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>&mdash;at any rate, let the desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> be surpassed by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of righteousness, so that, if there be seen anywhere <q>lying neglected things which are generally discredited,</q>  if they are good, if they are right, even the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise may blush and yield to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

For their Master had taught them not to seek to be good for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, saying, <q>Take heed that you do not your righteousness before men to be seen of them, or otherwise you shall not have a reward from your Father who is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120214"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;6:1</a></span> But again, lest, understanding this wrongly, they should, through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of pleasing men, be less useful through concealing their goodness, showing for what end they ought to make it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, He says, <q>Let your works shine before men, that they may see your good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120215"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;5:16</a></span> Not, observe, <q>that you may be seen by them, that is, in order that their eyes may be directed upon you,</q>&mdash; for of yourselves you are, nothing&mdash;but <q>that they may glorify your Father who is in heaven,</q> by fixing their regards on whom they may become such as you are. These the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> followed, who surpassed the Sc&aelig;volas, and the Curtiuses, and the Deciuses, both in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and also in the greatness of their number. But since those Romans were in an earthly city, and had before them, as the end of all the offices undertaken in its behalf, its safety, and a kingdom, not in heaven, but in earth&mdash;not in the sphere of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, but in the sphere of demise and succession, where the dead are succeeded by the dying&mdash;what else but <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> should they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, by which they wished even after death to live in the mouths of their admirers?</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; Concerning the Temporal Reward Which God Granted to the Virtues of the Romans.</h2>

<p>Now, therefore, with regard to those to whom God did not purpose to give <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life with His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in His own celestial city, to the society of which that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> which does not render the service of religion, which the Greeks call <span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, to any save the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God conducts, if He had also withheld from them the terrestrial <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of that most excellent empire, a reward would not have been rendered to their good arts&mdash;that is, their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>&mdash;by which they sought to attain so great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For as to those who seem to do some good that they may receive <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from men, the Lord also says, <q>Verily I say unto you, they have received their reward.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120216"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;6:2</a></span> So also these despised their own private affairs for the sake of the republic, and for its treasury resisted <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, consulted for the good of their country with a spirit of freedom, addicted neither to what their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> pronounced to be crime nor to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. By all these acts, as by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> way, they pressed forward to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, power, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; they were <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> among almost all nations; they imposed the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of their empire upon many nations; and at this day, both in literature and history, they are <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> among almost all nations. There is no reason why they should complain against the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the supreme and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;<q>they have received their reward.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; Concerning the Reward of the Holy Citizens of the Celestial City, to Whom the Example of the Virtues of the Romans are Useful.</h2>

<p>But the reward of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is far different, who even here endured reproaches for that  city of God which is hateful to the lovers of this world. That city is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. There none are born, for none die. There is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and full felicity&mdash;not a goddess, but a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thence we receive the pledge of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> while on our pilgrimage we sigh for its beauty. There rises not the sun on the good and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but the Sun of Righteousness protects the good alone. There no great industry shall be expended to enrich the public treasury by suffering privations at home, for there is the common treasury of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And, therefore, it was not only for the sake of recompensing the citizens of Rome that her empire and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> had been so signally extended, but also that the citizens of that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> city, during their pilgrimage here, might diligently and soberly contemplate these examples, and see what a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> they owe to the supernal country on account of life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, if the terrestrial country was so much beloved by its citizens on account of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.&mdash; To What Profit the Romans Carried on Wars, and How Much They Contributed to the Well-Being of Those Whom They Conquered.</h2>

<p>For, as far as this life of mortals is concerned, which is spent and ended in a few days, what does it matter under whose government a dying man lives, if they who govern do not force him to impiety and iniquity? Did the Romans at all harm those nations, on whom, when subjugated, they imposed their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, except in as far as that was accomplished with great slaughter in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>? Now, had it been done with consent of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, it would have been done with greater success, but there would have been no <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of conquest, for neither did the Romans themselves live exempt from those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which they imposed on others. Had this been done without Mars and Bellona, so that there should have been no place for victory, no one conquering where no one had fought, would not the condition of the Romans and of the other nations have been one and the same, especially if that had been done at once which afterwards was done most humanely and most acceptably, namely, the admission of all to the rights of Roman citizens who belonged to the Roman empire, and if that had been made the privilege of all which was formerly the privilege of a few, with this one condition, that the humbler class who had no lands of their own should live at the public expense&mdash; an alimentary impost, which would have been paid with a much better <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> by them into the hands of good administrators of the republic, of which they were members, by their own hearty consent, than it would have been paid with had it to be extorted from them as conquered men? For I do not see what it makes for the safety, good morals, and certainly not for the dignity, of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that some have conquered and others have been conquered, except that it yields them that most insane pomp of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in which <q>they have received their reward,</q> who burned with excessive desire of it, and carried on most eager <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. For do not their lands pay tribute? Have they any privilege of learning what the others are not privileged to learn? Are there not many senators in the other countries who do not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Rome by sight? Take away outward show,  and what are all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> after all but men? But even though the perversity of the age should permit that all the better men should be more highly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> than others, neither thus should <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> be held at a great price, for it is smoke which has no weight. But let us avail ourselves even in these things of the kindness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Let us consider how great things they despised, how great things they endured, what <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> they subdued for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, who merited that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as it were, in reward for such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; and let this be useful to us even in suppressing <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, so that, as that city in which it has been promised us to reign as far surpasses this one as heaven is distant from the earth, as <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life surpasses temporal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, solid <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> empty praise, or the society of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> the society of mortals, or the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him who made the sun and moon the light of the sun and moon, the citizens of so great a country may not seem to themselves to have done anything very great, if, in order to obtain it, they have done some good works or endured some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, when those men for this terrestrial country already obtained, did such great things, suffered such great things. And especially are all these things to be considered, because the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which collects citizens to the celestial country has something in it to which a shadowy resemblance is found in that asylum of Romulus, whither escape from the punishment of all manner of crimes congregated that multitude with which the state was to be founded.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; How Far Christians Ought to Be from Boasting, If They Have Done Anything for the Love of the Eternal Country, When the Romans Did Such Great Things for Human Glory and a Terrestrial City.</h2>

<p>What great thing, therefore, is it for that  <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and celestial city to despise all the charms of this world, however pleasant, if for the sake of this terrestrial city Brutus could even <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> his son&mdash;a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> which the heavenly city compels no one to make? But certainly it is more difficult to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> one's sons, than to do what is required to be done for the heavenly country, even to distribute to the poor those things which were looked upon as things to be massed and laid up for one's children, or to let them go, if there arise any <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> which compels us to do so, for the sake of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and righteousness. For it is not earthly riches which make us or our sons <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; for they must either be lost by us in our lifetime, or be possessed when we are dead, by whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, or perhaps by whom we would not. But it is God who makes us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> riches of minds. But of Brutus, even the poet who celebrates his praises testifies that it was the occasion of unhappiness to him that he slew his son, for he says,</p>

<blockquote><p>And call his own rebellious seed<br>
For menaced liberty to bleed.<br>
Unhappy father! howsoe'er<br>
The deed be judged by after days. <br>
But in the following verse he consoles him in his unhappiness, saying,<br>
<q>His country's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> shall all o'erbear.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>There are those two things, namely, liberty and the desire of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise, which compelled the Romans to admirable <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. If, therefore, for the liberty of dying men, and for the desire of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise which is sought after by mortals, sons could be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by a father, what great thing is it, if, for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> liberty which has made us free from the dominion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and death, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>&mdash;not through the desire of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise, but through the earnest desire of fleeing men, not from King Tarquin, but from <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and the prince of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>&mdash;we should, I do not say <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> our sons, but reckon among our sons Christ's poor ones? If, also, another Roman chief, surnamed Torquatus, slew his son, not because he fought against his country, but because, being challenged by an enemy, he through youthful impetuosity fought, though for his country, yet contrary to orders which he his father had given as general; and this he did, notwithstanding that his son was victorious, lest there should be more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the example of authority despised, than good in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of slaying an enemy&mdash;if, I say, Torquatus acted thus, wherefore should they boast themselves, who, for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of a celestial country, despise all earthly <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, which are loved far less than sons? If Furius Camillus, who was condemned by those who envied him, notwithstanding that he had thrown off from the necks of his countrymen the yoke of their most bitter enemies, the Veientes, again delivered his ungrateful country from the Gauls, because he had no other in which he could have better opportunities for living a life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>&mdash;if Camillus did thus, why should he be extolled as having done some great thing, who, having, it may be, suffered in the church at the hands of carnal enemies most grievous and dishonoring injury, has not betaken himself to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> enemies, or himself raised some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> against her, but has rather defended her, as far as he was able, from the most pernicious perversity of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, since there is not another church, I say not in which one can live a life of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but in which <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life can be obtained? If Mucius, in order that peace might be made with King Porsenna, who was pressing the Romans with a most grievous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, when he did not succeed in slaying Porsenna, but slew another by mistake for him, reached forth his right hand and laid it on a red-hot altar, saying that many such as he saw him to be had conspired for his destruction, so that Porsenna, terrified at his daring, and at the thought of a conspiracy of such as he, without any delay recalled all his warlike purposes, and made peace&mdash;if, I say, Mucius did this, who shall speak of his meritorious claims to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, if for it he may have given to the flames not one hand, but even his whole body, and that not by his own spontaneous act, but because he was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by another? If Curtius, spurring on his steed, threw himself all armed into a precipitous gulf, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> the oracles of their gods, which had commanded that the Romans should throw into that gulf the best thing which they possessed, and they could only understand thereby that, since they excelled in men and arms, the gods had commanded that an armed man should be cast headlong into that destruction&mdash;if he did this, shall we say that that man has done a great thing for the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> city who may have died by a like death, not, however, precipitating himself spontaneously into a gulf, but having suffered this death at the hands of some enemy of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, more especially when he has received from his Lord, who is also King of his country, a more certain oracle, <q>Fear not them who kill the body, but cannot kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120219"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;10:28</a></span> If the Decii dedicated themselves to death, consecrating themselves in a form  of words, as it were, that falling, and pacifying by their blood the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the gods, they might be the means of delivering the Roman army&mdash;if they did this, let not the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> carry themselves proudly, as though they had done some meritorious thing for a share in that country where are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life and felicity, if even to the shedding of their blood, loving not only the brethren for whom it was shed, but, according as had been commanded them, even their enemies by whom it was being shed, they have vied with one another in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. If Marcus Pulvillus, when engaged in dedicating a temple to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, received with such indifference the false intelligence which was brought to him of the death of his son, with the intention of so agitating him that he should go away, and thus the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of dedicating the temple should fall to his colleague;&mdash; if he received that intelligence with such indifference that he even ordered that his son should be cast out unburied, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> having overcome in his heart the grief of bereavement, how shall any one affirm that he had done a great thing for the preaching of the gospel, by which the citizens of the heavenly city are delivered from various <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and gathered together from various wanderings, to whom his Lord has said, when anxious about the burial of his father, <q>Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120220"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;8:22</a></span> Regulus, in order not to break his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, even with his most cruel enemies, returned to them from Rome itself, because (as he is said to have replied to the Romans when they wished to retain him) he could not have the dignity of an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> citizen at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> after having been a slave to the Africans, and the Carthaginians put him to death with the utmost tortures, because he had spoken against them in the senate. If Regulus acted thus, what tortures are not to be despised for the sake of good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> toward that country to whose beatitude <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself leads? Or what will a man have rendered to the Lord for all He has bestowed upon him, if, for the faithfulness he owes to Him, he shall have suffered such things as Regulus suffered at the hands of his most ruthless enemies for the good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he owed to them? And how shall a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> dare vaunt himself of his <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> poverty, which he has chosen in order that during the pilgrimage of this life he may walk the more disencumbered on the way which leads to the country where the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> riches are, even God Himself&mdash;how, I say, shall he vaunt himself for this, when he hears or reads that Lucius Valerius, who died when he was holding the office of consul, was so poor that his funeral expenses were paid with money collected by the people?&mdash; or when he hears that Quintius Cincinnatus, who, possessing only four acres of land, and cultivating them with his own hands, was taken from the plough to be made dictator,&mdash; an office more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> even than that of consul,&mdash; and that, after having won great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by conquering the enemy, he preferred notwithstanding to continue in his poverty? Or how shall he boast of having done a great thing, who has not been prevailed upon by the offer of any reward of this world to renounce his connection with that heavenly and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> country, when he hears that Fabricius could not be prevailed on to forsake the Roman city by the great gifts offered to him by Pyrrhus king of the Epirots, who promised him the fourth part of his kingdom, but preferred to abide there in his poverty as a private individual? For if, when their republic&mdash;that is, the interest of the people, the interest of the country, the common interest,&mdash; was most prosperous and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>, they themselves were so poor in their own houses, that one of them, who had already been twice a consul, was expelled from that senate of poor men by the censor, because he was discovered to possess ten pounds weight of silverplate,&mdash; since, I say, those very men by whose triumphs the public treasury was enriched were so poor, ought not all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who make common property of their riches with a far nobler purpose, even that (according to what is written in the Acts of the Apostles) they may distribute to each one according to his need, and that no one may say that anything is his own, but that all things may be their common possession, <span class="stiki" id="note120221"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse45">Acts&nbsp;2:45</a></span> &mdash; ought they not to understand that they should not vaunt themselves, because they do that to obtain the society of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, when those men did nearly the same thing to preserve the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Romans?</p>

<p>How could these, and whatever like things are found in the Roman history, have become so widely <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and have been proclaimed by so great a fame, had not the Roman empire, extending far and wide, been raised to its greatness by magnificent successes? Wherefore, through that empire, so extensive and of so long continuance, so illustrious and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> also through the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of such great men, the reward which they sought was rendered to their earnest aspirations, and also examples are set before us, containing necessary admonition, in order that we may be  stung with shame if we shall see that we have not held fast those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> for the sake of the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which are, in whatever way, resembled by those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which they held fast for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of a terrestrial city, and that, too, if we shall feel conscious that we have held them fast, we may not be lifted up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, because, as the apostle says, <q>The sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which shall be revealed in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120222"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;8:18</a></span> But so far as regards <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and temporal <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the lives of these ancient Romans were reckoned sufficiently worthy. Therefore, also, we see, in the light of that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which, veiled in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, is revealed in the New, namely, that it is not in view of terrestrial and temporal benefits, which <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> grants promiscuously to good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that God is to be worshipped, but in view of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, everlasting gifts, and of the society of the heavenly city itself&mdash;in the light of this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> we see that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were most righteously given as a trophy to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Romans; for we see that these Romans, who rested on earthly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and sought to obtain it by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, such as they were, conquered those who, in their great depravity, slew and rejected the giver of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> city.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; Concerning the Difference Between True Glory and the Desire of Domination.</h2>

<p>There is assuredly a difference between the desire of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the desire of domination; for, though he who has an overweening delight in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> will be also very prone to aspire earnestly after domination, nevertheless they who desire the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> even of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise strive not to displease those who judge well of them. For there are many good moral qualities, of which many are competent judges, although they are not possessed by many; and by those good moral qualities those men press on to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and domination, of whom Sallust says, <q>But they press on by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> way.</q></p>

<p>But whosoever, without possessing that desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which makes one <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to displease those who judge his conduct, desires domination and power, very often seeks to obtain what he loves by most open crimes. Therefore he who desires <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> presses on to obtain it either by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> way, or certainly by deceit and artifice, wishing to appear good when he is not. Therefore to him who possesses <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> it is a great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to despise <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; for contempt of it is seen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but is not manifest to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgment. For whatever any one does before the eyes of men in order to show himself to be a despiser of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, if they suspect that he is doing it in order to get greater praise&mdash;that is, greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>&mdash;he has no means of demonstrating to the perceptions of those who suspect him that the case is really otherwise than they suspect it to be. But he who despises the judgment of praisers, despises also the rashness of suspectors. Their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, indeed, he does not despise, if he is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> good; for so great is the righteousness of that man who receives his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, that he loves his very enemies, and so loves them that he desires that his haters and detractors may be turned to righteousness, and become his associates, and that not in an earthly but in a heavenly country. But with respect to his praisers, though he sets little value on their praise, he does not set little value on their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; neither does he elude their praise, lest he should forfeit their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And, therefore, he strives earnestly to have their praises directed to Him from whom every one receives whatever in him is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> praiseworthy. But he who is a despiser of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but is greedy of domination, exceeds the beasts in the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of cruelty and luxuriousness. Such, indeed, were certain of the Romans, who, wanting the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of esteem, wanted not the thirst for domination; and that there were many such, history testifies. But it was <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> C&aelig;sar who was the first to reach the summit, and, as it were, the citadel, of this <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>; for so great was his luxuriousness, that one would have thought there was nothing manly to be dreaded in him, and such his cruelty, that, had not the contrary been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, no one would have thought there was anything effeminate in his character. Nevertheless power and domination are not given even to such men save by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He judges that the state of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs is worthy of such lords. The divine utterance is clear on this matter; for the Wisdom of God thus speaks: <q>By me kings reign, and tyrants possess the land.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120223"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse15">Proverbs&nbsp;8:15</a></span> But, that it may not be thought that by <q>tyrants</q> is meant, not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and impious kings, but brave men, in accordance with the ancient use of the word, as when Virgil says,</p>

<blockquote><p>For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that treaty may not stand<br>
Where king greets king and joins not hand, </p></blockquote>

<p>in another place it is most unambiguously said of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He <q>makes the man who is an hypocrite to reign on account of the perversity  of the people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120225"><a href="../bible/job034.htm#verse30">Job&nbsp;34:30</a></span> Wherefore, though I have, according to my ability, shown for what reason <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who alone is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and just, helped forward the Romans, who were good according to a certain standard of an earthly state, to the acquirement of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of so great an empire, there may be, nevertheless, a more hidden <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> better to God than to us, depending on the diversity of the merits of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Among all who are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, it is at all events agreed that no one without <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>&mdash;that is, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worship of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God&mdash; can have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and that it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is the slave of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise. Though, nevertheless, they who are not citizens of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> city, which is called the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the sacred Scriptures, are more useful to the earthly city when they possess even that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than if they had not even that. But there could be nothing more fortunate for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs than that, by the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they who are endowed with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of life, if they have the skill for ruling people, should also have the power. But such men, however great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> they may possess in this life, attribute it solely to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God that He has bestowed it on them&mdash; willing, believing, seeking. And, at the same time, they understand how far they are short of that perfection of righteousness which exists in the society of those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> for which they are striving to fit themselves. But however much that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be praised and cried up, which without <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is the slave of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, it is not at all to be compared even to the feeble beginnings of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, whose hope is placed in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; That It is as Shameful for the Virtues to Serve Human Glory as Bodily Pleasure.</h2>

<p>Philosophers&mdash;who place the end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> good in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself, in order to put to shame certain other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who indeed approve of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, but measure them all with reference to the end of bodily pleasure, and think that this pleasure is to be sought for its own sake, but the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> on account of pleasure&mdash;are wont to paint a kind of word-picture, in which Pleasure sits like a luxurious queen on a royal seat, and all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are subjected to her as slaves, watching her nod, that they may do whatever she shall command. She commands Prudence to be ever on the watch to discover how Pleasure may rule, and be safe. Justice she orders to grant what benefits she can, in order to secure those friendships which are necessary for bodily pleasure; to do wrong to no one, lest, on account of the breaking of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, Pleasure be not able to live in security. Fortitude she orders to keep her mistress, that is, Pleasure, bravely in her <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, if any affliction befall her body which does not occasion death, in order that by remembrance of former delights she may mitigate the poignancy of present pain. Temperance she commands to take only a certain quantity even of the most favorite food, lest, through immoderate use, anything prove hurtful by disturbing the health of the body, and thus Pleasure, which the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> make to consist chiefly in the health of the body, be grievously offended. Thus the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, with the whole dignity of their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, will be the slaves of Pleasure, as of some imperious and disreputable <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</p>

<p>There is nothing, say our <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, more disgraceful and monstrous than this picture, and which the eyes of good men can less endure. And they say the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But I do not think that the picture would be sufficiently becoming, even if it were made so that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> should be represented as the slaves of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; for, though that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> be not a luxurious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, it is nevertheless puffed up, and has much vanity in it. Wherefore it is unworthy of the solidity and firmness of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to represent them as serving this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, so that Prudence shall provide nothing, Justice distribute nothing, Temperance moderate nothing, except to the end that men may be pleased and vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> served. Nor will they be able to defend themselves from the charge of such baseness, while they, by way of being despisers of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, disregard the judgment of other men, seem to themselves wise, and please themselves. For their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>&mdash;if, indeed, it is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> at all&mdash;is only in another way subjected to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise; for he who seeks to please himself seeks still to please man. But he who, with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom he loves, believes, and hopes in, fixes his attention more on those things in which he displeases himself, than on those things, if there are any such, which please himself, or rather, not himself, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, does not attribute that by which he can now please the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to anything but to the mercy of Him whom he has feared to displease, giving thanks for what in him is healed, and pouring out <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the healing of that which is yet unhealed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.&mdash; That the Roman Dominion Was Granted by Him from Whom is All Power, and by Whose Providence All Things are Ruled.</h2>

<p>These things being so, we do not attribute  the power of giving kingdoms and empires to any save to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gives <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> alone, but gives kingly power on earth both to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and the impious, as it may please Him, whose good pleasure is always just. For though we have said something about the principles which guide His administration, in so far as it has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to Him to explain it, nevertheless it is too much for us, and far surpasses our strength, to discuss the hidden things of men's hearts, and by a clear examination to determine the merits of various kingdoms. He, therefore, who is the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who never leaves the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> without just judgment and help, gave a kingdom to the Romans when He would, and as great as He would, as He did also to the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and even the Persians, by whom, as their own books testify, only two gods are worshipped, the one good and the other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>&mdash;to say nothing concerning the Hebrew people, of whom I have already spoken as much as seemed necessary, who, as long as they were a kingdom, worshipped none save the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. The same, therefore, who gave to the Persians harvests, though they did not worship the goddess Segetia, who gave the other blessings of the earth, though they did not worship the many gods which the Romans supposed to preside, each one over some particular thing, or even many of them over each several thing&mdash;He, I say, gave the Persians dominion, though they worshipped none of those gods to whom the Romans <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> themselves indebted for the empire. And the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in respect of men as well as nations. He who gave power to Marius gave it also to Caius C&aelig;sar; He who gave it to Augustus gave it also to <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>; He also who gave it to the most benignant emperors, the Vespasians, father and son, gave it also to the cruel <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>; and, finally, to avoid the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of going over them all, He who gave it to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Constantine gave it also to the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> Julian, whose gifted mind was deceived by a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> and detestable curiosity, stimulated by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of power. And it was because he was addicted through curiosity to vain oracles, that, confident of victory, he burned the ships which were laden with the provisions necessary for his army, and therefore, engaging with hot <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in rashly audacious enterprises, he was soon slain, as the just consequence of his recklessness, and left his army unprovisioned in an enemy's country, and in such a predicament that it never could have escaped, save by altering the boundaries of the Roman empire, in violation of that omen of the god Terminus of which I spoke in the preceding book; for the god Terminus yielded to necessity, though he had not yielded to Jupiter. Manifestly these things are ruled and governed by the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> according as He pleases; and if His motives are hid, are they therefore <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; The Durations and Issues of War Depend on the Will of God.</h2>

<p>Thus also the durations of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> are determined by Him as He may see meet, according to His righteous will, and pleasure, and mercy, to afflict or to console the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, so that they are sometimes of longer, sometimes of shorter duration. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the Pirates and the third Punic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> were terminated with incredible celerity. Also the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the fugitive gladiators, though in it many Roman generals and the consuls were defeated, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was terribly wasted and ravaged, was nevertheless ended in the third year, having itself been, during its continuance, the end of much. The Picentes, the Marsi, and the Peligni, not distant but Italian nations, after a long and most loyal servitude under the Roman yoke, attempted to raise their heads into liberty, though many nations had now been subjected to the Roman power, and <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> had been overthrown. In this Italian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> the Romans were very often defeated, and two consuls perished, besides other noble senators; nevertheless this calamity was not protracted over a long space of time, for the fifth year put an end to it. But the second Punic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, lasting for the space of eighteen years, and occasioning the greatest disasters and calamities to the republic, wore out and nearly consumed the strength of the Romans; for in two battles about seventy thousand Romans fell.  The first Punic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was terminated after having been waged for three-and-twenty years. The Mithridatic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was waged for forty years. And that no one may think that in the early and much belauded times of the Romans they were far braver and more able to bring <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> to a speedy termination, the Samnite <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was protracted for nearly fifty years; and in this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> the Romans were so beaten that they were even put under the yoke. But because they did not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for the sake of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but seemed rather to have loved <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, they broke the peace and the treaty which had been concluded. These things I mention, because many, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of past things, and some also dissimulating what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, if in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> times they see any <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>  protracted a little longer than they expected, straightway make a fierce and insolent attack on our religion, exclaiming that, but for it, the deities would have been supplicated still, according to ancient <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>; and then, by that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> of the Romans, which, with the help of Mars and Bellona, speedily brought to an end such great <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> also would be speedily terminated. Let them, therefore, who have read history recollect what long-continued <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, having various issues and entailing woeful slaughter, were waged by the ancient Romans, in accordance with the general <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that the earth, like the tempestuous deep, is subject to agitations from tempests&mdash; tempests of such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, in various degrees&mdash;and let them sometimes confess what they do not like to own, and not, by madly speaking against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, destroy themselves and deceive the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.&mdash; Concerning the War in Which Radagaisus, King of the Goths, a Worshipper of Demons, Was Conquered in One Day, with All His Mighty Forces.</h2>

<p>Nevertheless they do not mention with thanksgiving what God has very recently, and within our own memory, wonderfully and mercifully done, but as far as in them lies they attempt, if possible, to bury it in universal oblivion. But should we be silent about these things, we should be in like manner ungrateful. When Radagaisus, king of the Goths, having taken up his position very near to the city, with a vast and savage army, was already close upon the Romans, he was in one day so speedily and so thoroughly beaten, that, while not even one Roman was wounded, much less slain, far more than a hundred thousand of his army were prostrated, and he himself and his sons, having been captured, were immediately <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, suffering the punishment they deserved. For had so impious a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, with so great and so impious a host, entered the city, whom would he have spared? What tombs of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> would he have respected? In his treatment of what person would he have manifested the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God? Whose blood would he have refrained from shedding? Whose <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> would he have wished to preserve inviolate? But how loud would they not have been in the praises of their gods! How insultingly they would have boasted, saying that Radagaisus had conquered, that he had been able to achieve such great things, because he propitiated and won over the gods by daily <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>&mdash;a thing which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> did not allow the Romans to do! For when he was approaching to those places where he was overwhelmed at the nod of the Supreme Majesty, as his fame was everywhere increasing, it was being told us at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> that the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> were believing, publishing, and boasting, that he, on account of the help and protection of the gods friendly to him, because of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> which he was said to be daily offering to them, would certainly not be conquered by those who were not performing such <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to the Roman gods, and did not even permit that they should be offered by any one. And now these wretched men do not give thanks to God for his great mercy, who, having determined to chastise the corruption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which was worthy of far heavier chastisement than the corruption of the barbarians, tempered His indignation with such mildness as, in the first instance, to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that the king of the Goths should be conquered in a wonderful manner, lest <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> should accrue to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, whom he was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be supplicating, and thus the minds of the weak should be overthrown; and then, afterwards, to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that, when Rome was to be taken, it should be taken by those barbarians who, contrary to any custom of all former <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, protected, through reverence for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, those who fled for refuge to the sacred places, and who so opposed the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> themselves, and the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of impious <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, that they seemed to be carrying on a far more terrible <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with them than with men. Thus did the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lord and Governor of things both scourge the Romans mercifully, and, by the marvellous defeat of the worshippers of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, show that those <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were not necessary even for the safety of present things; so that, by those who do not obstinately hold out, but prudently consider the matter, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion may not be deserted on account of the urgencies of the present time, but may be more clung to in most confident expectation of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.&mdash; What Was the Happiness of the Christian Emperors, and How Far It Was True Happiness.</h2>

<p>For neither do we say that certain <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors were therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> because they ruled a long time, or, dying a peaceful death, left their sons to succeed them in the empire, or subdued the enemies of the republic, or were able both to guard against and to suppress the attempt of hostile citizens rising against them. These and other gifts or comforts of this sorrowful life even certain worshippers of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have merited to receive, who do not belong to the kingdom of God to  which these belong; and this is to be traced to the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who would not have those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him desire such things as the highest good. But we say that they are <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> if they rule <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>; if they are not lifted up amid the praises of those who pay them sublime <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, and the obsequiousness of those who salute them with an excessive humility, but remember that they are men; if they make their power the handmaid of His majesty by using it for the greatest possible extension of His worship; if they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; if more than their own they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that kingdom in which they are not afraid to have partners; if they are slow to punish, ready to pardon; if they apply that punishment as necessary to government and defence of the republic, and not in order to gratify their own enmity; if they grant pardon, not that iniquity may go unpunished, but with the hope that the transgressor may amend his ways; if they compensate with the lenity of mercy and the liberality of benevolence for whatever severity they may be compelled to decree; if their luxury is as much restrained as it might have been unrestrained; if they prefer to govern depraved desires rather than any nation whatever; and if they do all these things, not through ardent desire of empty <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> felicity, not neglecting to offer to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of humility, contrition, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Such <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors, we say, are <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in the present time by hope, and are destined to be so in the enjoyment of the reality itself, when that which we wait for shall have arrived.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25.&mdash; Concerning the Prosperity Which God Granted to the Christian Emperor Constantine.</h2>

<p>For the good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lest men, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is to be worshipped with a view to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, should think that no one could attain to all this high estate, and to this terrestrial dominion, unless he should be a worshipper of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>&mdash;supposing that these spirits have great power with respect to such things&mdash;for this reason He gave to the Emperor Constantine, who was not a worshipper of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God Himself, such fullness of earthly gifts as no one would even dare wish for. To him also He granted the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of founding a city,  a companion to the Roman empire, the daughter, as it were, of Rome itself, but without any temple or image of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. He reigned for a long period as sole emperor, and unaided held and defended the whole Roman world. In conducting and carrying on <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> he was most victorious; in overthrowing tyrants he was most successful. He died at a great age, of sickness and old age, and left his sons to succeed him in the empire.  But again, lest any emperor should become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in order to merit the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of Constantine, when every one should be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> for the sake of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, God took away Jovian far sooner than Julian, and permitted that Gratian should be slain by the sword of a tyrant. But in his case there was far more mitigation of the calamity than in the case of the great Pompey, for he could not be avenged by Cato, whom he had left, as it were, heir to the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. But Gratian, though <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> minds require not such consolations, was avenged by Theodosius, whom he had associated with himself in the empire, though he had a little brother of his own, being more desirous of a faithful alliance than of extensive power.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.&mdash; On the Faith and Piety of Theodosius Augustus.</h2>

<p>And on this account, Theodosius not only preserved during the lifetime of Gratian that fidelity which was due to him, but also, after his death, he, like a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, took his little brother Valentinian under his protection, as joint emperor, after he had been expelled by Maximus, the murderer of his father. He guarded him with paternal affection, though he might without any difficulty have got rid of him, being entirely destitute of all resources, had he been animated with the desire of extensive empire, and not with the ambition of being a benefactor. It was therefore a far greater pleasure to him, when he had adopted the boy, and preserved to him his imperial dignity, to console him by his very humanity and kindness. Afterwards, when that success was rendering Maximus terrible, Theodosius, in the midst of his perplexing anxieties, was not drawn away to follow the suggestions of a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> and unlawful curiosity, but sent to John, whose abode was in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>&mdash;for he had learned that this servant of God (whose fame was spreading abroad) was endowed with the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>&mdash;and from him he received assurance of victory. Immediately the slayer of the tyrant Maximus, with the deepest feelings of compassion and respect, restored the boy Valentinianus to his share in the empire from which he had been driven. Valentinianus being soon after slain by secret assassination,  or by some other plot or accident, Theodosius, having again received a response from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and placing entire confidence in it, marched against the tyrant Eugenius, who had been unlawfully elected to succeed that emperor, and defeated his very powerful army, more by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> than by the sword. Some soldiers who were at the battle reported to me that all the missiles they were throwing were snatched from their hands by a vehement wind, which blew from the direction of Theodosius' army upon the enemy; nor did it only drive with greater velocity the darts which were hurled against them, but also turned back upon their own bodies the darts which they themselves were throwing. And therefore the poet Claudian, although an alien from the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nevertheless says in his praises of him, <q>O prince, too much beloved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for you &AElig;olus pours armed tempests from their caves; for you the air fights, and the winds with one accord <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> your bugles.</q>  But the victor, as he had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and predicted, overthrew the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of Jupiter, which had been, as it were, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what kind of <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> against him, and set up in the Alps. And the thunderbolts of these <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, which were made of gold, he mirthfully and graciously presented to his couriers who (as the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the occasion permitted) were jocularly saying that they would be most <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> to be struck by such thunderbolts. The sons of his own enemies, whose fathers had been slain not so much by his orders as by the vehemence of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, having fled for refuge to a church, though they were not yet <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, he was anxious, taking advantage of the occasion, to bring over to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and treated them with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Nor did he deprive them of their property, but, besides allowing them to retain it, bestowed on them additional <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>. He did not permit private animosities to affect the treatment of any man after the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. He was not like Cinna, and Marius, and Sylla, and other such men, who wished not to finish civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> even when they were finished, but rather grieved that they had arisen at all, than wished that when they were finished they should harm any one. Amid all these events, from the very commencement of his reign, he did not cease to help the troubled church against the impious by most just and merciful <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Valens, favoring the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, had vehemently afflicted. Indeed, he rejoiced more to be a member of this church than he did to be a king upon the earth. The <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> he everywhere ordered to be overthrown, understanding well that not even terrestrial gifts are placed in the power of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but in that of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. And what could be more admirable than his religious humility, when, compelled by the urgency of certain of his intimates, he avenged the grievous crime of the Thessalonians, which at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> he had promised to pardon, and, being laid hold of by the discipline of the church, did penance in such a way that the sight of his imperial loftiness prostrated made the people who were interceding for him weep more than the consciousness of offense had made them <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> it when enraged? These and other similar good works, which it would be long to tell, he carried with him from this world of time, where the greatest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> nobility and loftiness are but vapor. Of these works the reward is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the giver, though only to those who are sincerely <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>. But all other blessings and privileges of this life, as the world itself, light, air, earth, water, fruits, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man himself, his body, senses, <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, life, He lavishes on good and bad alike. And among these blessings is also to be reckoned the possession of an empire, whose extent He regulates according to the requirements of His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> government at various times. Whence, I see, we must now answer those who, being confuted and convicted by the most manifest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, by which it is shown that for obtaining these terrestrial things, which are all the foolish desire to have, that multitude of false gods is of no use, attempt to assert that the gods are to be worshipped with a view to the interest, not of the present life, but of that which is to come after death. For as to those who, for the sake of the friendship of this world, are willing to worship vanities, and do not grieve that they are left to their puerile understandings, I think they have been sufficiently answered in these five books; of which books, when I had published the first three, and they had begun to come into the hands of many, I heard that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were preparing against them an answer of some kind or other in writing. Then it was told me that they had already written their answer, but were waiting a time when they could publish it without danger. Such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> I would advise not to desire what cannot be of any advantage to them; for it is very easy for a man to seem to himself to have answered arguments, when he has only been unwilling to be silent. For what is more loquacious than vanity? And though it be able, if it like, to shout more loudly than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it is not, for all that, more powerful than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But let men consider diligently all  the things that we have said, and if, perchance, judging without party spirit, they shall clearly perceive that they are such things as may rather be shaken than torn up by their most impudent garrulity, and, as it were, satirical and mimic levity, let them restrain their absurdities, and let them choose rather to be corrected by the wise than to be lauded by the foolish. For if they are waiting an opportunity, not for liberty to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but for license to revile, may not that befall them which Tully says concerning some one, <q>Oh, wretched man! Who was at liberty to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?</q>  Wherefore, whoever he be who deems himself <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> because of license to revile, he would be far happier if that were not allowed him at all; for he might all the while, laying aside empty boast, be contradicting those to whose views he is opposed by way of free consultation with them, and be listening, as it becomes him, honorably, gravely, candidly, to all that can be adduced by those whom he consults by friendly disputation.</p>
