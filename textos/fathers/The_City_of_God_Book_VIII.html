<h1>The City of God (Book VIII)</h1>

<p class="h1a">Augustine comes now to the third kind of theology, that is, the natural, and takes up the question, whether the worship of the gods of the natural theology is of any avail towards securing blessedness in the life to come. This question he prefers to discuss with the Platonists, because the Platonic system is <q>facile princeps</q> among philosophies, and makes the nearest approximation to Christian truth. In pursuing this argument, he first refutes Apuleius, and all who maintain that the demons should be worshipped as messengers and mediators between gods and men; demonstrating that by no possibility can men be reconciled to good gods by demons, who are the slaves of vice, and who delight in and patronize what good and wise men abhor and condemn&mdash;the blasphemous fictions of poets, theatrical exhibitions, and magical arts.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; That the Question of Natural Theology is to Be Discussed with Those Philosophers Who Sought a More Excellent Wisdom.</h2>

<p>We shall require to apply our mind with far greater intensity to the present question than was requisite in the solution and unfolding of the questions handled in the preceding books; for it is not with ordinary men, but with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> that we must confer concerning the theology which they call natural. For it is not like the fabulous, that is, the theatrical; nor the civil, that is, the urban theology: the one of which displays the crimes of the gods, while the other manifests their criminal desires, which demonstrate them to be rather malign <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> than gods. It is, we say, with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> we have to confer with respect to this theology,&mdash; men whose very name, if rendered into Latin, signifies those who profess the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of wisdom. Now, if wisdom is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made all things, as is attested by the divine authority and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note120296"><a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse24">Wisdom&nbsp;7:24-27</a></span> then the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> is a lover of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But since the thing itself, which is called by this name, exists not in all who <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the name&mdash;for it does not follow, of course, that all who are called <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are lovers of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom&mdash;we must needs select from the number of those with whose opinions we have been able to acquaint ourselves by reading, some with whom we may not unworthily engage in the treatment of this question. For I have not in this work undertaken to refute all the vain opinions of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, but only such as pertain to theology, which Greek word we understand to mean an account or explanation of the divine nature. Nor, again, have I undertaken to refute all the vain theological opinions of all the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, but only of such of them as, agreeing in the belief that there is a divine nature, and that this divine nature is concerned about <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, do nevertheless deny that the worship of the one unchangeable God is sufficient for the obtaining of a blessed life after death, as well as at the present time; and hold that, in order to obtain that life, many gods, created, indeed, and appointed to their several spheres by that one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are to be worshipped. These approach nearer to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> than even Varro; for, while he saw no difficulty in extending natural theology in its entirety even to the world and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the world, these acknowledge God as existing above all that is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and as the Creator not only of this visible world, which is often called heaven and earth, but also of every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> whatsoever, and as Him who gives blessedness to the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash;of which kind is the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash;by participation in His own unchangeable and incorporeal light. There is no one, who has even a slender <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these things, who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a>  <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who derive their name from their master <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. Concerning this <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, then, I will briefly state such things as I deem necessary to the present question, mentioning beforehand those who preceded him in time in the same department of literature.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; Concerning the Two Schools of Philosophers, that Is, the Italic and Ionic, and Their Founders.</h2>

<p>As far as concerns the literature of the Greeks, whose language holds a more illustrious place than any of the languages of the other nations, history mentions two schools of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, the one called the Italic school, originating in that part of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> which was formerly called Magna Gr&aelig;cia; the other called the Ionic school, having its origin in those regions which are still called by the name of Greece. The Italic school had for its founder Pythagoras of Samos, to whom also the term <q><a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a></q> is said to owe its origin. For whereas formerly those who seemed to excel others by the laudable manner in which they regulated their lives were called sages, Pythagoras, on being asked what he professed, replied that he was a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, that is, a student or lover of wisdom; for it seemed to him to be the height of arrogance to profess oneself a sage.  The founder of the Ionic school, again, was Thales of Miletus, one of those seven who were styled the <q>seven sages,</q> of whom six were distinguished by the kind of life they lived, and by certain maxims which they gave forth for the proper conduct of life. Thales was distinguished as an investigator into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things; and, in order that he might have successors in his school, he committed his dissertations to writing. That, however, which especially rendered him eminent was his ability, by means of astronomical calculations, even to predict eclipses of the sun and moon. He thought, however, that water was the first principle of things, and that of it all the elements of the world, the world itself, and all things which are generated in it, ultimately consist. Over all this work, however, which, when we consider the world, appears so admirable, he set nothing of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of divine mind. To him succeeded Anaximander, his pupil, who held a different opinion concerning the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things; for he did not hold that all things spring from one principle, as Thales did, who held that principle to be water, but thought that each thing springs from its own proper principle. These principles of things he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in number, and thought that they generated innumerable worlds, and all the things which arise in them. He thought, also, that these worlds are subject to a perpetual process of alternate dissolution and regeneration, each one continuing for a longer or shorter period of time, according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the case; nor did he, any more than Thales, attribute anything to a divine mind in the production of all this activity of things. Anaximander left as his successor his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> Anaximenes, who attributed all the causes of things to an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> air. He neither denied nor ignored the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of gods, but, so far from believing that the air was made by them, he held, on the contrary, that they sprang from the air. Anaxagoras, however, who was his pupil, perceived that a divine mind was the productive <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things which we see, and said that all the various kinds of things, according to their several modes and species, were produced out of an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> matter consisting of homogeneous particles, but by the efficiency of a divine mind. Diogenes, also, another pupil of Anaximenes, said that a certain air was the original substance of things out of which all things were produced, but that it was possessed of a divine reason, without which nothing could be produced from it. Anaxagoras was succeeded by his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> Archelaus, who also thought that all things consisted of homogeneous particles, of which each particular thing was made, but that those particles were pervaded by a divine <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which perpetually energized all the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> bodies, namely, those particles, so that they are alternately united and separated. Socrates, the master of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, is said to have been the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Archelaus; and on <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> account it is that I have given this brief historical sketch of the whole history of these schools.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; Of the Socratic Philosophy.</h2>

<p>Socrates is said to have been the first who directed the entire effort of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to the correction and regulation of manners, all who went before him having expended their greatest efforts in the investigation of physical, that is, natural phenomena. However, it seems to me that it cannot be certainly discovered whether Socrates did this because he was wearied of obscure and uncertain things, and so wished to direct his mind to the discovery of something manifest and certain, which was necessary in order to the obtaining of a blessed life&mdash;that one great object toward which the labor, vigilance, and industry of all <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> seem to have been directed&mdash;or whether (as some yet more favorable to  him suppose) he did it because he was unwilling that minds defiled with earthly desires should essay to raise themselves upward to divine things. For he saw that the causes of things were sought for by them&mdash;which causes he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be ultimately reducible to nothing else than the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;and on this account he thought they could only be comprehended by a purified mind; and therefore that all diligence ought to be given to the purification of the life by good morals, in order that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, delivered from the depressing weight of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, might raise itself upward by its native vigor to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things, and might, with purified understanding, contemplate that nature which is incorporeal and unchangeable light, where live the causes of all created natures. It is evident, however, that he hunted out and pursued, with a wonderful pleasantness of style and argument, and with a most pointed and insinuating urbanity, the foolishness of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> men, who thought that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this or that&mdash;sometimes confessing his own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and sometimes dissimulating his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, even in those very moral questions to which he seems to have directed the whole force of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. And hence there arose hostility against him, which ended in his being <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniously</a> impeached, and condemned to death. Afterwards, however, that very city of the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>, which had publicly condemned him, did publicly bewail him&mdash;the popular indignation having turned with such vehemence on his accusers, that one of them perished by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the multitude, while the other only escaped a like punishment by <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and perpetual exile.</p>

<p>Illustrious, therefore, both in his life and in his death, Socrates left very many <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, who vied with one another in desire for proficiency in handling those moral questions which concern the chief good (<em>summum bonum</em>), the possession of which can make a man blessed; and because, in the disputations of Socrates, where he raises all manner of questions, makes assertions, and then demolishes them, it did not evidently appear what he held to be the chief good, every one took from these disputations what pleased him best, and every one placed the final good  in whatever it appeared to himself to consist. Now, that which is called the final good is that at which, when one has arrived, he is blessed. But so diverse were the opinions held by those followers of Socrates concerning this final good, that (a thing scarcely to be credited with respect to the followers of one master) some placed the chief good in pleasure, as Aristippus, others in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as Antisthenes. Indeed, it were tedious to recount the various opinions of various <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; Concerning Plato, the Chief Among the Disciples of Socrates, and His Threefold Division of Philosophy.</h2>

<p>But, among the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Socrates, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> was the one who shone with a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which far excelled that of the others, and who not <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> eclipsed them all. By birth, an Athenian of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> parentage, he far surpassed his fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in natural endowments, of which he was possessed in a wonderful degree. Yet, deeming himself and the Socratic discipline far from sufficient for bringing <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to perfection, he travelled as extensively as he was able, going to every place famed for the cultivation of any science of which he could make himself master. Thus he learned from the Egyptians whatever they held and taught as important; and from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, passing into those parts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> which were filled with the fame of the Pythagoreans, he mastered, with the greatest facility, and under the most eminent teachers, all the Italic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which was then in vogue. And, as he had a peculiar <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for his master Socrates, he made him the speaker in all his dialogues, putting into his mouth whatever he had learned, either from others, or from the efforts of his own powerful <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, tempering even his moral disputations with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and politeness of the Socratic style. And, as the study of wisdom consists in action and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, so that one part of it may be called active, and the other contemplative,&mdash; the active part having reference to the conduct of life, that is, to the regulation of morals, and the contemplative part to the investigation into the causes of nature and into pure <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash;Socrates is said to have excelled in the active part of that study, while Pythagoras gave more attention to its contemplative part, on which he brought to bear all the force of his great <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. To <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> is given the praise of having perfected <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> by combining both parts into one. He then divides it into three parts&mdash;the first moral, which is chiefly occupied with action; the second natural, of which the object is <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>; and the third rational, which discriminates between the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and the false. And though this last is necessary both to action and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, nevertheless, which lays peculiar claim to the office of investigating the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Thus  this tripartite division is not contrary to that which made the study of wisdom to consist in action and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Now, as to what <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> thought with respect to each of these parts&mdash;that is, what he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be the end of all actions, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all natures, and the light of all intelligences&mdash;it would be a question too long to discuss, and about which we ought not to make any rash affirmation. For, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> liked and constantly affected the well-known method of his master Socrates, namely, that of dissimulating his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or his opinions, it is not easy to discover clearly what he himself thought on various matters, any more than it is to discover what were the real opinions of Socrates. We must, nevertheless, insert into our work certain of those opinions which he expresses in his writings, whether he himself uttered them, or narrates them as expressed by others, and seems himself to approve of&mdash;opinions sometimes favorable to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, which our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> takes up and defends, and sometimes contrary to it, as, for example, in the questions concerning the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of one God or of many, as it relates to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> blessed life which is to be after death. For those who are praised as having most closely followed <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> preferred to all the other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and who are said to have manifested the greatest acuteness in understanding him, do perhaps entertain such an idea of God as to admit that in Him are to be found the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, the ultimate reason for the understanding, and the end in reference to which the whole life is to be regulated. Of which three things, the first is understood to pertain to the natural, the second to the rational, and the third to the moral part of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. For if man has been so created as to attain, through that which is most excellent in him, to that which excels all things&mdash;that is, to the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and absolutely good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without whom no nature exists, no doctrine instructs, no exercise profits&mdash;let Him be sought in whom all things are secure to us, let Him be discovered in whom all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> becomes certain to us, let Him be loved in whom all becomes right to us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; That It is Especially with the Platonists that We Must Carry on Our Disputations on Matters of Theology, Their Opinions Being Preferable to Those of All Other Philosophers.</h2>

<p>If, then, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> defined the wise man as one who imitates, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, loves this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who is rendered blessed through fellowship with Him in His own blessedness, why discuss with the other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>? It is evident that none come nearer to us than the Platonists. To them, therefore, let that fabulous theology give place which delights the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with the crimes of the gods; and that civil theology also, in which impure <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, under the name of gods, have seduced the peoples of the earth given up to earthly pleasures, desiring to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and by filling the minds of their worshippers with impure desires, exciting them to make the representation of their crimes one of the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of their worship, while they themselves found in the spectators of these exhibitions a most pleasing spectacle,&mdash; a theology in which, whatever was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> in the temple, was defiled by its mixture with the obscenity of the theatre, and whatever was base in the theatre was vindicated by the abominations of the temples. To these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> also the interpretations of Varro must give place, in which he explains the sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> as having reference to heaven and earth, and to the seeds and operations of perishable things; for, in the first place, those <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> have not the signification which he would have men <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is attached to them, and therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> does not follow him in his attempt so to interpret them; and even if they had this signification, still those things ought not to be worshipped by the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as its god which are placed below it in the scale of nature, nor ought the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to prefer to itself as gods things to which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God has given it the preference. The same must be said of those writings pertaining to the sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, which Numa Pompilius took care to conceal by causing them to be buried along with himself, and which, when they were afterwards turned up by the plough, were burned by order of the senate. And, to treat Numa with all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, let us mention as belonging to the same rank as these writings that which Alexander of Macedon wrote to his mother as communicated to him by Leo, an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>. In this letter not only Picus and Faunus, and &AElig;neas and Romulus or even Hercules, and &AElig;sculapius and Liber, born of Semele, and the twin sons of Tyndareus, or any other mortals who have been deified, but even the principal gods themselves,  to whom Cicero, in his Tusculan questions,  alludes without mentioning their names, Jupiter, Juno, Saturn, Vulcan, Vesta, and many others whom Varro attempts to identify with the parts or the elements of the world, are shown to have been men. There is, as we have said, a similarity between this case  and that of Numa; for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> being afraid because he had revealed a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, earnestly begged of Alexander to command his mother to burn the letter which conveyed these communications to her. Let these two theologies, then, the fabulous and the civil, give place to the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who have recognized the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God as the author of all things, the source of the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the bountiful bestower of all blessedness. And not these only, but to these great acknowledgers of so great a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, those <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> must yield who, having their mind enslaved to their body, supposed the principles of all things to be material; as Thales, who held that the first principle of all things was water; Anaximenes, that it was air; the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, that it was fire; <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, who affirmed that it consisted of atoms, that is to say, of minute corpuscules; and many others whom it is needless to enumerate, but who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that bodies, simple or compound, animate or inanimate, but nevertheless bodies, were the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and principle of all things. For some of them&mdash; as, for instance, the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>&mdash; <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that living things could originate from things without life; others held that all things living or without life spring from a living principle, but that, nevertheless, all things, being material, spring from a material principle. For the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> thought that fire, that is, one of the four material elements of which this visible world is composed, was both living and intelligent, the maker of the world and of all things contained in it&mdash;that it was in fact God. These and others like them have only been able to suppose that which their hearts enslaved to sense have vainly suggested to them. And yet they have within themselves something which they could not see: they represented to themselves inwardly things which they had seen without, even when they were not seeing them, but only thinking of them. But this representation in thought is no longer a body, but only the similitude of a body; and that faculty of the mind by which this similitude of a body is seen is neither a body nor the similitude of a body; and the faculty which judges whether the representation is beautiful or ugly is without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> superior to the object judged of. This principle is the understanding of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and it is certainly not a body, since that similitude of a body which it beholds and judges of is itself not a body. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is neither earth, nor water, nor air, nor fire, of which four bodies, called the four elements, we see that this world is composed. And if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not a body, how should <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, its Creator, be a body? Let all those <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, then, give place, as we have said, to the Platonists, and those also who have been ashamed to say that God is a body, but yet have thought that our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are of the same nature as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They have not been staggered by the great changeableness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash;an attribute which it would be impious to ascribe to the divine nature,&mdash; but they say it is the body which changes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for in itself it is unchangeable. As well might they say, <q>Flesh is wounded by some body, for in itself it is invulnerable.</q> In a word, that which is unchangeable can be changed by nothing, so that that which can be changed by the body cannot properly be said to be immutable.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; Concerning the Meaning of the Platonists in that Part of Philosophy Called Physical.</h2>

<p>These <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, then, whom we see not undeservedly exalted above the rest in fame and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, have seen that no material body is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore they have transcended all bodies in seeking for God. They have seen that whatever is changeable is not the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore they have transcended every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and all changeable spirits in seeking the supreme. They have seen also that, in every changeable thing, the form which makes it that which it is, whatever be its mode or nature, can only <em>be</em> through Him who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <em>is</em>, because He is unchangeable. And therefore, whether we consider the whole body of the world, its figure, qualities, and orderly movement, and also all the bodies which are in it; or whether we consider all life, either that which nourishes and maintains, as the life of trees, or that which, besides this, has also sensation, as the life of beasts; or that which adds to all these intelligence, as the life of man; or that which does not need the support of nutriment, but only maintains, feels, understands, as the life of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>&mdash;all can only <em>be</em> through Him who absolutely <em> is</em>. For to Him it is not one thing to <em>be</em>, and another to live, as though He could <em>be</em>, not living; nor is it to Him one thing to live, and another thing to understand, as though He could live, not understanding; nor is it to Him one thing to understand, another thing to be blessed, as though He could understand and not be blessed. But to Him to live, to understand, to be blessed, are to <em>be</em>. They have understood, from this unchangeableness and this simplicity, that all things must have been made by Him, and that He could Himself have been made by none. For they have considered that whatever <em>is</em> is either body or life, and that life is something better than body, and that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of body is sensible,  and that of life intelligible. Therefore they have preferred the intelligible nature to the sensible. We mean by sensible things such things as can be perceived by the sight and touch of the body; by intelligible things, such as can be understood by the sight of the mind. For there is no corporeal beauty, whether in the condition of a body, as figure, or in its movement, as in music, of which it is not the mind that judges. But this could never have been, had there not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the mind itself a superior form of these things, without bulk, without noise of voice, without space and time. But even in respect of these things, had the mind not been mutable, it would not have been possible for one to judge better than another with regard to sensible forms. He who is clever, judges better than he who is slow, he who is skilled than he who is unskillful, he who is practised than he who is unpractised; and the same person judges better after he has gained experience than he did before. But that which is capable of more and less is mutable; whence able men, who have thought deeply on these things, have gathered that the first form is not to be found in those things whose form is changeable. Since, therefore, they saw that body and mind might be more or less beautiful in form, and that, if they wanted form, they could have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, they saw that there is some <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in which is the first form, unchangeable, and therefore not admitting of degrees of comparison, and in that they most rightly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> was the first principle of things which was not made, and by which all things were made. Therefore that which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of God He manifested to them when His invisible things were seen by them, being understood by those things which have been made; also His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power and Godhead by whom all visible and temporal things have been created. <span class="stiki" id="note120301"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;1:19-20</a></span> We have said enough upon that part of theology which they call physical, that is, natural.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; How Much the Platonists are to Be Held as Excelling Other Philosophers in Logic, i.e. Rational Philosophy.</h2>

<p>Then, again, as far as regards the doctrine which treats of that which they call logic, that is, rational <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, far be it from us to compare them with those who attributed to the bodily senses the faculty of discriminating <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and thought, that all we learn is to be measured by their untrustworthy and fallacious rules. Such were the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>, and all of the same school. Such also were the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, who ascribed to the bodily senses that expertness in disputation which they so ardently <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, called by them dialectic, asserting that from the senses the mind conceives the notions (<span class="greek">&#x1F12;&#x03BD;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) of those things which they explicate by definition. And hence is developed the whole plan and connection of their learning and teaching. I often wonder, with respect to this, how they can say that none are beautiful but the wise; for by what bodily sense have they perceived that beauty, by what eyes of the flesh have they seen wisdom's comeliness of form? Those, however, whom we <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> rank before all others, have distinguished those things which are conceived by the mind from those which are perceived by the senses, neither taking away from the senses anything to which they are competent, nor attributing to them anything beyond their competency. And the light of our understandings, by which all things are learned by us, they have affirmed to be that selfsame God by whom all things were made.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; That the Platonists Hold the First Rank in Moral Philosophy Also.</h2>

<p>The remaining part of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is morals, or what is called by the Greeks <span class="greek">&#x1F20;&#x03B8;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F75;</span>, in which is discussed the question concerning the chief good&mdash;that which will leave us nothing further to seek in order to be blessed, if only we make all our actions refer to it, and seek it not for the sake of something else, but for its own sake. Therefore it is called the end, because we wish other things on account of it, but itself only for its own sake. This beatific good, therefore, according to some, comes to a man from the body, according to others, from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and, according to others, from both together. For they saw that man himself consists of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body; and therefore they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that from either of these two, or from both together, their well-being must proceed, consisting in a certain final good, which could render them blessed, and to which they might refer all their actions, not requiring anything ulterior to which to refer that good itself. This is why those who have added a third kind of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, which they call extrinsic&mdash;as <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and the like&mdash;have not regarded them as part of the final good, that is, to be sought after for their own sake, but as things which are to be sought for the sake of something else, affirming that this kind of good is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the good, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Wherefore, whether they have sought the good of man from the mind or from the body, or from both together, it is still only from man  they have supposed that it must be sought. But they who have sought it from the body have sought it from the inferior part of man; they who have sought it from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, from the superior part; and they who have sought it from both, from the whole man. Whether therefore, they have sought it from any part, or from the whole man, still they have only sought it from man; nor have these differences, being three, given rise only to three dissentient <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, but to many. For diverse <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have held diverse opinions, both concerning the good of the body, and the good of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and the good of both together. Let, therefore, all these give place to those <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who have not affirmed that a man is blessed by the enjoyment of the body, or by the enjoyment of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but by the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;enjoying Him, however, not as the mind does the body or itself, or as one friend enjoys another, but as the eye enjoys light, if, indeed, we may draw any comparison between these things. But what the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of this comparison is, will, if God help me, be shown in another place, to the best of my ability. At present, it is sufficient to mention that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> determined the final good to be to live according to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and affirmed that he only can attain to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and imitates <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and imitation are the only <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of blessedness. Therefore he did not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that to philosophize is to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose nature is incorporeal. Whence it certainly follows that the student of wisdom, that is, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, will then become blessed when he shall have begun to enjoy God. For though he is not necessarily blessed who enjoys that which he loves (for many are miserable by loving that which ought not to be loved, and still more miserable when they enjoy it), nevertheless no one is blessed who does not enjoy that which he loves. For even they who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> things which ought not to be loved do not count themselves blessed by loving merely, but by enjoying them. Who, then, but the most miserable will deny that he is blessed, who enjoys that which he loves, and loves the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and highest good? But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and highest good, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore he would call him a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> who loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is directed to the obtaining of the blessed life, and he who loves God is <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; Concerning that Philosophy Which Has Come Nearest to the Christian Faith.</h2>

<p>Whatever <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, therefore, thought concerning the supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He is both the maker of all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, the light by which things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and the good in reference to which things are to be done; that we have in Him the first principle of nature, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of doctrine, and the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of life&mdash;whether these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> may be more suitably called Platonists, or whether they may give some other name to their <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>; whether, we say, that only the chief men of the Ionic school, such as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> himself, and they who have well understood him, have thought thus; or whether we also include the Italic school, on account of Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans, and all who may have held like opinions; and, lastly, whether also we include all who have been held wise men and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> among all nations who are discovered to have seen and taught this, be they Atlantics, Libyans, Egyptians, Indians, Persians, Chaldeans, Scythians, Gauls, Spaniards, or of other nations&mdash;we prefer these to all other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and confess that they approach nearest to us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; That the Excellency of the Christian Religion is Above All the Science of Philosophers.</h2>

<p>For although a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man instructed only in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> literature may perhaps be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the very name of Platonists, and may not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> two schools of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> speaking the Greek tongue, to wit, the Ionic and Italic, he is nevertheless not so deaf with respect to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, as not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> profess the study, and even the possession, of wisdom. He is on his guard, however, with respect to those who philosophize according to the elements of this world, not according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whom the world itself was made; for he is warned by the precept of the apostle, and faithfully hears what has been said, <q>Beware that no one deceive you through <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain deceit, according to the elements of the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120302"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse8">Colossians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> Then, that he may not suppose that all <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are such as do this, he hears the same apostle say concerning certain of them, <q>Because that which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested it to them. For His invisible things from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things which are made, also His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power and Godhead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120303"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;1:19-20</a></span> And, when speaking to the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>, after having spoken a mighty thing concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which few are able to understand, <q>In Him we live, and  move, and have our being,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120304"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse28">Acts&nbsp;17:28</a></span> he goes on to say, <q>As certain also of your own have said.</q> He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> well, too, to be on his guard against even these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> in their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. For where it has been said by him, <q>that God has manifested to them by those things which are made His invisible things, that they might be seen by the understanding,</q> there it has also been said that they did not rightly worship God Himself, because they paid divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, which are due to Him alone, to other things also to which they ought not to have paid them&mdash;<q>because, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him not as God: neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of corruptible man, and of birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120305"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;1:21-23</a></span> &mdash; where the apostle would have us understand him as meaning the Romans, and Greeks, and Egyptians, who gloried in the name of wisdom; but concerning this we will dispute with them afterwards. With respect, however, to that wherein they agree with us we prefer them to all others namely, concerning the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the author of this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, who is not only above every body, being incorporeal, but also above all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, being incorruptible&mdash; our principle, our light, our good. And though the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man, being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of their writings, does not use in disputation words which he has not learned&mdash;not calling that part of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> natural (which is the Latin term), or physical (which is the Greek one), which treats of the investigation of nature; or that part rational, or <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>, which deals with the question how <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may be discovered; or that part moral, or ethical, which concerns morals, and shows how good is to be sought, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be shunned&mdash;he is not, therefore, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that it is from the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and supremely good God that we have that nature in which we are made in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that doctrine by which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him and ourselves, and that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through which, by cleaving to Him, we are blessed. This, therefore, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why we prefer these to all the others, because, while other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have worn out their minds and powers in seeking the causes of things, and endeavoring to discover the right mode of learning and of living, these, by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have found where resides the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> by which the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> has been constituted, and the light by which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is to be discovered, and the fountain at which felicity is to be drunk. All <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, then, who have had these thoughts concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whether Platonists or others, agree with us. But we have thought it better to plead our <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> with the Platonists, because their writings are better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For the Greeks, whose tongue holds the highest place among the languages of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, are loud in their praises of these writings; and the Latins, taken with their excellence, or their renown, have studied them more heartily than other writings, and, by translating them into our tongue, have given them greater celebrity and notoriety.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; How Plato Has Been Able to Approach So Nearly to Christian Knowledge.</h2>

<p>Certain partakers with us in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, wonder when they hear and read that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> had conceptions concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in which they recognize considerable agreement with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of our religion. Some have concluded from this, that when he went to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> he had heard the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah, or, while travelling in the same country, had read the prophetic scriptures, which opinion I myself have expressed in certain of my writings.  But a careful calculation of dates, contained in chronological history, shows that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> was born about a hundred years after the time in which Jeremiah prophesied, and, as he lived eighty-one years, there are found to have been about seventy years from his death to that time when Ptolemy, king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, requested the prophetic scriptures of the Hebrew people to be sent to him from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and committed them to seventy Hebrews, who also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the Greek tongue, to be translated and kept. Therefore, on that voyage of his, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> could neither have seen Jeremiah, who was dead so long before, nor have read those same scriptures which had not yet been translated into the Greek language, of which he was a master, unless, indeed, we say that, as he was most earnest in the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he also studied those writings through an interpreter, as he did those of the Egyptians,&mdash; not, indeed, writing a translation of them (the facilities for doing which were only gained even by Ptolemy in return for munificent acts of kindness,  though <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of his kingly authority might have seemed a sufficient motive), but learning as much as he possibly could concerning their contents by means of conversation. What warrants this supposition are the  opening verses of Genesis: <q>In the beginning God made the heaven and earth. &nbsp;And the earth was invisible, and without order; and darkness was over the abyss: and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> moved over the waters.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120308"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;1:1-2</a></span> For in the <em>Tim&aelig;us</em>, when writing on the formation of the world, he says that God first united earth and fire; from which it is evident that he assigns to fire a place in heaven. This opinion bears a certain resemblance to the statement, <q>In the beginning God made heaven and earth.</q> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> next speaks of those two intermediary elements, water and air, by which the other two extremes, namely, earth and fire, were mutually united; from which circumstance he is thought to have so understood the words, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> moved over the waters.</q> For, not paying sufficient attention to the designations given by those scriptures to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, he may have thought that the four elements are spoken of in that place, because the air also is called spirit.  Then, as to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> saying that the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> is a lover of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nothing shines forth more conspicuously in those sacred writings. But the most striking thing in this connection, and that which most of all inclines me almost to assent to the opinion that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of those writings, is the answer which was given to the question elicited from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> when the words of God were conveyed to him by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; for, when he asked what was the name of that God who was commanding him to go and deliver the Hebrew people out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, this answer was given: <q>I am who am; and you shall say to the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, He who <em>is</em> sent me unto you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120310"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;3:14</a></span> as though compared with Him that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <em>is</em>, because He is unchangeable, those things which have been created mutable <em>are</em> not&mdash;a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> held, and most diligently commended. And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether this sentiment is anywhere to be found in the books of those who were before <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, unless in that book where it is said, <q>I am who am; and you shall say to the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <em>who is</em> sent me unto you.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; That Even the Platonists, Though They Say These Things Concerning the One True God, Nevertheless Thought that Sacred Rites Were to Be Performed in Honor of Many Gods.</h2>

<p>But we need not determine from what source he learned these things&mdash;whether it was from the books of the ancients who preceded him, or, as is more likely, from the words of the apostle: <q>Because that which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has been manifested among them, for God has manifested it to them. For His invisible things from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by those things which have been made, also His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power and Godhead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120311"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;1:20</a></span> From whatever source he may have derived this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, then, I think I have made it sufficiently plain that I have not chosen the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> undeservedly as the parties with whom to discuss; because the question we have just taken up concerns the natural theology,&mdash; the question, namely, whether sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> are to be performed to one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or to many, for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which is to be after death. I have specially chosen them because their juster thoughts concerning the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> who made heaven and earth, have made them illustrious among <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. This has given them such superiority to all others in the judgment of posterity, that, though Aristotle, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, a man of eminent abilities, inferior in eloquence to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, yet far superior to many in that respect, had founded the Peripatetic <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>&mdash;so called because they were in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of walking about during their disputations&mdash;and though he had, through the greatness of his fame, gathered very many <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> into his school, even during the life of his master; and though <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> at his death was succeeded in his school, which was called the Academy, by Speusippus, his sister's son, and Xenocrates, his beloved <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, who, together with their successors, were called from this name of the school, Academics; nevertheless the most illustrious recent <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who have chosen to follow <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, have been unwilling to be called Peripatetics, or Academics, but have preferred the name of Platonists. Among these were the renowned Plotinus, Iamblichus, and Porphyry, who were Greeks, and the African Apuleius, who was learned both in the Greek and Latin tongues. All these, however, and the rest who were of the same school, and also <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> himself, thought that sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> ought to be performed in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of many gods.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; Concerning the Opinion of Plato, According to Which He Defined the Gods as Beings Entirely Good and the Friends of Virtue.</h2>

<p>Therefore, although in many other important respects they differ from us, nevertheless with respect to this particular point of difference, which I have just stated, as it is one of  great moment, and the question on hand concerns it, I will first ask them to what gods they think that sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> are to be performed&mdash;to the good or to the bad, or to both the good and the bad? But we have the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> affirming that all the gods are good, and that there is not one of the gods bad. It follows, therefore, that these are to be performed to the good, for then they are performed to gods; for if they are not good, neither are they gods. Now, if this be the case (for what else ought we to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> concerning the gods?), certainly it explodes the opinion that the bad gods are to be propitiated by sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> in order that they may not harm us, but the good gods are to be invoked in order that they may assist us. For there are no bad gods, and it is to the good that, as they say, the due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of such <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> is to be paid. Of what character, then, are those gods who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> scenic displays, even demanding that a place be given them among divine things, and that they be exhibited in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>? The power of these gods proves that they exist, but their liking such things proves that they are bad. For it is well-known what <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> opinion was concerning scenic plays. He thinks that the poets themselves, because they have composed songs so unworthy of the majesty and goodness of the gods, ought to be banished from the state. Of what character, therefore, are those gods who contend with <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> himself about those scenic plays? He does not suffer the gods to be defamed by false crimes; the gods command those same crimes to be celebrated in their own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.</p>

<p>In fine, when they ordered these plays to be inaugurated, they not only demanded base things, but also did cruel things, taking from Titus Latinius his son, and sending a disease upon him because he had refused to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> them, which they removed when he had fulfilled their commands. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, however, bad though they were, did not think they were to be feared; but, holding to his opinion with the utmost firmness and constancy, does not hesitate to remove from a well-ordered state all the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> follies of the poets, with which these gods are delighted because they themselves are impure. But Labeo places this same <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> (as I have mentioned already in the second book ) among the demi-gods. Now Labeo thinks that the bad deities are to be propitiated with bloody victims, and by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> accompanied with the same, but the good deities with plays, and all other things which are associated with joyfulness. How comes it, then, that the demi-god <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> so persistently dares to take away those pleasures, because he deems them base, not from the demi-gods but from the gods, and these the good gods? And, moreover, those very gods themselves do certainly refute the opinion of Labeo, for they showed themselves in the case of Latinius to be not only wanton and sportive, but also cruel and terrible. Let the Platonists, therefore, explain these things to us, since, following the opinion of their master, they think that all the gods are good and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a>, and friendly to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the wise, holding it unlawful to think otherwise concerning any of the gods. We will explain it, say they. Let us then attentively listen to them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; Of the Opinion of Those Who Have Said that Rational Souls are of Three Kinds, to Wit, Those of the Celestial Gods, Those of the Aerial Demons, and Those of Terrestrial Men.</h2>

<p>There is, say they, a threefold division of all animals endowed with a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, namely, into gods, men, and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. The gods occupy the loftiest region, men the lowest, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> the middle region. For the abode of the gods is heaven, that of men the earth, that of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> the air. As the dignity of their regions is diverse, so also is that of their natures; therefore the gods are better than men and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Men have been placed below the gods and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, both in respect of the order of the regions they inhabit, and the difference of their merits. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, therefore, who hold the middle place, as they are inferior to the gods, than whom they inhabit a lower region, so they are superior to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, than whom they inhabit a loftier one. For they have <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of body in common with the gods, but <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the mind in common with men. On which account, say they, it is not wonderful that they are delighted with the obscenities of the theatre, and the fictions of the poets, since they are also subject to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, from which the gods are far removed, and to which they are altogether strangers. Whence we conclude that it was not the gods, who are all good and highly exalted, that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> deprived of the pleasure of theatric plays, by reprobating and prohibiting the fictions of the poets, but the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</p>

<p>Of these things many have written: among others Apuleius, the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> of Madaura, who composed a whole work on the subject, entitled, <em>Concerning the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Socrates</em>. He there discusses and explains of what kind that deity was who attended on Socrates, a sort of familiar, by whom it is said he was admonished  to desist from any action which would not turn out to his advantage. He asserts most distinctly, and proves at great length, that it was not a god but a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>; and he discusses with great diligence the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> concerning the lofty estate of the gods, the lowly estate of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the middle estate of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. These things being so, how did <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> dare to take away, if not from the gods, whom he removed from all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> contagion, certainly from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, all the pleasures of the theatre, by expelling the poets from the state? Evidently in this way he wished to admonish the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, although still confined in these moribund members, to despise the shameful commands of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and to detest their impurity, and to choose rather the splendor of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But if <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> showed himself <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> in answering and prohibiting these things, then certainly it was shameful of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> to command them. Therefore either Apuleius is wrong, and Socrates' familiar did not belong to this class of deities, or <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> held contradictory opinions, now honoring the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, now removing from the well-regulated state the things in which they delighted, or Socrates is not to be congratulated on the friendship of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, of which Apuleius was so ashamed that he entitled his book <em>On the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Socrates</em>, while according to the tenor of his discussion, wherein he so diligently and at such length distinguishes gods from <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, he ought not to have entitled it, <em>Concerning the God</em>, but <em> Concerning the Demon of Socrates</em>. But he preferred to put this into the discussion itself rather than into the title of his book. For, through the sound doctrine which has illuminated <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society, all, or almost all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have such a horror at the name of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, that every one who before reading the dissertation of Apuleius, which sets forth the dignity of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, should have read the title of the book, <em>On the Demon of Socrates</em>, would certainly have thought that the author was not a sane man. But what did even Apuleius find to praise in the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, except subtlety and strength of body and a higher place of habitation? For when he spoke generally concerning their manners, he said nothing that was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but very much that was bad. Finally, no one, when he has read that book, wonders that they desired to have even the obscenity of the stage among divine things, or that, wishing to be thought gods, they should be delighted with the crimes of the gods, or that all those sacred solemnities, whose obscenity occasions laughter, and whose shameful cruelty causes horror, should be in agreement with their <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; That the Demons are Not Better Than Men Because of Their Aerial Bodies, or on Account of Their Superior Place of Abode.</h2>

<p>Wherefore let not the mind <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> religious, and submitted to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, suppose that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are better than men, because they have better bodies. Otherwise it must put many beasts before itself which are superior to us both in acuteness of the senses, in ease and quickness of movement, in strength and in long-continued vigor of body. What man can equal the eagle or the vulture in strength of vision? Who can equal the dog in acuteness of smell? Who can equal the hare, the stag, and all the birds in swiftness? Who can equal in strength the lion or the elephant? Who can equal in length of life the serpents, which are affirmed to put off old age along with their skin, and to return to youth again? But as we are better than all these by the possession of reason and understanding, so we ought also to be better than the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by living good and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> lives. For <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> gave to them bodies of a better quality than ours, that that in which we excel them might in this way be commended to us as deserving to be far more cared for than the body, and that we should learn to despise the bodily excellence of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> compared with goodness of life, in respect of which we are better than they, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that we too shall have <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of body&mdash;not an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> tortured by <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, but that which is consequent on purity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>But now, as regards loftiness of place, it is altogether ridiculous to be so influenced by the fact that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> inhabit the air, and we the earth, as to think that on that account they are to be put before us; for in this way we put all the birds before ourselves. But the birds, when they are weary with flying, or require to repair their bodies with food, come back to the earth to rest or to feed, which the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, they say, do not. Are they, therefore, inclined to say that the birds are superior to us, and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> superior to the birds? But if it be <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> to think so, there is no reason why we should think that, on account of their inhabiting a loftier element, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have a claim to our religious submission. But as it is really the case that the birds of the air are not only not put before us who dwell on the earth; but are even subjected to us on account of the dignity of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is in us, so also it is the case that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, though they are aerial, are not better than we who are terrestrial because the air is higher than the  earth, but, on the contrary, men are to be put before <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> because their despair is not to be compared to the hope of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men. Even that law of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a>, according to which he mutually orders and arranges the four elements, inserting between the two extreme elements&mdash; namely, fire, which is in the highest degree mobile, and the immoveable earth&mdash; the two middle ones, air and water, that by how much the air is higher up than the water, and the fire than the air, by so much also are the waters higher than the earth&mdash;this law, I say, sufficiently admonishes us not to estimate the merits of animated creatures according to the grades of the elements. And Apuleius himself says that man is a terrestrial animal in common with the rest, who is nevertheless to be put far before aquatic animals, though <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> puts the waters themselves before the land. By this he would have us understand that the same order is not to be observed when the question concerns the merits of animals, though it seems to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one in the gradation of bodies; for it appears to be possible that a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a higher order may inhabit a body of a lower, and a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a lower order a body of a higher.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; What Apuleius the Platonist Thought Concerning the Manners and Actions of Demons.</h2>

<p>The same Apuleius, when speaking concerning the manners of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, said that they are agitated with the same perturbations of mind as men; that they are provoked by injuries, propitiated by services and by gifts, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, are delighted with a variety of sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, and are annoyed if any of them be neglected. Among other things, he also says that on them depend the divinations of augurs, soothsayers, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the revelations of dreams, and that from them also are the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the magicians. But, when giving a brief definition of them, he says, <q>Demons are of an animal nature, passive in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, rational in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, aerial in body, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in time.</q> <q>Of which five things, the three first are common to them and us, the fourth peculiar to themselves, and the fifth common to therewith the gods.</q>  But I see that they have in common with the gods two of the first things, which they have in common with us. For he says that the gods also are animals; and when he is assigning to every order of beings its own element, he places us among the other terrestrial animals which live and feel upon the earth. Wherefore, if the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are animals as to genus, this is common to them, not only with men, but also with the gods and with beasts; if they are rational as to their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, this is common to them with the gods and with men; if they are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in time, this is common to them with the gods only; if they are passive as to their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, this is common to them with men only; if they are aerial in body, in this they are alone. Therefore it is no great thing for them to be of an animal nature, for so also are the beasts; in being rational as to <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, they are not above ourselves, for so are we also; and as to their being <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> as to time, what is the advantage of that if they are not blessed? For better is temporal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> than <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> misery. Again, as to their being passive in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, how are they in this respect above us, since we also are so, but would not have been so had we not been miserable? Also, as to their being aerial in body, how much value is to be set on that, since a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of any kind whatsoever is to be set above every body? And therefore religious worship, which ought to be rendered from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is by no means due to that thing which is inferior to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Moreover, if he had, among those things which he says belong to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, enumerated <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, wisdom, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and affirmed that they have those things in common with the gods, and, like them, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, he would assuredly have attributed to them something greatly to be desired, and much to be prized. And even in that case it would not have been our duty to worship them like God on account of these things, but rather to worship Him from whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> they had received them. But how much less are they really worthy of divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>&mdash;those aerial animals who are only rational that they may be capable of misery, passive that they may be actually miserable, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> that it may be impossible for them to end their misery!</p>

<p>Wherefore, to omit other things, and confine our attention to that which he says is common to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> with us, let us ask this question: If all the four elements are full of their own animals, the fire and the air of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and the water and the earth of mortal ones, why are the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> agitated by the whirlwinds and tempests of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>?&mdash; for the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span> means perturbation, whence he chose to call the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> <q>passive in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,</q> because the word passion,  which is derived from <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x1F71;&#x03B8;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>, signified a commotion of the mind contrary to reason. Why, then, are these things in the minds of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> which are not in beasts? For if anything of this kind appears in beasts, it is not perturbation, because it is not contrary to reason, of which they are devoid. Now it is foolishness or misery which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of these perturbations in the case of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for we are not yet <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the possession of that perfection of wisdom which is promised to us at last, when we shall be set free from our present mortality. But the gods, they say, are free from these perturbations, because they are not only <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, but also blessed; for they also have the same kind of rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, but most pure from all spot and plague. Wherefore, if the gods are free from perturbation because they are blessed, not miserable animals, and the beasts are free from them because they are animals which are capable neither of blessedness nor misery, it remains that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, like men, are subject to perturbations because they are not blessed but miserable animals. What folly, therefore, or rather what <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, to submit ourselves through any sentiment of religion to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, when it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion to deliver us from that depravity which makes us like to them! For Apuleius himself, although he is very sparing toward them, and thinks they are worthy of divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, is nevertheless compelled to confess that they are subject to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion commands us not to be moved with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but rather to resist it. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are won over by gifts; and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion commands us to favor no one on account of gifts received. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are flattered by <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion commands us by no means to be moved by such things. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are haters of some men and lovers of others, not in consequence of a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> and calm judgment, but because of what he calls their <q>passive <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>;</q> whereas the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion commands us to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> even our enemies. Lastly, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion commands us to put away all disquietude of heart and agitation of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and also all commotions and tempests of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which Apuleius asserts to be continually swelling and surging in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Why, therefore, except through foolishness and miserable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> should you <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> yourself to worship a being to whom you desire to be unlike in your life? And why should you pay religious homage to him whom you are unwilling to imitate, when it is the highest duty of religion to imitate Him whom you worship?</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; What Kind of Religion that is Which Teaches that Men Ought to Employ the Advocacy of Demons in Order to Be Recommended to the Favor of the Good Gods.</h2>

<p>In vain, therefore, have Apuleius, and they who think with him, conferred on the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of placing them in the air, between the ethereal heavens and the earth, that they may carry to the gods the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to men the answers of the gods: for <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> held, they say, that no god has intercourse with man. They who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> these things have thought it unbecoming that men should have intercourse with the gods, and the gods with men, but a befitting thing that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> should have intercourse with both gods and men, presenting to the gods the petitions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and conveying to men what the gods have granted; so that a chaste man, and one who is a stranger to the crimes of the magic arts, must use as patrons, through whom the gods may be induced to hear him, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> these crimes, although the very fact of his not loving them ought to have recommended him to them as one who deserved to be listened to with greater readiness and willingness on their part. They <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the abominations of the stage, which <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. They <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, in the sorceries of the magicians, <q> <em>a thousand arts of inflicting harm</em>,</q>  which innocence does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Yet both <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and innocence, if they wish to obtain anything from the gods, will not be able to do so by their own merits, except their enemies act as mediators on their behalf. Apuleius need not attempt to justify the fictions of the poets, and the mockeries of the stage. If <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> modesty can act so faithlessly towards itself as not only to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> shameful things, but even to think that they are pleasing to the divinity, we can cite on the other side their own highest authority and teacher, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; Of the Impiety of the Magic Art, Which is Dependent on the Assistance of Malign Spirits.</h2>

<p>Moreover, against those magic arts, concerning which some men, exceedingly wretched and exceedingly impious, delight to boast, may not public opinion itself be brought forward as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>? For why are those arts so severely punished by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, if they are the works of deities who ought to be worshipped? Shall it be said that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> have or  dained those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> by which magic arts are punished? With what other meaning, except that these sorceries are without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> pernicious to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, did the most illustrious poet say,</p>

<blockquote><p>By heaven, I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, and your dear life,<br>
Unwillingly these arms I wield,<br>
And take, to meet the coming strife,<br>
Enchantment's sword and shield. <br>
And that also which he says in another place concerning magic arts,<br>
<q>I've seen him to another place transport the standing grain,</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>has reference to the fact that the fruits of one field are said to be transferred to another by these arts which this pestiferous and accursed doctrine teaches. Does not Cicero inform us that, among the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Twelve Tables, that is, the most ancient <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Romans, there was a law written which appointed a punishment to be inflicted on him who should do this?  Lastly, was it before <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> judges that Apuleius himself was accused of magic arts?  Had he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> these arts to be divine and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and congruous with the works of divine power, he ought not only to have confessed, but also to have professed them, rather blaming the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> by which these things were prohibited and pronounced worthy of condemnation, while they ought to have been held worthy of admiration and respect. For by so doing, either he would have persuaded the judges to adopt his own opinion, or, if they had shown their partiality for <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and condemned him to death notwithstanding his praising and commending such things, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> would have bestowed on his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> such rewards as he deserved, who, in order to proclaim and set forth their divine works, had not feared the loss of his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. As our <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, when that religion was charged on them as a crime, by which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> they were made safe and most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> throughout <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, did not choose, by denying it, to escape temporal punishments, but rather by confessing, professing, and proclaiming it, by enduring all things for it with fidelity and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and by dying for it with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> calmness, put to shame the law by which that religion was prohibited, and caused its revocation. But there is extant a most copious and eloquent oration of this <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, in which he defends himself against the charge of practising these arts, affirming that he is wholly a stranger to them, and only wishing to show his innocence by denying such things as cannot be innocently committed. But all the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the magicians, who he thinks are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> deserving of condemnation, are performed according to the teaching and by the power of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Why, then, does he think that they ought to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>? For he asserts that they are necessary, in order to present our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to the gods, and yet their works are such as we must shun if we wish our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to reach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Again, I ask, what kind of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of men does he suppose are presented to the good gods by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>? If magical <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, they will have none such; if lawful <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, they will not receive them through such beings. But if a sinner who is penitent pour out <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, especially if he has committed any crime of sorcery, does he receive pardon through the intercession of those <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by whose instigation and help he has fallen into the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> he mourns? Or do the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> themselves, in order that they may merit pardon for the penitent, first become penitents because they have deceived them? This no one ever said concerning the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; for had this been the case, they would never have dared to seek for themselves divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>. For how should they do so who desired by penitence to obtain the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of pardon; seeing that such detestable <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> could not exist along with a humility worthy of pardon?</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; Whether We are to Believe that the Good Gods are More Willing to Have Intercourse with Demons Than with Men.</h2>

<p>But does any urgent and most pressing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> compel the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> to mediate between the gods and men, that they may offer the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and bring back the answers from the gods? And if so, what, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, is that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, what is that so great necessity? Because, say they, no god has intercourse with man. Most admirable <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which has no intercourse with a supplicating man, and yet has intercourse with an arrogant <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>! Which has no intercourse with a penitent man, and yet has intercourse with a deceiving <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>! Which has no intercourse with a man fleeing for refuge to the divine nature, and yet has intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> feigning divinity! Which has no intercourse with a man seeking pardon, and yet has intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> persuading to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>! Which has no intercourse with a man expelling the poets by means of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> writings from a well-regulated state, and yet has intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> requesting from the princes and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of a state the theatrical  performance of the mockeries of the poets! Which has no intercourse with the man who prohibits the ascribing of crime to the gods, and yet has intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> who takes delight in the fictitious representation of their crimes! Which has no intercourse with a man punishing the crimes of the magicians by just <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and yet has intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> teaching and practising magical arts! Which has no intercourse with a man shunning the imitation of a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, and yet has intercourse with a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> lying in wait for the deception of a man!</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.&mdash; Whether the Gods Use the Demons as Messengers and Interpreters, and Whether They are Deceived by Them Willingly, or Without Their Own Knowledge.</h2>

<p>But herein, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, lies the great necessity for this absurdity, so unworthy of the gods, that the ethereal gods, who are concerned about <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, would not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what terrestrial men were doing unless the aerial <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> should bring them intelligence, because the ether is suspended far away from the earth and far above it, but the air is contiguous both to the ether and to the earth. O admirable wisdom! What else do these men think concerning the gods who, they say, are all in the highest degree good, but that they are concerned about <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, lest they should seem unworthy of worship, while, on the other hand, from the distance between the elements, they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of terrestrial things? It is on this account that they have supposed the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> to be necessary as agents, through whom the gods may inform themselves with respect to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, and through whom, when necessary, they may succor men; and it is on account of this office that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> themselves have been held as deserving of worship. If this be the case, then a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> is better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by these good gods through nearness of body, than a man is by goodness of mind. O mournful necessity, or shall I not rather say detestable and vain <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, that I may not impute vanity to the divine nature! For if the gods can, with their minds free from the hindrance of bodies, see our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, they do not need the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> as messengers from our mind to them; but if the ethereal gods, by means of their bodies, perceive the corporeal indices of minds, as the countenance, speech, motion, and thence understand what the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> tell them, then it is also possible that they may be deceived by the falsehoods of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Moreover, if the divinity of the gods cannot be deceived by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, neither can it be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of our actions. But I would they would tell me whether the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have informed the gods that the fictions of the poets concerning the crimes of the gods displease <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, concealing the pleasure which they themselves take in them; or whether they have concealed both, and have preferred that the gods should be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> with respect to this whole matter, or have told both, as well the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> with respect to the gods as their own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, which is injurious to the gods; or whether they have concealed <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> opinion, according to which he was unwilling that the gods should be defamed with <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> alleged crimes through the impious license of the poets, while they have not been ashamed nor afraid to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, which make them <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> theatrical plays, in which the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the gods are celebrated. Let them choose which they will of these four alternatives, and let them consider how much <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> any one of them would require them to think of the gods. For if they choose the first, they must then confess that it was not possible for the good gods to dwell with the good <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, though he sought to prohibit things injurious to them, while they dwelt with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who exulted in their injuries; and this because they suppose that the good gods can only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, placed at so great a distance from them, through the mediation of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, whom they could <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> on account of their nearness to themselves.  If they shall choose the second, and shall say that both these things are concealed by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, so that the gods are wholly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> both of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> most religious law and the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> pleasure of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, what, in that case, can the gods <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to any profit with respect to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs through these mediating <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, when they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> those things which are decreed, through the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of good men, for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the good gods against the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>? But if they shall choose the third, and reply that these intermediary <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have communicated, not only the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, which prohibited wrongs to be done to the gods, but also their own delight in these wrongs, I would ask if such a communication is not rather an insult? Now the gods, hearing both and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> both, not only permit the approach of those malign <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who desire and do things contrary to the dignity of the gods and the religion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, but also, through these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who are near to them, send <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to the good <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who is far  away from them; for they inhabit such a place in the concatenated series of the elements, that they can come into contact with those by whom they are accused, but not with him by whom they are defended&mdash;<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> on both sides, but not being able to change the weight of the air and the earth. There remains the fourth supposition; but it is worse than the rest. For who will suffer it to be said that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> fictions of the poets concerning the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> gods, and also the disgraceful mockeries of the theatres, and their own most ardent <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after, and most sweet pleasure in these things, while they have concealed from them that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, with the gravity of a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, gave it as his opinion that all these things ought to be removed from a well-regulated republic; so that the good gods are now compelled, through such messengers, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doings of the most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> beings, that is to say, of the messengers themselves, and are not allowed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, though the former are for the injury, but these latter for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the gods themselves?</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; That We Must, Notwithstanding the Opinion of Apuleius, Reject the Worship of Demons.</h2>

<p>None of these four alternatives, then, is to be chosen; for we dare not suppose such unbecoming things concerning the gods as the adoption of any one of them would lead us to think. It remains, therefore, that no credence whatever is to be given to the opinion of Apuleius and the other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the same school, namely, that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> act as messengers and interpreters between the gods and men to carry our petitions from us to the gods, and to bring back to us the help of the gods. On the contrary, we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them to be spirits most eager to inflict harm, utterly alien from righteousness, swollen with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, pale with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, subtle in deceit; who dwell indeed in this air as in a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, in keeping with their own character, because, cast down from the height of the higher heaven, they have been condemned to dwell in this element as the just reward of irretrievable transgression. But, though the air is situated above the earth and the waters, they are not on that account superior in merit to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who, though they do not surpass them as far as their earthly bodies are concerned, do nevertheless far excel them through <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>&mdash;they having made choice of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God as their helper. Over many, however, who are manifestly unworthy of participation in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, they tyrannize as over captives whom they have subdued&mdash;the greatest part of whom they have persuaded of their divinity by wonderful and lying signs, consisting either of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> or of predictions. Some, nevertheless, who have more attentively and diligently considered their <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, they have not been able to persuade that they are gods, and so have feigned themselves to be messengers between the gods and men. Some, indeed, have thought that not even this latter <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> ought to be acknowledged as belonging to them, not believing that they were gods, because they saw that they were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, whereas the gods, according to their view, are all good. Nevertheless they dared not say that they were wholly unworthy of all divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of offending the multitude, by whom, through inveterate <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> were served by the performance of many <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, and the erection of many temples.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.&mdash; What Hermes Trismegistus Thought Concerning Idolatry, and from What Source He Knew that the Superstitions of Egypt Were to Be Abolished.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Hermes, whom they call Trismegistus, had a different opinion concerning those <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Apuleius, indeed, denies that they are gods; but when he says that they hold a middle place between the gods and men, so that they seem to be necessary for men as mediators between them and the gods, he does not distinguish between the worship due to them and the religious homage due to the supernal gods. This <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, however, says that there are some gods made by the supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and some made by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Any one who hears this, as I have stated it, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> supposes that it has reference to images, because they are the works of the hands of men; but he asserts that visible and tangible images are, as it were, only the bodies of the gods, and that there dwell in them certain spirits, which have been invited to come into them, and which have power to inflict harm, or to fulfil the desires of those by whom divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> and services are rendered to them. To unite, therefore, by a certain art, those invisible spirits to visible and material things, so as to make, as it were, animated bodies, dedicated and given up to those spirits who inhabit them&mdash;this, he says, is to make gods, adding that men have received this great and wonderful power. I will give the words of this <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> as they have been translated into our tongue: <q>And, since we have undertaken to discourse concerning the relationship and fellowship between men and the gods,  <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O &AElig;sculapius, the power and strength of man. As the Lord and Father, or that which is highest, even <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is the maker of the celestial gods, so man is the maker of the gods who are in the temples, content to dwell near to men.</q>  And a little after he says, <q>Thus humanity, always mindful of its nature and origin, perseveres in the imitation of divinity; and as the Lord and Father made <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> gods, that they should be like Himself, so humanity fashioned its own gods according to the likeness of its own countenance.</q> When this &AElig;sculapius, to whom especially he was speaking, had answered him, and had said, <q>Do you mean the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, O Trismegistus?</q>&mdash; <q>Yes, the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>,</q> replied he, <q>however unbelieving you are, O &AElig;sculapius&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, animated and full of sensation and spirit, and who do such great and wonderful things&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> prescient of future things, and foretelling them by lot, by <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, by dreams, and many other things, who bring diseases on men and cure them again, giving them <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> or sorrow according to their merits. Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O &AElig;sculapius, that <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> is an image of heaven, or, more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, a translation and descent of all things which are ordered and transacted there, that it is, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, if we may say so, to be the temple of the whole world? And yet, as it becomes the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> man to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things beforehand, you ought not to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this, that there is a time coming when it shall appear that the Egyptians have all in vain, with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and with most scrupulous diligence, waited on the divinity, and when all their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> worship shall come to nought, and be found to be in vain.</q></p>

<p>Hermes then follows out at great length the statements of this passage, in which he seems to predict the present time, in which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> is overthrowing all lying figments with a vehemence and liberty proportioned to its superior <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, in order that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Saviour may deliver men from those gods which man has made, and subject them to that God by whom man was made. But when Hermes predicts these things, he speaks as one who is a friend to these same mockeries of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and does not clearly express the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. On the contrary, he deplores, as if it had already taken place, the future abolition of those things by the observance of which there was maintained in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> a resemblance of heaven,&mdash; he bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by a kind of mournful <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. Now it was with reference to such that the apostle said, that <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened; professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of corruptible man,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120321"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;1:21</a></span> and so on, for the whole passage is too long to quote. For Hermes makes many such statements agreeable to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> concerning the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God who fashioned this world. And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how he has become so bewildered by that <q>darkening of the heart</q> as to stumble into the expression of a desire that men should always continue in subjection to those gods which he confesses to be made by men, and to bewail their future removal; as if there could be anything more wretched than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> tyrannized over by the work of his own hands, since man, by worshipping the works of his own hands, may more easily cease to be man, than the works of his hands can, through his worship of them, become gods. For it can sooner happen that man, who has received an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> position, may, through lack of understanding, become comparable to the beasts, than that the works of man may become preferable to the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, made in His own image, that is, to man himself. Wherefore deservedly is man left to fall away from Him who made Him, when he prefers to himself that which he himself has made.</p>

<p>For these vain, deceitful, pernicious, <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> things did the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Hermes sorrow, because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the time was coming when they should be removed. But his sorrow was as impudently expressed as his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was imprudently obtained; for it was not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> who revealed these things to him, as He had done to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who, foreseeing these things, said with exultation, <q>If a man shall make gods, lo, they are no gods;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120322"><a href="../bible/jer016.htm#verse10">Jeremiah&nbsp;16:10</a></span> and in another place, <q>And it shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord, that I will cut off the names of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120323"><a href="../bible/zec013.htm#verse2">Zechariah&nbsp;13:2</a></span> But the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Isaiah prophesies expressly concerning <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> in reference to this matter, saying, <q>And the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> shall be moved at His presence, and their heart shall be overcome in them,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120324"><a href="../bible/isa019.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;19:1</a></span> and other things to the same effect. And with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> are to be classed those who rejoiced that that which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> was to come had actually come&mdash;as Simeon, or Anna, who immediately recognized Jesus when He  was born, or <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a>, who in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> recognized Him when He was conceived, or Peter, who said by the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>You are Christ, the Son of the living God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120325"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;16:16</a></span> But to this <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> those spirits indicated the time of their own destruction, who also, when the Lord was present in the flesh, said with trembling, <q>Have You come hither to destroy us before the time?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120326"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;8:29</a></span> meaning by destruction before the time, either that very destruction which they expected to come, but which they did not think would come so suddenly as it appeared to have done, or only that destruction which consisted in their being brought into contempt by being made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. And, indeed, this was a destruction before the time, that is, before the time of judgment, when they are to be punished with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> damnation, together with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who are implicated in their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion declares, which neither <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> nor leads into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; for it is not like him who, blown here and there by every wind of doctrine, and mixing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> things with things which are false, bewails as about to perish a religion, which he afterwards confesses to be <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.&mdash; How Hermes Openly Confessed the Error of His Forefathers, the Coming Destruction of Which He Nevertheless Bewailed.</h2>

<p>After a long interval, Hermes again comes back to the subject of the gods which men have made, saying as follows: <q>But enough on this subject. Let us return to man and to reason, that divine gift on account of which man has been called a rational animal. For the things which have been said concerning man, wonderful though they are, are less wonderful than those which have been said concerning reason. For man to discover the divine nature, and to make it, surpasses the wonder of all other wonderful things. Because, therefore, our forefathers erred very far with respect to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the gods, through incredulity and through want of attention to their worship and service, they invented this art of making gods; and this art once invented, they associated with it a suitable <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> borrowed from universal nature, and being incapable of making <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, they evoked those of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> or of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and united them with these <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> images and divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, in order that through these <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> the images might have power to do good or harm to men.</q> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> themselves could have been made, even by <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjuration</a>, to confess as he has confessed in these words: <q>Because our forefathers erred very far with respect to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the gods, through incredulity and through want of attention to their worship and service, they invented the art of making gods.</q> Does he say that it was a moderate degree of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which resulted in their discovery of the art of making gods, or was he content to say <q>they erred?</q> No; he must needs add <q>very far,</q> and say, <q> <em>They erred very far</em>.</q> It was this great <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and incredulity, then, of their forefathers who did not attend to the worship and service of the gods, which was the origin of the art of making gods. And yet this wise man grieves over the ruin of this art at some future time, as if it were a divine religion. Is he not verily compelled by divine influence, on the one hand, to reveal the past <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of his forefathers, and by a diabolical influence, on the other hand, to bewail the future punishment of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>? For if their forefathers, by erring very far with respect to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the gods, through incredulity and aversion of mind from their worship and service, invented the art of making gods, what wonder is it that all that is done by this detestable art, which is opposed to the divine religion, should be taken away by that religion, when <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> corrects <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> refutes incredulity, and conversion rectifies aversion?</p>

<p>For if he had only said, without mentioning the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, that his forefathers had discovered the art of making gods, it would have been our duty, if we paid any regard to what is right and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, to consider and to see that they could never have attained to this art if they had not erred from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, if they had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> those things which are worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if they had attended to divine worship and service. However, if we alone should say that the causes of this art were to be found in the great <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and incredulity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and aversion of the mind erring from and unfaithful to divine religion, the impudence of those who resist the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> were in some way to be borne with; but when he who admires in man, above all other things, this power which it has been granted him to practise, and sorrows because a time is coming when all those figments of gods invented by men shall even be commanded by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to be taken away&mdash;when even this man confesses nevertheless, and explains the causes which led to the discovery of this art, saying that their ancestors, through great <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and incredulity, and through not attending to the worship and service of the gods, invented this art of making gods&mdash;what ought we to say, or rather to do, but to give to the Lord our God all the thanks we are able, because He has taken  away those things by causes the contrary of those which led to their institution? For that which the prevalence of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> instituted, the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> took away; that which incredulity instituted, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> took away; that which aversion from divine worship and service instituted, conversion to the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> God took away. Nor was this the case only in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, for which country alone the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> lamented in Hermes, but in all the earth, which sings to the Lord a new song,  as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> prophetic Scriptures have predicted, in which it is written, <q>Sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth.</q> For the title of this psalm is, <q>When the house was built after the captivity.</q> For a house is being built to the Lord in all the earth, even the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, after that captivity in which <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> held captive those men who, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, became living stones in the house. For although man made gods, it did not follow that he who made them was not held captive by them, when, by worshipping them, he was drawn into fellowship with them&mdash;into the fellowship not of stolid <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, but of cunning <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; for what are <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> but what they are represented to be in the same scriptures, <q>They have eyes, but they do not see,</q>  and, though artistically fashioned, are still without life and sensation? But unclean spirits, associated through that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> art with these same <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, have miserably taken captive the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of their worshippers, by bringing them down into fellowship with themselves. Whence the apostle says, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that an idol is nothing, but those things which the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and I would not ye should have fellowship with <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120329"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:19-20</a></span> After this captivity, therefore, in which men were held by malign <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, the house of God is being built in all the earth; whence the title of that psalm in which it is said, <q>Sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth. Sing unto the Lord, bless His name; declare well His <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from day to day. Declare His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, among all people His wonderful things. For great is the Lord, and much to be praised: He is terrible above all gods. For all the gods of the nations are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>: but the Lord made the heavens.</q> </p>

<p>Wherefore he who sorrowed because a time was coming when the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> should be abolished, and the domination of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> over those who worshipped them, wished, under the influence of a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, that that captivity should always continue, at the cessation of which that psalm celebrates the building of the house of the Lord in all the earth. Hermes foretold these things with grief, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> with joyfulness; and because the Spirit is victorious who sang these things through the ancient <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, even Hermes himself was compelled in a wonderful manner to confess, that those very things which he wished not to be removed, and at the prospect of whose removal he was sorrowful, had been instituted, not by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, faithful, and religious, but by erring and unbelieving men, averse to the worship and service of the gods. And although he calls them gods, nevertheless, when he says that they were made by such men as we certainly ought not to be, he shows, whether he will or not, that they are not to be worshipped by those who do not resemble these image-makers, that is, by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, faithful, and religious men, at the same time also making it manifest that the very men who made them involved themselves in the worship of those as gods who were not gods. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is the saying of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>If a man <em>make</em> gods, lo, they are no gods.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120331"><a href="../bible/jer016.htm#verse20">Jeremiah&nbsp;16:20</a></span> Such gods, therefore, acknowledged by such worshippers and made by such men, did Hermes call <q>gods made by men,</q> that is to say, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, through some art of I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what description, bound by the chains of their own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> to images. But, nevertheless, he did not agree with that opinion of the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> Apuleius, of which we have already shown the incongruity and absurdity, namely, that they were interpreters and intercessors between the gods whom God made, and men whom the same God made, bringing to God the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and from God the gifts given in answer to these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. For it is exceedingly stupid to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that gods whom men have made have more influence with gods whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has made than men themselves have, whom the very same God has made. And consider, too, that it is a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> which, bound by a man to an image by means of an impious art, has been made a god, but a god to such a man only, not to every man. What kind of god, therefore, is that which no man would make but one erring, incredulous, and averse to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God? Moreover, if the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> which are worshipped in the temples, being introduced by some kind of strange art into images, that is, into visible representations of themselves, by those men who by this art made gods when they were straying away from, and were averse to the worship and service of the gods&mdash;if, I say, those <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>  are neither mediators nor interpreters between men and the gods, both on account of their own most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and base manners, and because men, though erring, incredulous, and averse from the worship and service of the gods, are nevertheless beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> better than the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> whom they themselves have evoked, then it remains to be affirmed that what power they possess they possess as <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, doing harm by bestowing pretended benefits&mdash;harm all the greater for the deception&mdash;or else openly and undisguisedly doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to men. They cannot, however, do anything of this kind unless where they are permitted by the deep and secret <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and then only so far as they are permitted. When, however, they are permitted, it is not because they, being midway between men and the gods, have through the friendship of the gods great power over men; for these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> cannot possibly be friends to the good gods who dwell in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and heavenly habitation, by whom we mean <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and rational creatures, whether thrones, or dominations, or principalities, or powers, from whom they are as far separated in disposition and character as <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is distant from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> from goodness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25.&mdash; Concerning Those Things Which May Be Common to the Holy Angels and to Men.</h2>

<p>Wherefore we must by no means seek, through the supposed mediation of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, to avail ourselves of the benevolence or beneficence of the gods, or rather of the good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but through resembling them in the possession of a good will, through which we are with them, and live with them, and worship with them the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although we cannot see them with the eyes of our flesh. But it is not in locality we are distant from them, but in merit of life, caused by our miserable unlikeness to them in will, and by the weakness of our character; for the mere fact of our dwelling on earth under the conditions of life in the flesh does not prevent our fellowship with them. It is only prevented when we, in the impurity of our hearts, mind earthly things. But in this present time, while we are being healed that we may eventually be as they are, we are brought near to them by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if by their assistance we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He who is their blessedness is also ours.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.&mdash; That All the Religion of the Pagans Has Reference to Dead Men.</h2>

<p>It is certainly a remarkable thing how this <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, when expressing his grief that a time was coming when those things would be taken away from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, which he confesses to have been invented by men erring, incredulous, and averse to the service of divine religion, says, among other things, <q>Then shall that land, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place of shrines and temples, be full of sepulchres and dead men,</q> as if, in truth, if these things were not taken away, men would not die! As if dead bodies could be buried elsewhere than in the ground! As if, as time advanced, the number of sepulchres must not necessarily increase in proportion to the increase of the number of the dead! But they who are of a perverse <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and opposed to us, suppose that what he grieves for is that the memorials of our <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were to succeed to their temples and shrines, in order, forsooth, that they may have grounds for thinking that gods were worshipped by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> in temples, but that dead men are worshipped by us in sepulchres. For with such blindness do impious men, as it were, stumble over mountains, and will not see the things which strike their own eyes, that they do not attend to the fact that in all the literature of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> there are not found any, or scarcely any gods, who have not been men, to whom, when dead, divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> have been paid. I will not enlarge on the fact that Varro says that all dead men are thought by them to be gods&mdash; Manes and proves it by those sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> which are performed in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of almost all the dead, among which he mentions funeral games, considering this the very highest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of divinity, because games are only wont to be celebrated in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of divinities. Hermes himself, of whom we are now treating, in that same book in which, as if foretelling future things, he says with sorrow <q>Then shall that land, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place of shrines and temples, be full of sepulchres and dead men,</q> testifies that the gods of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> were dead men. For, having said that their forefathers, erring very far with respect to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the gods, incredulous and inattentive to the divine worship and service, invented the art of making gods, with which art, when invented, they associated the appropriate <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is inherent in universal nature, and by mixing up that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with this art, they called forth the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> or of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (for they could not make <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>), and caused them to take possession of, or associate themselves with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> images and divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, in order that through these <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> the images might have power to do good or harm to men;&mdash; having said this, he goes on, as it were, to prove it by illustrations, saying, <q>Your grandsire, O &AElig;sculapius, the first discoverer of medicine, to whom a temple was  <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in a mountain of Libya, near to the shore of the crocodiles, in which temple lies his earthly man, that is, his body&mdash;for the better part of him, or rather the whole of him, if the whole man is in the intelligent life, went back to heaven,&mdash; affords even now by his divinity all those helps to infirm men which formerly he was wont to afford to them by the art of medicine.</q> He says, therefore that a dead man was worshipped as a god in that place where he had his sepulchre. He deceives men by a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, for the man <q>went back to heaven.</q> Then he adds <q>Does not Hermes, who was my grandsire, and whose name I bear, abiding in the country which is called by his name, help and preserve all mortals who come to him from every quarter?</q> For this elder Hermes, that is, Mercury, who, he says, was his grandsire, is said to be buried in Hermopolis, that is, in the city called by his name; so here are two gods whom he affirms to have been men, &AElig;sculapius and Mercury. Now concerning &AElig;sculapius, both the Greeks and the Latins think the same thing; but as to Mercury, there are many who do not think that he was formerly a mortal, though Hermes testifies that he was his grandsire. But are these two different individuals who were called by the same name? I will not dispute much whether they are different individuals or not. It is sufficient to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this Mercury of whom Hermes speaks is, as well as &AElig;sculapius, a god who once was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, according, to the testimony of this same Trismegistus, esteemed so great by his countrymen, and also the grandson of Mercury himself.</p>

<p>Hermes goes on to say, <q>But do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things Isis, the wife of Osiris, bestows when she is propitious, and what great opposition she can offer when enraged?</q> Then, in order to show that there were gods made by men through this art, he goes on to say, <q>For it is easy for earthly and mundane gods to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, being made and composed by men out of either nature;</q> thus giving us to understand that he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> were formerly the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of dead men, which, as he says, by means of a certain art invented by men very far in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, incredulous, and irreligious, were caused to take possession of images, because they who made such gods were not able to make <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. When, therefore, he says <q>either nature,</q> he means <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> being the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the image the body. What, then, becomes of that mournful complaint, that the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place of shrines and temples, was to be full of sepulchres and dead men? Verily, the fallacious spirit, by whose inspiration Hermes spoke these things, was compelled to confess through him that even already that land was full of sepulchres and of dead men, whom they were worshipping as gods. But it was the grief of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> which was expressing itself through his mouth, who were sorrowing on account of the punishments which were about to fall upon them at the tombs of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. For in many such places they are tortured and compelled to confess, and are cast out of the bodies of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, of which they had taken possession.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27.&mdash; Concerning the Nature of the Honor Which the Christians Pay to Their Martyrs.</h2>

<p>But, nevertheless, we do not build temples, and ordain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for these same <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; for they are not our gods, but their God is our God. Certainly we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> their reliquaries, as the memorials of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men of God who strove for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> even to the death of their bodies, that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion might be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and false and fictitious <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a> exposed. For if there were some before them who thought that these <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a> were really false and fictitious, they were afraid to give expression to their convictions. But who ever heard a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the faithful, standing at an altar built for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and worship of God over the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> body of some <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, say in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, I offer to you a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, O Peter, or O <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, or O Cyprian? For it is to God that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are offered at their tombs&mdash;the God who made them both men and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and associated them with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in celestial <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; and the reason why we pay such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> to their memory is, that by so doing we may both give thanks to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God for their victories, and, by recalling them afresh to remembrance, may stir ourselves up to imitate them by seeking to obtain like crowns and palms, calling to our help that same God on whom they called. Therefore, whatever <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> the religious may pay in the places of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, they are but <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> rendered to their memory,  not sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> or <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> offered to dead men as to gods. And even such as bring there food&mdash;which, indeed, is not done by the better <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and in most places of the world is not done at all&mdash;do so in order that it may be sanctified to them through the merits of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, in the name of the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, first presenting the food and offering <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and thereafter taking it away to be eaten, or to be in part bestowed upon  the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">needy</a>.  But he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the one <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> offered in those places, also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that these are not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> offered to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. It is, then, neither with divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> nor with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> crimes, by which they worship their gods, that we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> our <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; neither do we offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to them, or convert the crimes of the gods into their sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. For let those who will and can read the letter of Alexander to his mother Olympias, in which he tells the things which were revealed to him by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Leon, and let those who have read it recall to memory what it contains, that they may see what great abominations have been handed down to memory, not by poets, but by the mystic writings of the Egyptians, concerning the goddess Isis, the wife of Osiris, and the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of both, all of whom, according to these writings, were royal personages. Isis, when <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> to her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, is said to have discovered a crop of barley, of which she brought some ears to the king her husband, and his councillor Mercurius, and hence they identify her with Ceres. Those who read the letter may there see what was the character of those people to whom when dead sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> were instituted as to gods, and what those <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of theirs were which furnished the occasion for these <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. Let them not once dare to compare in any respect those people, though they hold them to be gods, to our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, though we do not hold them to be gods. For we do not ordain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to our <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, as they do to their dead men, for that would be incongruous, undue, and unlawful, such being due only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and thus we do not delight them with their own crimes, or with such shameful plays as those in which the crimes of the gods are celebrated, which are either real crimes committed by them at a time when they were men, or else, if they never were men, fictitious crimes invented for the pleasure of noxious <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. The god of Socrates, if he had a god, cannot have belonged to this class of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. But perhaps they who wished to excel in this art of making gods, imposed a god of this sort on a man who was a stranger to, and innocent of any connection with that art. What need we say more? No one who is even moderately wise imagines that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are to be worshipped on account of the blessed life which is to be after death. But perhaps they will say that all the gods are good, but that of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> some are bad and some good, and that it is the good who are to be worshipped, in order that through them we may attain to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> blessed life. To the examination of this opinion we will devote the following book.</p>
