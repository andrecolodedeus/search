<h1>The City of God (Book X)</h1>

<p class="h1a">In this book Augustine teaches that the good angels wish God alone, whom they themselves serve, to receive that divine honor which is rendered by sacrifice, and which is called <q>latreia.</q> He then goes on to dispute against Porphyry about the principle and way of the soul's cleansing and deliverance.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; That the Platonists Themselves Have Determined that God Alone Can Confer Happiness Either on Angels or Men, But that It Yet Remains a Question Whether Those Spirits Whom They Direct Us to Worship, that We May Obtain Happiness, Wish Sacrifice to Be Offered to Themselves, or to the One God Only.</h2>

<p>It is the decided opinion of all who use their brains, that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> desire to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. But who are <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, or how they become so, these are questions about which the weakness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> understanding stirs endless and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> controversies, in which <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have wasted their strength and expended their leisure. To adduce and discuss their various opinions would be tedious, and is unnecessary. The reader may remember what we said in the eighth book, while making a selection of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> with whom we might discuss the question regarding the future life of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, whether we can reach it by paying divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> to the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator of all gods, or by worshipping many gods, and he will not expect us to repeat here the same argument, especially as, even if he has forgotten it, he may refresh his memory by reperusal. For we made selection of the Platonists, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> esteemed the noblest of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, because they had the wit to perceive that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and rational, or intellectual, as it is, cannot be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> except by partaking of the light of that God by whom both itself and the world were made; and also that the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life which all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> desire cannot be reached by any who does not cleave with a pure and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to that one supreme good, the unchangeable God. But as even these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, whether accommodating to the folly and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the people, or, as the apostle says, <q>becoming vain in their imaginations,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120369"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;1:21</a></span> supposed or allowed others to suppose that many gods should be worshipped, so that some of them considered that divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> by worship and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> should be rendered even to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> (an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> I have already exploded), we must now, by God's help, ascertain what is thought about our religious worship and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> by those <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and blessed spirits, who dwell in the heavenly places among dominations, principalities, powers, whom the Platonists call gods, and some either good <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, or, like us, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>&mdash;that is to say, to put it more plainly, whether the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> desire us to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and worship, and to consecrate our possessions and ourselves, to them or only to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, theirs and ours.</p>

<p>For this is the worship which is due to the Divinity, or, to speak more accurately, to the Deity; and, to express this worship in a single word as there does not occur to me any Latin term sufficiently exact, I shall avail myself, whenever necessary, of a Greek word. <span class="greek">&#x039B;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, whenever it occurs in Scripture, is rendered by the word service. But that service which is due to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and in reference to which the apostle writes that servants must be subject to their own masters, <span class="stiki" id="note120370"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;6:5</a></span> is usually designated by another word in Greek,  whereas the service which is paid to God alone by worship, is always, or almost always, called <span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span> in the usage of those who wrote from the divine oracles. This cannot so well be called simply <q>cultus,</q> for in that case it would not seem to be due exclusively to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for the same word is applied to the respect  we pay either to the memory or the living presence of men. From it, too, we derive the words agriculture, colonist, and others.  And the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> call their gods <q>c&oelig;licol&aelig;,</q> not because they worship heaven, but because they dwell in it, and as it were colonize it&mdash;not in the sense in which we call those colonists who are attached to their native soil to cultivate it under the rule of the owners, but in the sense in which the great master of the Latin language says, <q>There was an ancient city inhabited by Tyrian colonists.</q>  He called them colonists, not because they cultivated the soil, but because they inhabited the city. So, too, cities that have hived off from larger cities are called colonies. Consequently, while it is quite <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, using the word in a special sense, <q>cult</q> can be rendered to none but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet, as the word is applied to other things besides, the cult due to God cannot in Latin be expressed by this word alone.</p>

<p>The word <q>religion</q> might seem to express more definitely the worship due to God alone, and therefore Latin translators have used this word to represent <span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03C1;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>; yet, as not only the uneducated, but also the best instructed, use the word religion to express <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> ties, and relationships, and affinities, it would inevitably introduce ambiguity to use this word in discussing the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unable as we are to say that religion is nothing else than the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without contradicting the common usage which applies this word to the observance of social relationships. <q>Piety,</q> again, or, as the Greeks say, <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x1F73;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span>, is commonly understood as the proper designation of the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet this word also is used of dutifulness to <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. The common people, too, use it of works of charity, which, I suppose, arises from the circumstance that God enjoins the performance of such works, and declares that He is pleased with them instead of, or in preference to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. From this usage it has also come to pass that God Himself is called <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>,  in which sense the Greeks never use <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03BD;</span>, though <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x1F73;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span> is applied to works of charity by their common people also. In some passages of Scripture, therefore, they have sought to preserve the distinction by using not <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x1F73;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span>, the more general word, but <span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x1F73;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span>, which literally denotes the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We, on the other hand, cannot express either of these ideas by one word. This worship, then, which in Greek is called <span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, and in Latin <q>servitus</q> [service], but the service due to God only; this worship, which in Greek is called <span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03C1;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, and in Latin <q>religio,</q> but the religion by which we are bound to God only; this worship, which they call <span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x1F73;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span>, but which we cannot express in one word, but call it the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;this, we say, belongs only to that God who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who makes His worshippers gods.  And therefore, whoever these <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and blessed inhabitants of heaven be, if they do not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> us, and wish us to be blessed, then we ought not to worship them; and if they do <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> us and desire our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, they cannot wish us to be made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> by any other means than they themselves have enjoyed&mdash;for how could they wish our blessedness to flow from one source, theirs from another?</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; The Opinion of Plotinus the Platonist Regarding Enlightenment from Above.</h2>

<p>But with these more estimable <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> we have no dispute in this matter. For they perceived, and in various forms abundantly expressed in their writings, that these spirits have the same source of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> as ourselves&mdash;a certain intelligible light, which is their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is different from themselves, and illumines them that they may be penetrated with light, and enjoy perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in the participation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Plotinus, commenting on <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, repeatedly and strongly asserts that not even the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the world, derives its blessedness from any other source than we do, viz., from that Light which is distinct from it and created it, and by whose intelligible illumination it enjoys light in things intelligible. He also compares those spiritual things to the vast and conspicuous heavenly bodies, as if God were the sun, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the moon; for they suppose that the moon derives its light from the sun. That great <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a>, therefore, says that the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or rather the intellectual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash;in which class he comprehends the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the blessed immortals who inhabit heaven,&mdash; has no nature superior to it save <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator of the world and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, and that these heavenly spirits derive their blessed life, and the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from their blessed life, and the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the source as ourselves, agreeing with the gospel where we read, <q>There was a man sent from God whose name was John; the same came for a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of that Light, that through Him all might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. He was not that Light, but that he might bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the Light. That was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light which lights every man that  comes into the world;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120376"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;1:6-9</a></span> a distinction which sufficiently proves that the rational or intellectual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> such as John had cannot be its own light, but needs to receive illumination from another, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light. This John himself avows when he delivers his <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>: <q>We have all received of His fullness.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; That the Platonists, Though Knowing Something of the Creator of the Universe, Have Misunderstood the True Worship of God, by Giving Divine Honor to Angels, Good or Bad.</h2>

<p>This being so, if the Platonists, or those who think with them, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him as God and gave thanks, if they did not become vain in their own thoughts, if they did not originate or yield to the popular <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, they would certainly acknowledge that neither could the blessed immortals retain, nor we miserable mortals reach, a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> condition without worshipping the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> of gods, who is both theirs and ours. To Him we owe the service which is called in Greek <span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, whether we render it outwardly or inwardly; for we are all His temple, each of us severally and all of us together, because He condescends to inhabit each individually and the whole harmonious body, being no greater in all than in each, since He is neither expanded nor divided. Our heart when it rises to Him is His altar; the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who intercedes for us is His Only-begotten; we <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to Him bleeding victims when we contend for His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> even unto blood; to Him we offer the sweetest <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> when we come before Him burning with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; to Him we devote and surrender ourselves and His gifts in us; to Him, by solemn feasts and on appointed days, we consecrate the memory of His benefits, lest through the lapse of time ungrateful oblivion should steal upon us; to Him we offer on the altar of our heart the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of humility and praise, kindled by the fire of burning <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. It is that we may see Him, so far as He can be seen; it is that we may cleave to Him, that we are cleansed from all stain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in His name. For He is the fountain of our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, He the end of all our desires. Being attached to Him, or rather let me say, re-attached,&mdash; for we had detached ourselves and lost hold of Him&mdash;being, I say, re-attached to Him,  we tend towards Him by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that we may rest in Him, and find our blessedness by attaining that end. For our good, about which <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have so keenly contended, is nothing else than to be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is, if I may say so, by spiritually embracing Him that the intellectual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is filled and impregnated with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. We are enjoined to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> this good with all our heart, with all our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, with all our strength. To this good we ought to be led by those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> us, and to lead those we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Thus are fulfilled those two commandments on which hang all the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>;</q> and <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbor as yourself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120379"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;22:37-40</a></span> For, that man might be intelligent in his self-<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, there was appointed for him an end to which he might refer all his actions, that he might be blessed. For he who loves himself wishes nothing else than this. And the end set before him is <q>to draw near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  And so, when one who has this intelligent self-<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is commanded to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> his neighbor as himself, what else is enjoined than that he shall do all in his power to commend to him the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God? This is the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, this right <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, this the service due to God only. If any <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> power, then, no matter with what <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> endowed, loves us as himself, he must desire that we find our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> by submitting ourselves to Him, in submission to whom he himself finds <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. If he does not worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he is wretched, because deprived of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; if he worships <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he cannot wish to be worshipped in God's stead. On the contrary, these higher powers acquiesce heartily in the divine sentence in which it is written, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120381"><a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;22:20</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; That Sacrifice is Due to the True God Only.</h2>

<p>But, putting aside for the present the other religious services with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is worshipped, certainly no man would dare to say that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is due to any but God. Many parts, indeed, of divine worship are unduly used in showing <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whether through an excessive humility or pernicious flattery; yet, while this is done, those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are thus worshipped and venerated, or even adored, are reckoned no more than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>; and who ever thought of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> save to one whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, supposed, or feigned to be a god? And how ancient a part of God's worship <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is, those two  brothers, Cain and Abel, sufficiently show, of whom God rejected the elder's <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and looked favorably on the younger's.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; Of the Sacrifices Which God Does Not Require, But Wished to Be Observed for the Exhibition of Those Things Which He Does Require.</h2>

<p>And who is so foolish as to suppose that the things offered to God are needed by Him for some uses of His own? Divine Scripture in many places explodes this idea. Not to be wearisome, suffice it to quote this brief saying from a psalm: &nbsp;<q>I have said to the Lord, You are my God: for You need not my goodness.</q>  We must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, then, that God has no need, not only of cattle, or any other earthly and material thing, but even of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> righteousness, and that whatever right worship is paid to God profits not Him, but man. For no man would say he did a benefit to a fountain by drinking, or to the light by seeing. And the fact that the ancient church offered animal <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, which the people of God now-a-days read of without imitating, proves nothing else than this, that those <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> signified the things which we do for the purpose of drawing near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and inducing our neighbor to do the same. A <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, therefore, is the visible sacrament or sacred sign of an invisible <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. Hence that penitent in the psalm, or it may be the Psalmist himself, entreating God to be merciful to his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, says, <q>If You desired <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, I would give it: You delight not in whole burnt-offerings. The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of God is a broken heart: a heart contrite and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> God will not despise.</q>  Observe how, in the very words in which he is expressing God's refusal of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, he shows that God requires <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. He does not desire the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of a slaughtered beast, but He desires the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of a contrite heart. Thus, that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> which he says God does not wish, is the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does wish. God does not wish <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> in the sense in which foolish people think He wishes them, viz., to gratify His own pleasure. For if He had not wished that the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> He requires, as, <em> e.g</em>., a heart contrite and humbled by penitent sorrow, should be symbolized by those <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> which He was thought to desire because pleasant to Himself, the old law would never have enjoined their presentation; and they were destined to be merged when the fit opportunity arrived, in order that men might not suppose that the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> themselves, rather than the things symbolized by them, were pleasing to God or acceptable in us. Hence, in another passage from another psalm, he says, <q>If I were hungry, I would not tell you; for the world is mine and the fullness thereof. Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?</q>  as if He should say, Supposing such things were necessary to me, I would never ask you for what I have in my own hand. Then he goes on to mention what these signify: <q>Offer unto God the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise, and pay your vows unto the Most High. And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.</q>  So in another <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the High God? Shall I come before Him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Hath He showed you, O man, what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; and what does the Lord require of you, but to do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120386"><a href="../bible/mic006.htm#verse6">Micah&nbsp;6:6-8</a></span> In the words of this <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, these two things are distinguished and set forth with sufficient explicitness, that God does not require these <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for their own sakes, and that He does require the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> which they symbolize. In the epistle entitled <q>To the Hebrews</q> it is said, <q>To do good and to communicate, forget not: for with such <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> God is well pleased.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120387"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse16">Hebrews&nbsp;13:16</a></span> And so, when it is written, <q>I desire mercy rather than <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120388"><a href="../bible/hos006.htm#verse6">Hosea&nbsp;6:6</a></span> nothing else is meant than that one <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is preferred to another; for that which in common speech is called <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is only the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. Now mercy is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and therefore it is said, as I have just quoted, <q>with such <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> God is well pleased.</q> All the divine ordinances, therefore, which we read concerning the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> in the service of the tabernacle or the temple, we are to refer to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our neighbor. For <q>on these two commandments,</q> as it is written, <q>hang all the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120389"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;22:40</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; Of the True and Perfect Sacrifice.</h2>

<p>Thus a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is every work which is done that we may be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fellowship, and which has a reference to that supreme good and end in which alone we can be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> blessed.  And therefore even the mercy  we show to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, if it is not shown for God's sake, is not a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. For, though made or offered by man, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is a divine thing, as those who called it <em><a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a></em>  meant to indicate. Thus man himself, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and vowed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> in so far as he dies to the world that he may live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For this is a part of that mercy which each man shows to himself; as it is written, <q>Have mercy on your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by pleasing God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120392"><a href="../bible/sir030.htm#verse24">Sirach&nbsp;30:24</a></span> Our body, too, as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> when we chasten it by <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, if we do so as we ought, for God's sake, that we may not yield our members instruments of unrighteousness unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but instruments of righteousness unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note120393"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;6:13</a></span> Exhorting to this <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, the apostle says, <q>I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you present your bodies a living <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is your reasonable service.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120394"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;12:1</a></span> If, then, the body, which, being inferior, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> uses as a servant or instrument, is a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> when it is used rightly, and with reference to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how much more does the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself become a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> when it offers itself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that, being inflamed by the fire of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, it may receive of His beauty and become pleasing to Him, losing the shape of earthly desire, and being remoulded in the image of permanent loveliness? And this, indeed, the apostle subjoins, saying, <q>And be not conformed to this world; but be transformed in the renewing of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120395"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;12:2</a></span> Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are works of mercy to ourselves or others, done with a reference to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and since works of mercy have no other object than the relief of distress or the conferring of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and since there is no <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> apart from that good of which it is said, <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me to be very near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  it follows that the whole redeemed city, that is to say, the congregation or community of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, is offered to God as our <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> through the great High Priest, who offered Himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> for us, that we might be members of this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> head, according to the form of a servant. For it was this form He offered, in this He was offered, because it is according to it He is Mediator, in this He is our Priest, in this the Sacrifice. Accordingly, when the apostle had exhorted us to present our bodies a living <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our reasonable service, and not to be conformed to the world, but to be transformed in the renewing of our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that we might prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is to say, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of ourselves, he says, <q>For I say, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God which is given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the measure of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For, as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office, so we, being many, are one body in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and every one members one of another, having gifts differing according to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that is given to us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120397"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;12:3-6</a></span> This is the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>: we, being many, are one body in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And this also is the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> continually celebrates in the sacrament of the altar, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the faithful, in which she teaches that she herself is offered in the offering she makes to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; Of the Love of the Holy Angels, Which Prompts Them to Desire that We Worship the One True God, and Not Themselves.</h2>

<p>It is very right that these blessed and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> spirits, who inhabit celestial dwellings, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the communications of their Creator's fullness, firm in His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, assured in His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since they compassionately and tenderly regard us miserable mortals, and wish us to become <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, do not desire us to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to themselves, but to Him whose <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> themselves to be in common with us. For we and they together are the one city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to which it is said in the psalm, <q>Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q>  the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> part sojourning here below, the angelic aiding from above. For from that heavenly city, in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> is the intelligible and unchangeable law, from that heavenly council-chamber,&mdash; for they sit in counsel regarding us&mdash;that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, descended to us by the ministry of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in which it is written, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120399"><a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;22:20</a></span> &mdash; this Scripture, this law, these precepts, have been confirmed by such <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, that it is sufficiently evident to whom these <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and blessed spirits, who desire us to be like themselves, wish us to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; Of the Miracles Which God Has Condescended to Adhibit Through the Ministry of Angels, to His Promises for the Confirmation of the Faith of the Godly.</h2>

<p>I should seem tedious were I to recount all the ancient <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, which were wrought in attestation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'s promises which He made to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> thousands of years ago, that in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed. <span class="stiki" id="note120400"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse18">Genesis&nbsp;18:18</a></span> For who can but marvel that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> barren wife should have given birth to a son at an age when not even a prolific <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> could bear children; or, again, that when <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, a flame from heaven should have run between the divided parts;  or that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, whom he had hospitably entertained, and who had renewed God's promise of offspring, should also have predicted the destruction of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> by fire from heaven; <span class="stiki" id="note120402"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm">Genesis&nbsp;xviii</a></span> and that his nephew <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> should have been rescued from <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as the fire was just descending, while his wife, who looked back as she went, and was immediately turned into <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, stood as a sacred beacon warning us that no one who is being saved should long for what he is leaving? How striking also were the wonders done by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to rescue God's people from the yoke of slavery in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, that is, the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, who tyrannized over this people, were suffered to do some wonderful things that they might be vanquished all the more signally! They did these things by the magical arts and incantations to which the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> or <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are addicted; while <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, having as much greater power as he had right on his side, and having the aid of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, easily conquered them in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth. And, in fact, the magicians failed at the third plague; whereas <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, dealing out the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> delegated to him, brought ten plagues upon the land, so that the hard hearts of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> and the Egyptians yielded, and the people were let go. But, quickly repenting, and essaying to overtake the departing Hebrews, who had crossed the sea on dry ground, they were covered and overwhelmed in the returning waters. What shall I say of those frequent and stupendous exhibitions of divine power, while the people were conducted through the wilderness?&mdash; of the waters which could not be drunk, but lost their bitterness, and quenched the thirsty, when at God's command a piece of wood was cast into them? Of the manna that descended from heaven to appease their hunger, and which begot worms and putrefied when any one collected more than the appointed quantity, and yet, though double was gathered on the day before the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> (it not being lawful to gather it on that day), remained fresh? Of the birds which filled the camp, and turned appetite into satiety when they longed for flesh, which it seemed impossible to supply to so vast a population? Of the enemies who met them, and opposed their passage with arms, and were defeated without the loss of a single Hebrew, when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> with his hands extended in the form of a cross? Of the seditious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who arose among God's people, and separated themselves from the divinely-ordered community, and were swallowed up alive by the earth, a visible token of an invisible punishment? Of the rock struck with the rod, and pouring out waters more than enough for all the host? Of the deadly serpents' bites, sent in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but healed by looking at the lifted brazen serpent, so that not only were the tormented people healed, but a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the crucifixion of death set before them in this destruction of death by death? It was this serpent which was preserved in memory of this event, and was afterwards worshipped by the mistaken people as an idol, and was destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and God-fearing king Hezekiah, much to his credit.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; Of the Illicit Arts Connected with Demonolatry, and of Which the Platonist Porphyry Adopts Some, and Discards Others.</h2>

<p>These <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and many others of the same nature, which it were tedious to mention, were wrought for the purpose of commending the worship of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and prohibiting the worship of a multitude of false gods. Moreover, they were wrought by simple <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and godly confidence, not by the incantations and charms composed under the influence of a criminal tampering with the unseen world, of an art which they call either magic, or by the more abominable title necromancy,  or the more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> designation theurgy; for they wish to discriminate between those whom the people call magicians, who practise necromancy, and are addicted to illicit arts and condemned, and those others who seem to them to be worthy of praise for their practice of theurgy,&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, however, being that both classes are the slaves of the deceitful <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> whom they invoke under the names of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p> 

<p>For even Porphyry promises some kind of purgation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the help of theurgy, though he does so with some hesitation and shame, and denies that this art can secure to any one a return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so that you can detect his opinion vacillating between the profession of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and an art which he feels to be presumptuous and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a>. For at one time he warns us to avoid it as deceitful, and prohibited by law, and dangerous to those who practise it; then again, as if in deference to its advocates, he declares it useful for cleansing one part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not, indeed, the intellectual part, by which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of things intelligible, which have no sensible images, is recognized, but the spiritual part, which takes cognizance of the images of things material. This part, he says, is prepared and fitted for intercourse with spirits and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and for the vision of the gods, by the help of certain theurgic consecrations, or, as they call them, <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. He acknowledges, however, that these theurgic <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> impart to the intellectual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> no such purity as fits it to see its <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and recognize the things that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> exist. And from this acknowledgment we may infer what kind of gods these are, and what kind of vision of them is imparted by theurgic consecrations, if by it one cannot see the things which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> exist. He says, further, that the rational, or, as he prefers calling it, the intellectual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, can pass into the heavens without the spiritual part being cleansed by theurgic art, and that this art cannot so purify the spiritual part as to give it entrance to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. And therefore, although he distinguishes <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> from <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, asserting that the habitation of the latter is in the air, while the former dwell in the ether and empyrean, and although he advises us to cultivate the friendship of some <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, who may be able after our death to assist us, and elevate us at least a little above the earth&mdash;for he owns that it is by another way we must reach the heavenly society of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>&mdash;he at the same time distinctly warns us to avoid the society of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, saying that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, expiating its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after death, execrates the worship of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by whom it was entangled. And of theurgy itself, though he recommends it as reconciling <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, he cannot deny that it treats with powers which either themselves <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> its purity, or serve the arts of those who do <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> it. He complains of this through the mouth of some Chald&aelig;an or other: <q>A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man in Chald&aelig;a complains,</q> he says, <q>that his most strenuous efforts to cleanse his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were frustrated, because another man, who had influence in these matters, and who envied him purity, had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the powers, and bound them by his conjuring not to listen to his request. Therefore,</q> adds Porphyry, <q>what the one man bound, the other could not loose.</q> And from this he concludes that theurgy is a craft which accomplishes not only good but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> among gods and men; and that the gods also have <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and are perturbed and agitated by the emotions which Apuleius attributed to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and men, but from which he preserved the gods by that sublimity of residence, which, in common with <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, he accorded to them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; Concerning Theurgy, Which Promises a Delusive Purification of the Soul by the Invocation of Demons.</h2>

<p>But here we have another and a much more learned <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> than Apuleius, Porphyry, to wit, asserting that, by I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what theurgy, even the gods themselves are subjected to <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and perturbations; for by adjurations they were so bound and terrified that they could not confer purity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash;were so terrified by him who imposed on them a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> command, that they could not by the same theurgy be freed from that terror, and fulfill the righteous behest of him who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to them, or do the good he sought. Who does not see that all these things are fictions of deceiving <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, unless he be a wretched slave of theirs, and an alien from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Liberator? For if the Chald&aelig;an had been dealing with good gods, certainly a well-disposed man, who sought to purify his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, would have had more influence with them than an evil-disposed man seeking to hinder him. Or, if the gods were just, and considered the man unworthy of the purification he sought, at all events they should not have been terrified by an <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> person, nor hindered, as Porphyry avows, by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of a stronger deity, but should have simply denied the boon on their own free judgment. And it is surprising that that well-disposed Chald&aelig;an, who desired to purify his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by theurgical <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, found no superior deity who could either terrify the frightened gods still more, and force them to confer the boon, or compose their fears, and so enable them to do good without compulsion&mdash;even supposing that the good theurgist had no <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> by which he himself might purge away the taint of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> from the gods whom he invoked for the purification of his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And why is it that there is a god who has power to terrify the inferior gods, and none who has power to free them from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? Is there found a god who listens to the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> man, and frightens the  gods from doing good? And is there not found a god who listens to the well-disposed man, and removes the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the gods that they may do him good? O excellent theurgy! O admirable purification of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>!&mdash; a theurgy in which the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of an impure <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> has more influence than the entreaty of purity and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Rather let us abominate and avoid the deceit of such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits, and listen to sound doctrine. As to those who perform these filthy cleansings by <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, and see in their initiated state (as he further tells us, though we may question this vision) certain wonderfully lovely appearances of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or gods, this is what the apostle refers to when he speaks of <q><a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> transforming himself into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120404"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:14</a></span> For these are the delusive appearances of that spirit who longs to entangle wretched <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the deceptive worship of many and false gods, and to turn them aside from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worship of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whom alone they are cleansed and healed, and who, as was said of Proteus, <q>turns himself into all shapes,</q>  equally hurtful, whether he assaults us as an enemy, or assumes the disguise of a friend.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; Of Porphyry's Epistle to Anebo, in Which He Asks for Information About the Differences Among Demons.</h2>

<p>It was a better tone which Porphyry adopted in his letter to Anebo the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, in which, assuming the character of an inquirer consulting him, he unmasks and explodes these <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> arts. In that letter, indeed, he repudiates all <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, whom he maintains to be so foolish as to be attracted by the sacrificial vapors, and therefore residing not in the ether, but in the air beneath the moon, and indeed in the moon itself. Yet he has not the boldness to attribute to all the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> all the deceptions and malicious and foolish practices which <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> move his indignation. For, though he acknowledges that as a race <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are foolish, he so far accommodates himself to popular ideas as to call some of them benignant <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. He expresses surprise that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> not only incline the gods, but also compel and force them to do what men wish; and he is at a loss to understand how the sun and moon, and other visible celestial bodies&mdash;for bodies he does not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that they are&mdash;are considered gods, if the gods are distinguished from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by their incorporeality; also, if they are gods, how some are called beneficent and others hurtful, and how they, being corporeal, are numbered with the gods, who are incorporeal. He inquires further, and still as one in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a> and wonderworkers are men of unusually powerful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, or whether the power to do these things is communicated by spirits from without. He inclines to the latter opinion, on the ground that it is by the use of stones and herbs that they lay spells on people, and open closed doors, and do similar wonders. And on this account, he says, some suppose that there is a race of beings whose property it is to listen to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>&mdash;a race deceitful, full of contrivances, capable of assuming all forms, simulating gods, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and dead men,&mdash; and that it is this race which bring about all these things which have the appearance of good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but that what is really good they never help us in, and are indeed unacquainted with, for they make <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> easy, but throw obstacles in the path of those who eagerly follow <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and that they are filled with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and rashness, delight in sacrificial odors, are taken with flattery. These and the other characteristics of this race of deceitful and malicious spirits, who come into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and delude their senses, both in sleep and waking, he describes not as things of which he is himself convinced, but only with so much suspicion and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> him to speak of them as commonly received opinions. We should sympathize with this great <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> in the difficulty he experienced in acquainting himself with and confidently assailing the whole fraternity of devils, which any <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> would unhesitatingly describe and most unreservedly detest. Perhaps, however, he shrank from offending Anebo, to whom he was writing, himself the most eminent patron of these <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, or the others who marvelled at these magical feats as divine works, and closely allied to the worship of the gods.</p>

<p>However, he pursues this subject, and, still in the character of an inquirer, mentions some things which no sober judgment could attribute to any but malicious and deceitful powers. He asks why, after the better class of spirits have been invoked, the worse should be commanded to perform the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> desires of men; why they do not hear a man who has just left a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> embrace, while they themselves make no scruple of tempting men to incest and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; why their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are commanded to abstain from animal food for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of being polluted by the corporeal exhalations, while they themselves are attracted by the fumes of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and other exhalations; why the initiated are forbidden to touch a dead body, while their <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> are celebrated almost entirely by means of dead bodies; why  it is that a man addicted to any <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> should utter threats, not to a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> or to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a dead man, but to the sun and moon, or some of the heavenly bodies, which he intimidates by imaginary terrors, that he may wring from them a real boon&mdash;for he threatens that he will demolish the sky, and such like impossibilities&mdash;that those gods, being alarmed, like silly children, with imaginary and absurd threats, may do what they are ordered. Porphyry further relates that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, Ch&aelig;remon, profoundly versed in these sacred or rather <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, had written that the famous <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of Isis and her husband Osiris had very great influence with the gods to compel them to do what they were ordered, when he who used the spells threatened to divulge or do away with these <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and cried with a threatening voice that he would scatter the members of Osiris if they neglected his orders. Not without reason is Porphyry surprised that a man should utter such wild and empty threats against the gods&mdash;not against gods of no account, but against the heavenly gods, and those that shine with sidereal light&mdash;and that these threats should be effectual to constrain them with resistless power, and alarm them so that they fulfill his wishes. Not without reason does he, in the character of an inquirer into the reasons of these surprising things, give it to be understood that they are done by that race of spirits which he previously described as if quoting other people's opinions&mdash;spirits who deceive not, as he said, by nature, but by their own corruption, and who simulate gods and dead men, but not, as he said, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, for <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> they really are. As to his idea that by means of herbs, and stones, and animals, and certain incantations and noises, and drawings, sometimes fanciful, and sometimes copied from the motions of the heavenly bodies, men create upon earth powers capable of bringing about various results, all that is only the mystification which these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> practise on those who are subject to them, for the sake of furnishing themselves with merriment at the expense of their dupes. Either, then, Porphyry was sincere in his doubts and inquiries, and mentioned these things to demonstrate and put beyond question that they were the work, not of powers which aid us in obtaining life, but of deceitful <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; or, to take a more favorable view of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, he adopted this method with the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> who was wedded to these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of them, that he might not offend him by assuming the attitude of a teacher, nor discompose his mind by the altercation of a professed assailant, but, by assuming the character of an inquirer, and the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> attitude of one who was anxious to learn, might turn his attention to these matters, and show how worthy they are to be despised and relinquished. Towards the conclusion of his letter, he requests Anebo to inform him what the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> wisdom indicates as the way to blessedness. But as to those who hold intercourse with the gods, and pester them only for the sake of finding a runaway slave, or acquiring property, or making a bargain of a marriage, or such things, he declares that their pretensions to wisdom are vain. He adds that these same gods, even granting that on other points their utterances were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, were yet so ill-advised and unsatisfactory in their disclosures about blessedness, that they cannot be either gods or good <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but are either that spirit who is called the deceiver, or mere fictions of the imagination.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; Of the Miracles Wrought by the True God Through the Ministry of the Holy Angels.</h2>

<p>Since by means of these arts wonders are done which quite surpass <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power, what choice have we but to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that these predictions and operations, which seem to be miraculous and divine, and which at the same time form no part of the worship of the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in adherence to whom, as the Platonists themselves abundantly testify, all blessedness consists, are the pastime of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits, who thus seek to seduce and hinder the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> godly? On the other hand, we cannot but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that all <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, whether wrought by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or by other means, so long as they are so done as to commend the worship and religion of the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> in whom alone is blessedness, are wrought by those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> us in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and godly sort, or through their means, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself working in them. For we cannot listen to those who maintain that the invisible God works no visible <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; for even they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He made the world, which surely they will not deny to be visible. Whatever marvel happens in this world, it is certainly less marvellous than this whole world itself&mdash;I mean the sky and earth, and all that is in them&mdash;and these God certainly made. But, as the Creator Himself is hidden and incomprehensible to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so also is the manner of creation. Although, therefore, the standing <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of this visible world is little thought of, because always before us, yet, when we arouse ourselves to contemplate it, it is a greater <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> than the rarest and most unheard-of marvels. For man himself is a greater <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> than any  <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> done through his instrumentality. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made the visible heaven and earth, does not disdain to work visible <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in heaven or earth, that He may thereby awaken the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is immersed in things visible to worship Himself, the Invisible. But the place and time of these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are dependent on His unchangeable will, in which things future are ordered as if already they were accomplished. For He moves things temporal without Himself moving in time, He does not in one way <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things that are to be, and, in another, things that have been; neither does He listen to those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> otherwise than as He sees those that will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. For, even when His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> hear us, it is He Himself who hears us in them, as in His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> temple not made with hands, as in those men who are His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; and His answers, though accomplished in time, have been arranged by His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> appointment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; Of the Invisible God, Who Has Often Made Himself Visible, Not as He Really Is, But as the Beholders Could Bear the Sight.</h2>

<p>Neither need we be surprised that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, invisible as He is, should often have appeared visibly to the patriarchs. For as the sound which communicates the thought conceived in the silence of the mind is not the thought itself, so the form by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, invisible in His own nature, became visible, was not God Himself. Nevertheless it is He Himself who was seen under that form, as that thought itself is heard in the sound of the voice; and the patriarchs recognized that, though the bodily form was not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they saw the invisible God. For, though <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> conversed with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet he said, <q>If I have found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in Your sight, show me Yourself, that I may see and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120406"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse13">Exodus&nbsp;33:13</a></span> And as it was fit that the law, which was given, not to one man or a few enlightened men, but to the whole of a populous nation, should be accompanied by awe-inspiring signs, great marvels were wrought, by the ministry of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, before the people on the mount where the law was being given to them through one man, while the multitude beheld the awful appearances. For the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, not as the Laced&aelig;monians <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> their Lycurgus, because he had received from Jupiter or Apollo the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> he gave them. For when the law which enjoined the worship of one God was given to the people, marvellous signs and earthquakes, such as the divine wisdom judged sufficient, were brought about in the sight of all, that they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it was the Creator who could thus use creation to promulgate His law.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; That the One God is to Be Worshipped Not Only for the Sake of Eternal Blessings, But Also in Connection with Temporal Prosperity, Because All Things are Regulated by His Providence.</h2>

<p>The education of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, represented by the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has advanced, like that of an individual, through certain epochs, or, as it were, ages, so that it might gradually rise from earthly to heavenly things, and from the visible to the invisible. This object was kept so clearly in view, that, even in the period when temporal rewards were promised, the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> was presented as the object of worship, that men might not acknowledge any other than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Creator and Lord of the spirit, even in connection with the earthly blessings of this transitory life. For he who denies that all things, which either <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or men can give us, are in the hand of the one Almighty, is a madman. The <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> Plotinus discourses concerning <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, and, from the beauty of flowers and foliage, proves that from the supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose beauty is unseen and ineffable, <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> reaches down even to these earthly things here below; and he argues that all these frail and perishing things could not have so exquisite and elaborate a beauty, were they not fashioned by Him whose unseen and unchangeable beauty continually pervades all things.  This is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> also by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, where He says, <q>Consider the lilies, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin. And yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more shall He clothe you, O you of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120408"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;6:28-30</a></span> It was best, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which was still weakly desiring earthly things, should be accustomed to seek from God alone even these petty temporal boons, and the earthly necessaries of this transitory life, which are contemptible in comparison with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessings, in order that the desire even of these things might not draw it aside from the worship of Him, to whom we come by despising and forsaking such things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; Of the Ministry of the Holy Angels, by Which They Fulfill the Providence of God.</h2>

<p>And so it has pleased <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, as I have said, and as we read in the Acts of the Apostles, <span class="stiki" id="note120409"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse53">Acts&nbsp;7:53</a></span> that the law enjoining the worship of one God should be given by the disposition of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But among them the person of God Himself visibly appeared, not, indeed, in His proper substance, which ever remains invisible to mortal eyes, but by the infallible signs furnished by creation in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to its Creator. He made use, too, of the words of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> speech, uttering them syllable by syllable successively, though in His own nature He speaks not in a bodily but in a spiritual way; not to sense, but to the mind; not in words that occupy time, but, if I may so say, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, neither beginning to speak nor coming to an end. And what He says is accurately heard, not by the bodily but by the mental ear of His ministers and messengers, who are immortally <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the enjoyment of His unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and the directions which they in some ineffable way receive, they execute without delay or difficulty in the sensible and visible world. And this law was given in conformity with the age of the world, and contained at the first earthly promises, as I have said, which, however, symbolized <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> ones; and these <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessings few understood, though many took a part in the celebration of their visible signs. Nevertheless, with one consent both the words and the visible <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of that law enjoin the worship of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;not one of a crowd of gods, but Him who made heaven and earth, and every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and every spirit which is other than Himself. He created; all else was created; and, both for being and well-being, all things need Him who created them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; Whether Those Angels Who Demand that We Pay Them Divine Honor, or Those Who Teach Us to Render Holy Service, Not to Themselves, But to God, are to Be Trusted About the Way to Life Eternal.</h2>

<p>What <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, then, are we to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in this matter of blessed and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life?&mdash; those who wish to be worshipped with religious <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> and observances, and require that men <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to them; or those who say that all this worship is due to one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator, and teach us to render it with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to Him, by the vision of whom they are themselves already blessed, and in whom they promise that we shall be so? For that vision of God is the beauty of a vision so great, and is so infinitely desirable, that Plotinus does not hesitate to say that he who enjoys all other blessings in abundance, and has not this, is supremely miserable.  Since, therefore, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are wrought by some <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to induce us to worship this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by others, to induce us to worship themselves; and since the former forbid us to worship these, while the latter dare not forbid us to worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which are we to listen to? Let the Platonists reply, or any <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, or the theurgists, or rather, <em>periurgists</em>, &mdash; for this name is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> enough for those who practise such arts. In short, let all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> answer&mdash;if, at least, there survives in them any spark of that natural perception which, as rational beings, they possess when created,&mdash; let them, I say, tell us whether we should <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the gods or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who order us to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to them, or to that One to whom we are ordered to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> by those who forbid us to worship either themselves or these others. If neither the one party nor the other had wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but had merely uttered commands, the one to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to themselves, the other forbidding that, and ordering us to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a godly mind would have been at no loss to discern which command proceeded from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> arrogance, and which from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. I will say more. If <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> had been wrought only by those who demand <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for themselves, while those who forbade this, and enjoined <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> only, thought fit entirely to forego the use of visible <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, the authority of the latter was to be preferred by all who would use, not their eyes only, but their reason. But since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the sake of commending to us the oracles of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, has, by means of these <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> messengers, who proclaim His majesty and not their own <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of surpassing grandeur, certainty, and distinctness, in order that the weak among the godly might not be drawn away to false religion by those who require us to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to them and endeavor to convince us by stupendous appeals to our senses, who is so utterly unreasonable as not to choose and follow the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when he finds that it is heralded by even more striking evidences than <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>?</p>

<p>As for those <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which history ascribes to the gods of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>&mdash;I do not refer to those prodigies which at intervals happen from some unknown physical causes, and which are arranged and appointed by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, such as monstrous births, and unusual meteorological phenomena, whether startling only,  or also injurious, and which are said to be brought about and removed by communication with <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and by their most deceitful craft&mdash;but I refer to these prodigies which manifestly enough are wrought by their power and force, as, that the household gods which &AElig;neas carried from Troy in his flight moved from place to place; that Tarquin cut a whetstone with a razor; that the Epidaurian serpent attached himself as a companion to &AElig;sculapius on his voyage to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; that the ship in which the image of the Phrygian mother stood, and which could not be moved by a host of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and oxen, was moved by one weak <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who attached her girdle to the vessel and drew it, as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; that a vestal, whose <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> was questioned, removed the suspicion by carrying from the Tiber a sieve full of water without any of it dropping: these, then, and the like, are by no means to be compared for greatness and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to those which, we read, were wrought among God's people. How much less can we compare those marvels, which even the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> nations prohibit and punish&mdash;I mean the magical and theurgic marvels, of which the great part are merely illusions practised upon the senses, as the drawing down of the moon, <q>that,</q> as Lucan says, <q>it may shed a stronger influence on the plants?</q>  And if some of these do seem to equal those which are wrought by the godly, the end for which they are wrought distinguishes the two, and shows that ours are incomparably the more excellent. For those <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> commend the worship of a plurality of gods, who deserve worship the less the more they demand it; but these of ours commend the worship of the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who, both by the testimony of His own Scriptures, and by the eventual abolition of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, proves that He needs no such offerings. If, therefore, any <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> demand <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for themselves, we must prefer those who demand it, not for themselves, but for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator of all, whom they serve. For thus they prove how sincerely they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> us, since they wish by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to subject us, not to themselves, but to Him by the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of whom they themselves are blessed, and to bring us to Him from whom they themselves have never strayed. If, on the other hand, any <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> wish us to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, not to one, but to many, not, indeed, to themselves, but to the gods whose <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> they are, we must in this case also prefer those who are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> of gods, and who so bid us to worship Him as to preclude our worshipping any other. But, further, if it be the case, as their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and deceitfulness rather indicate, that they are neither good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> nor the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of good gods, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who wish <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to be paid, not to the one only and supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to themselves, what better protection against them can we choose than that of the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> whom the good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> serve, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who bid us <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, not to themselves, but to Him whose <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> we ourselves ought to be?</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.&mdash; Concerning the Ark of the Covenant, and the Miraculous Signs Whereby God Authenticated the Law and the Promise.</h2>

<p>On this account it was that the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, given by the disposition of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and which commanded that the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> of gods alone receive sacred worship, to the exclusion of all others, was deposited in the ark, called the ark of the testimony. By this name it is sufficiently indicated, not that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who was worshipped by all those <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, was shut up and enclosed in that place, though His responses emanated from it along with signs appreciable by the senses, but that His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> was declared from that throne. The law itself, too, was engraven on tables of stone, and, as I have said, deposited in the ark, which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> carried with due reverence during the sojourn in the wilderness, along with the tabernacle, which was in like manner called the tabernacle of the testimony; and there was then an accompanying sign, which appeared as a cloud by day and as a fire by night; when the cloud moved, the camp was shifted, and where it stood the camp was pitched. Besides these signs, and the voices which proceeded from the place where the ark was, there were other miraculous testimonies to the law. For when the ark was carried across Jordan, on the entrance to the land of promise, the upper part of the river stopped in its course, and the lower part flowed on, so as to present both to the ark and the people dry ground to pass over. Then, when it was carried seven times round the first hostile and polytheistic city they came to, its walls suddenly fell down, though assaulted by no hand, struck by no battering-ram. Afterwards, too, when they were now resident in the land of promise, and the ark had, in punishment of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, been taken by their enemies, its captors triumphantly placed it in the temple of their favorite god, and left it shut up there, but, on opening the temple next day, they found the image they used to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to fallen to the ground and shamefully shattered. Then, being them  selves alarmed by portents, and still more shamefully punished, they restored the ark of the testimony to the people from whom they had taken it. And what was the manner of its restoration? They placed it on a wagon, and yoked to it cows from which they had taken the calves, and let them choose their own course, expecting that in this way the divine will would be indicated; and the cows without any man driving or directing them, steadily pursued the way to the Hebrews, without regarding the lowing of their calves, and thus restored the ark to its worshippers. To God these and such like wonders are small, but they are mighty to terrify and give wholesome instruction to men. For if <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and especially the Platonists, are with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> esteemed wiser than other men, as I have just been mentioning, because they taught that even these earthly and insignificant things are ruled by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, inferring this from the numberless beauties which are observable not only in the bodies of animals, but even in plants and grasses, how much more plainly do these things attest the presence of divinity which happen at the time predicted, and in which that religion is commended which forbids the offering of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to any celestial, terrestrial, or infernal being, and commands it to be offered to God only, who alone blesses us by His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for us, and by our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to Him, and who, by arranging the appointed times of those <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and by predicting that they were to pass into a better <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> by a better Priest, testified that He has no appetite for these <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, but through them indicated others of more substantial blessing,&mdash; and all this not that He Himself may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by these <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, but that we may be stirred up to worship and cleave to Him, being inflamed by His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which is our advantage rather than His?</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; Against Those Who Deny that the Books of the Church are to Be Believed About the Miracles Whereby the People of God Were Educated.</h2>

<p>Will some one say that these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are false, that they never happened, and that the records of them are lies? Whoever says so, and asserts that in such matters no records whatever can be credited, may also say that there are no gods who care for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs. For they have induced men to worship them only by means of miraculous works, which the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> histories testify, and by which the gods have made a display of their own power rather than done any real service. This is the reason why we have not undertaken in this work, of which we are now writing the tenth book, to refute those who either deny that there is any divine power, or contend that it does not interfere with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, but those who prefer their own god to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Founder of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> city, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that He is also the invisible and unchangeable Founder of this visible and changing world, and the truest bestower of the blessed life which resides not in things created, but in Himself. For thus speaks His most trustworthy <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me to be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Among <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> it is a question, what is that end and good to the attainment of which all our duties are to have a relation? The Psalmist did not say, It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me to have great <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, or to wear imperial insignia, purple, sceptre, and diadem; or, as some even of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have not blushed to say, It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me to enjoy sensual pleasure; or, as the better men among them seemed to say, My good is my spiritual strength; but, <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me to be united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> This he had learned from Him whom the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, with the accompanying <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, presented as the sole object of worship. And hence he himself became the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose spiritual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> inflamed him, and into whose ineffable and incorporeal embrace he yearned to cast himself. Moreover, if the worshippers of many gods (whatever kind of gods they fancy their own to be) <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> recorded in their civil histories, or in the books of magic, or of the more respectable theurgy, were wrought by these gods, what reason have they for refusing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> recorded in those writings, to which we owe a credence as much greater as He is greater to whom alone these writings teach us to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; On the Reasonableness of Offering, as the True Religion Teaches, a Visible Sacrifice to the One True and Invisible God.</h2>

<p>As to those who think that these visible <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are suitably offered to other gods, but that invisible <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, the graces of purity of mind and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of will, should be offered, as greater and better, to the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Himself greater and better than all others, they must be oblivious that these visible <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are signs of the invisible, as the words we utter are the signs of things. And therefore, as in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> or praise we direct intelligible words to Him to whom in our heart  we offer the very feelings we are expressing, so we are to understand that in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> we offer visible <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> only to Him to whom in our heart we ought to present ourselves an invisible <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. It is then that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and all those superior powers who are mighty by their goodness and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, regard us with pleasure, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with us and assist us to the utmost of their power. But if we offer such worship to them, they decline it; and when on any mission to men they become visible to the senses, they positively forbid it. Examples of this occur in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writ. Some fancied they should, by adoration or <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, pay the same <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as is due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and were prevented from doing so by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> themselves, and ordered to render it to Him to whom alone they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it to be due. And the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have in this been imitated by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>, when they had wrought a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of healing in Lycaonia, were thought to be gods, and the Lycaonians desired to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to them, and they humbly and piously declined this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and announced to them the God in whom they should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. And those deceitful and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> spirits, who exact worship, do so simply because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it to be due to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. For that which they take pleasure in is not, as Porphyry says and some fancy, the smell of the victims, but divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>. They have, in fact, plenty odors on all hands, and if they wished more, they could provide them for themselves. But the spirits who arrogate to themselves divinity are delighted not with the smoke of carcasses but with the suppliant spirit which they deceive and hold in subjection, and hinder from drawing near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, preventing him from offering himself in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to God by inducing him to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to others.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; Of the Supreme and True Sacrifice Which Was Effected by the Mediator Between God and Men.</h2>

<p>And hence that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Mediator, in so far as, by assuming the form of a servant, He became the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, though in the form of God He received <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> together with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, with whom He is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, yet in the form of a servant He chose rather to be than to receive a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, that not even by this instance any one might have occasion to suppose that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> should be rendered to any creature. Thus He is both the Priest who offers and the Sacrifice offered. And He designed that there should be a daily sign of this in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which, being His body, learns to offer herself through Him. Of this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Sacrifice the ancient <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were the various and numerous signs; and it was thus variously figured, just as one thing is signified by a variety of words, that there may be less weariness when we speak of it much. To this supreme and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> all false <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> have given place.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21 .&mdash; Of the Power Delegated to Demons for the Trial and Glorification of the Saints, Who Conquer Not by Propitiating the Spirits of the Air, But by Abiding in God.</h2>

<p>The power delegated to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> at certain appointed and well-adjusted seasons, that they may give expression to their hostility to the city of God by stirring up against it the men who are under their influence, and may not only receive <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> from those who willingly offer it, but may also extort it from the unwilling by violent <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>&mdash;this power is found to be not merely harmless, but even useful to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, completing as it does the number of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, whom the city of God esteems as all the more illustrious and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> citizens, because they have striven even to blood against the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of impiety. If the ordinary language of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> allowed it, we might more elegantly call these men our heroes. For this name is said to be derived from Juno, who in Greek is called H&ecirc;r&ecirc;, and hence, according to the Greek myths, one of her sons was called Heros. And these fables <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> signified that Juno was mistress of the air, which they suppose to be inhabited by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and the heroes, understanding by heroes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the well-deserving dead. But for a quite opposite reason would we call our <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> heroes,&mdash; supposing, as I said, that the usage of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> language would admit of it&mdash;not because they lived along with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> in the air, but because they conquered these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> or powers of the air, and among them Juno herself, be she what she may, not unsuitably represented, as she commonly is by the poets, as hostile to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and jealous of men of mark aspiring to the heavens. Virgil, however, unhappily gives way, and yields to her; for, though he represents her as saying, <q>I am conquered by &AElig;neas,</q>  Helenus gives &AElig;neas himself this religious advice:</p>

<blockquote><p>Pay vows to Juno: overbear<br>
Her queenly <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with gift and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. </p></blockquote>

<p>In conformity with this opinion, Porphyry&mdash;  expressing, however, not so much his own views as other people's&mdash; says that a good god or genius cannot come to a man unless the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> genius has been first of all propitiated, implying that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deities had greater power than the good; for, until they have been appeased and give place, the good can give no assistance; and if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deities oppose, the good can give no help; whereas the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> can do injury without the good being able to prevent them. This is not the way of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion; not thus do our <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> conquer Juno, that is to say, the powers of the air, who <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>. Our heroes, if we could so call them, overcome H&ecirc;r&ecirc;, not by suppliant gifts, but by divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. As Scipio, who conquered Africa by his valor, is more suitably styled <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Africanus</a> than if he had appeased his enemies by gifts, and so won their mercy.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; Whence the Saints Derive Power Against Demons and True Purification of Heart.</h2>

<p>It is by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> that men of God cast out the hostile power of the air which opposes godliness; it is by exorcising it, not by propitiating it; and they overcome all the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of the adversary by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, not to him, but to their own God against him. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> cannot conquer or subdue any but those who are in league with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and therefore he is conquered in the name of Him who assumed humanity, and that without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that Himself being both Priest and Sacrifice, He might bring about the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that is to say, might bring it about through the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, by whom we are reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the cleansing from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> being accomplished. For men are separated from God only by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, from which we are in this life cleansed not by our own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but by the divine compassion; through His indulgence, not through our own power. For, whatever <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> we call our own is itself bestowed upon us by His goodness. And we might attribute too much to ourselves while in the flesh, unless we lived in the receipt of pardon until we laid it down. This is the reason why there has been vouchsafed to us, through the Mediator, this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that we who are polluted by sinful flesh should be cleansed by the likeness of sinful flesh. By this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wherein He has shown His great compassion toward us, we are both governed by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in this life, and, after this life, are led onwards to the fullest perfection by the vision of immutable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.&mdash; Of the Principles Which, According to the Platonists, Regulate the Purification of the Soul.</h2>

<p>Even Porphyry asserts that it was revealed by divine oracles that we are not purified by any <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>  to sun or moon, meaning it to be inferred that we are not purified by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> to any gods. For what <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> can purify, if those of the sun and moon, which are esteemed the chief of the celestial gods, do not purify? He says, too, in the same place, that <q>principles</q> can purify, lest it should be supposed, from his saying that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> to the sun and moon cannot purify, that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> to some other of the host of gods might do so. And what he as a <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> means by <q>principles,</q> we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.  For he speaks of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, whom he calls (writing in Greek) the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or mind of the Father;  but of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> he says either nothing, or nothing plainly, for I do not understand what other he speaks of as holding the middle place between these two. For if, like Plotinus in his discussion regarding the three principal substances,  he wished us to understand by this third the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of nature, he would certainly not have given it the middle place between these two, that is, between the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. For Plotinus places the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of nature after the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, while Porphyry, making it the mean, does not place it after, but between the others. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he spoke according to his light, or as he thought expedient; but we assert that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is the Spirit not of the Father only, nor of the Son only, but of both. For <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> speak as they have a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to, and in the most difficult matters do not scruple to offend religious ears; but we are bound to speak according to a certain rule, lest freedom of speech beget impiety of opinion about the matters themselves of which we speak.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.&mdash; Of the One Only True Principle Which Alone Purifies and Renews Human Nature.</h2>

<p>Accordingly, when we speak of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we do not affirm two or three principles, no more than we are at liberty to affirm two or three  gods; although, speaking of each, of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, we confess that each is God: and yet we do not say, as the Sabellian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> say, that the Father is the same as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> the same as the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; but we say that the Father is the Father of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the Son the Son of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is neither the Father nor the Son. It was therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said that man is cleansed only by a Principle, although the Platonists erred in speaking in the plural of <em>principles</em>. But Porphyry, being under the dominion of these <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> powers, whose influence he was at once ashamed of and afraid to throw off, refused to recognize that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Principle by whose <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> we are purified. Indeed he despised Him, because of the flesh itself which He assumed, that He might offer a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for our purification&mdash;a great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, unintelligible to Porphyry's <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and benignant Redeemer brought low by His humility, manifesting Himself to mortals by the mortality which He assumed, and which the malignant and deceitful mediators are <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of wanting, promising, as the boon of immortals, a deceptive assistance to wretched men. Thus the good and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Mediator showed that it is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and not the substance or nature of flesh; for this, together with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, could without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be both assumed and retained, and laid down in death, and changed to something better by resurrection. He showed also that death itself, although the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, was submitted to by Him for our sakes without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and must not be evaded by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on our part, but rather, if opportunity serves, be borne for righteousness' sake. For he was able to expiate <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by dying, because He both died, and not for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of His own. But He has not been recognized by Porphyry as the Principle, otherwise he would have recognized Him as the Purifier. The Principle is neither the flesh nor the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in Christ but the Word by which all things were made. The flesh, therefore, does not by its own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> purify, but by virtue of the Word by which it was assumed, when <q>the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120420"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> For speaking <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> of eating His flesh, when those who did not understand Him were offended and went away, saying, <q>This is an hard saying, who can hear it?</q> He answered to the rest who remained, <q>It is the Spirit that quickens; the flesh profits nothing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120421"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse60">John&nbsp;6:60-64</a></span> The Principle, therefore, having assumed a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and flesh, cleanses the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and flesh of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. Therefore, when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> asked Him who He was, He answered that He was the <em>Principle</em>.  And this we carnal and feeble men, liable to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and involved in the darkness of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, could not possibly understand, unless we were cleansed and healed by Him, both by means of what we were, and of what we were not. For we were men, but we were not righteous; whereas in His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> there was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but it was righteous, and not sinful. This is the mediation whereby a hand is stretched to the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a> and fallen; this is the seed <q>ordained by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q> by whose ministry the law also was given enjoining the worship of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and promising that this Mediator should come.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25.&mdash; That All the Saints, Both Under the Law and Before It, Were Justified by Faith in the Mystery of Christ's Incarnation.</h2>

<p>It was by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, and godliness of life, that purification was attainable even by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of old, whether before the law was given to the Hebrews (for God and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were even then present as instructors), or in the periods under the law, although the promises of spiritual things, being presented in figure, seemed to be carnal, and hence the name of <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. For it was then the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> lived, by whom, as by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, the same promise was announced; and among them was he whose grand and divine sentiment regarding the end and supreme good of man I have just now quoted, <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me to cleave to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  In this psalm the distinction between the Old and New Testaments is distinctly announced. For the Psalmist says, that when he saw that the carnal and earthly promises were abundantly enjoyed by the ungodly, his feet were almost gone, his steps had nearly slipped; and that it seemed to him as if he had served God in vain, when he saw that those who despised God increased in that prosperity which he looked for at God's hand. He says, too, that, in investigating this matter with the desire of understanding why it was so, he had labored in vain, until he went into the sanctuary of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and understood the end of those whom he had erroneously considered <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. Then he understood that they were cast down by that very thing, as he says, which they had made their boast, and that they had been consumed and perished for their inequities; and  that that whole fabric of temporal prosperity had become as a dream when one awakes, and suddenly finds himself destitute of all the joys he had imaged in sleep. And, as in this earth or earthy city they seemed to themselves to be great, he says, <q>O Lord, in Your city You will reduce their image to nothing.</q> He also shows how beneficial it had been for him to seek even earthly blessings only from the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whose power are all things, for he says, <q>As a beast was I before You, and I am always with You.</q> <q>As a beast,</q> he says, meaning that he was stupid. For I ought to have sought from You such things as the ungodly could not enjoy as well as I, and not those things which I saw them enjoying in abundance, and hence concluded I was serving You in vain, because they who declined to serve You had what I had not. Nevertheless, <q>I am always with You,</q> because even in my desire for such things I did not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to other gods. And consequently he goes on, <q>You have held   me by my right hand, and by Your counsel You have guided me, and with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> have taken me up;</q> as if all earthly advantages were left-hand blessings, though, when he saw them enjoyed by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, his feet had almost gone. <q>For what,</q> he says, <q>have I in heaven, and what have I desired from You upon earth?</q> He blames himself, and is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> displeased with himself; because, though he had in heaven so vast a possession (as he afterwards understood), he yet sought from his God on earth a transitory and fleeting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>&mdash;a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of mire, we may say. <q>My heart and my flesh,</q> he says, <q>fail, O God of my heart.</q> Happy failure, from things below to things above! And hence in another psalm He says, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> longs, yea, even fails, for the courts of the Lord.</q>  Yet, though he had said of both his heart and his flesh that they were failing, he did not say, O God of my heart and my flesh, but, O God of my heart; for by the heart the flesh is made clean. Therefore, says the Lord, <q>Cleanse that which is within, and the outside shall be clean also.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120425"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;23:26</a></span> He then says that God Himself&mdash;not anything received from Him, but Himself&mdash;is his portion. <q>The God of my heart, and my portion for ever.</q> Among the various objects of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> choice, God alone satisfied him. <q>For, lo,</q> he says, <q>they that are far from You shall perish: You destroy all them that go a-whoring from You,</q>&mdash; that is, who prostitute themselves to many gods. And then follows the verse for which all the rest of the psalm seems to prepare: <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me to cleave to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>&mdash; not to go far off; not to go a-whoring with a multitude of gods. And then shall this union with God be perfected, when all that is to be redeemed in us has been redeemed. But for the present we must, as he goes on to say, <q>place our hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <q>For that which is seen,</q> says the apostle, <q>is not hope. For what a man sees, why does he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120426"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;8:24-25</a></span> Being, then, for the present established in this hope, let us do what the Psalmist further indicates, and become in our measure <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or messengers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, declaring His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and praising His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For when he had said, <q>To place my hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> he goes on, <q>that I may declare all Your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion.</q> This is the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; this is the city which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and worships one God: she is celebrated by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who invite us to their society, and desire us to become fellow citizens with them in this city; for they do not wish us to worship them as our gods, but to join them in worshipping their God and ours; nor to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to them, but, together with them, to become a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Accordingly, whoever will lay aside malignant obstinacy, and consider these things, shall be assured that all these blessed and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> spirits, who do not <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> us (for if they envied they were not blessed), but rather <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> us, and desire us to be as blessed as themselves, look on us with greater pleasure, and give us greater assistance, when we join them in worshipping one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, than if we were to offer to themselves <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and worship.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.&mdash; Of Porphyry's Weakness in Wavering Between the Confession of the True God and the Worship of Demons.</h2>

<p>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how it is so, but it seems to me that Porphyry blushed for his friends the theurgists; for he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all that I have adduced, but did not frankly condemn polytheistic worship. He said, in fact, that there are some <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who visit earth, and reveal divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to theurgists, and others who publish on earth the things that belong to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, His height and depth. Can we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, then, that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> whose office it is to declare the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, wish us to be subject to any but Him whose will they declare? And hence, even this <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> himself judiciously  observes that we should rather imitate than invoke them. We ought not, then, to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that we may offend these <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> subjects of the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> by not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> to them; for this they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be due only to the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in allegiance to whom they themselves find their blessedness, and therefore they will not have it given to them, either in figure or in the reality, which the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> symbolized. Such arrogance belongs to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and wretched <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, whose disposition is diametrically opposite to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of those who are subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and whose blessedness consists in attachment to Him. And, that we also may attain to this bliss, they aid us, as is fit, with sincere kindliness, and usurp over us no dominion, but declare to us Him under whose rule we are then fellow-subjects. Why, then, O <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, do you still <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to speak freely against the powers which are inimical both to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and to the gifts of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God? Already you have discriminated between the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who proclaim <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and those who visit theurgists, drawn down by I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what art. Why do you still ascribe to these latter the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of declaring divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? If they do not declare the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, what divine revelations can they make? Are not these the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> who were bound over by the incantations of an <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> man,  that they should not grant purity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to another, and could not, as you say, be set free from these bonds by a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man anxious for purity, and recover power over their own actions? Do you still <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether these are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; or do you, perhaps, feign <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, that you may not give offense to the theurgists, who have allured you by their secret <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, and have taught you, as a mighty boon, these insane and pernicious devilries? Do you dare to elevate above the air, and even to heaven, these <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> powers, or pests, let me rather call them, less worthy of the name of sovereign than of slave, as you yourself own; and are you not ashamed to place them even among your sidereal gods, and so put a slight upon the stars themselves?</p>

<h2>Chapter 27.&mdash; Of the Impiety of Porphyry, Which is Worse Than Even the Mistake of Apuleius.</h2>

<p>How much more tolerable and accordant with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feeling is the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of your <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> co-sectary Apuleius! For he attributed the diseases and storms of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> only to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who occupy a grade beneath the moon, and makes even this avowal as by constraint regarding gods whom he <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>; but the superior and celestial gods, who inhabit the ethereal regions, whether visible, as the sun, moon, and other luminaries, whose brilliancy makes them conspicuous, or invisible, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in by him, he does his utmost to remove beyond the slightest stain of these perturbations. It is not, then, from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, but from your Chald&aelig;an teachers you have learned to elevate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> to the ethereal and empyreal regions of the world and to the celestial firmament, in order that your theurgists might be able to obtain from your gods divine revelations; and yet you make yourself superior to these divine revelations by your intellectual life, which dispenses with these theurgic purifications as not needed by a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. But, by way of rewarding your teachers, you recommend these arts to other men, who, not being <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, may be persuaded to use what you acknowledge to be useless to yourself, who are capable of higher things; so that those who cannot avail themselves of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, which is too arduous for the multitude, may, at your instigation, betake themselves to theurgists by whom they may be purified, not, indeed, in the intellectual, but in the spiritual part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now, as the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are unfit for <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> form incomparably the majority of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, more may be compelled to consult these secret and illicit teachers of yours than frequent the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> schools. For these most impure <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, pretending to be ethereal gods, whose herald and messenger you have become, have promised that those who are purified by theurgy in the spiritual part of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall not indeed return to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but shall dwell among the ethereal gods above the aerial regions. But such fancies are not listened to by the multitudes of men whom Christ came to set free from the tyranny of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For in Him they have the most gracious cleansing, in which <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, spirit, and body alike participate. For, in order that He might heal the whole man from the plague of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He took without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Would that you had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him, and would that you had committed yourself for healing to Him rather than to your own frail and infirm <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or to pernicious and curious arts! He would not have deceived you; for Him your own oracles, on your own showing, acknowledged <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. It is of Him, too, that the most famous poet speaks, poetically indeed, since he applies it to the person of another, yet <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, if you refer it to Christ , saying, <q>Under your auspices, if any traces of our crimes remain, they shall be obliterated, and earth freed from its perpetual <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q>  By which he indicates that, by reason of the infirmity which attaches to this life, the greatest progress in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and righteousness leaves room for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, if not of crimes, yet of the traces of crimes, which are obliterated only by that Saviour of whom this verse speaks. For that he did not say this at the prompting of his own fancy, Virgil tells us in almost the last verse of that 4th Eclogue, when he says, <q>The last age predicted by the Cum&aelig;an sibyl has now arrived;</q> whence it plainly appears that this had been dictated by the Cum&aelig;an sibyl. But those theurgists, or rather <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, who assume the appearance and form of gods, pollute rather than purify the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> spirit by false appearances and the delusive mockery of unsubstantial forms. How can those whose own spirit is unclean cleanse the spirit of man? Were they not unclean, they would not be bound by the incantations of an <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> man, and would neither be afraid nor grudge to bestow that hollow boon which they promise. But it is sufficient for our purpose that you acknowledge that the intellectual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that is, our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, cannot be justified by theurgy; and that even the spiritual or inferior part of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot by this act be made <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, though you maintain that it can be purified by it. Christ, however, promises life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; and therefore to Him the world flocks, greatly to your indignation, greatly also to your astonishment and confusion. What avails your forced avowal that theurgy leads men astray, and deceives vast numbers by its <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and foolish teaching, and that it is the most manifest mistake to have recourse by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and principalities, when at the same time, to save yourself from the charge of spending labor in vain on such arts, you direct men to the theurgists, that by their means men, who do not live by the rule of the intellectual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, may have their spiritual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> purified?</p>

<h2>Chapter 28.&mdash; How It is that Porphyry Has Been So Blind as Not to Recognize the True Wisdom&mdash; Christ.</h2>

<p>You drive men, therefore, into the most palpable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. And yet you are not ashamed of doing so much harm, though you call yourself a lover of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and wisdom. Had you been <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and faithful in this profession, you would have recognized Christ, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and would not, in the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of vain science, have revolted from His wholesome humility. Nevertheless you acknowledge that the spiritual part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can be purified by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> without the aid of those theurgic arts and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> which you wasted your time in learning. You even say, sometimes, that these <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> do not raise the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after death, so that, after the termination of this life, they seem to be of no service even to the part you call spiritual; and yet you recur on every opportunity to these arts, for no other purpose, so far as I see, than to appear an accomplished theurgist, and gratify those who are curious in illicit arts, or else to inspire others with the same curiosity. But we give you all praise for saying that this art is to be feared, both on account of the legal enactments against it, and by reason of the danger involved in the very practice of it. And would that in this, at least, you were listened to by its wretched votaries, that they might be withdrawn from entire absorption in it, or might even be preserved from tampering with it at all! You say, indeed, that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and the numberless <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> resulting from it, cannot be removed by any <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, but only by the <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F78;&#x03C2; &#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6;&#x03C2;</span>, that is, the Father's mind or <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> conscious of the Father's will. But that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is this mind you do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; for Him you despise on account of the body He took of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and the shame of the cross; for your lofty wisdom spurns such low and contemptible things, and soars to more exalted regions. But He fulfills what the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> predicted regarding Him: <q>I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nought the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120429"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;29:14</a></span> For He does not destroy and bring to nought His own gift in them, but what they arrogate to themselves, and do not hold of Him. And hence the apostle, having quoted this testimony from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, adds, <q>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that, in the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the world by wisdom <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, unto the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a stumbling-block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks, Christ the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger  than men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120430"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:19-25</a></span> This is despised as a weak and foolish thing by those who are wise and strong in themselves; yet this is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which heals the weak, who do not proudly boast a blessedness of their own, but rather humbly acknowledge their real misery.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29.&mdash; Of the Incarnation of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Which the Platonists in Their Impiety Blush to Acknowledge.</h2>

<p>You proclaim the Father and His Son, whom you call the Father's <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and between these a third, by whom we suppose you mean the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and in your own fashion you call these three Gods. In this, though your expressions are inaccurate, you do in some sort, and as through a veil, see what we should strive towards; but the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, whereby we are saved, and are enabled to reach the things we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, or in part understand, this is what you refuse to recognize. You see in a fashion, although at a distance, although with filmy eye, the country in which we should abide; but the way to it you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. Yet you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for you say it is granted to few to reach God by virtue of intelligence. For you do not say, <q>Few have thought fit or have wished,</q> but, <q>It has been granted to few,</q>&mdash; distinctly acknowledging God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not man's sufficiency. You also use this word more expressly, when, in accordance with the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, you make no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that in this life a man cannot by any means attain to perfect wisdom, but that whatever is lacking is in the future life made up to those who live intellectually, by God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Oh, had you but recognized the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, and that very <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of His, wherein He assumed a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, you might have seemed the brightest example of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>!  But what am I doing? I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it is useless to speak to a dead man&mdash;useless, at least, so far as regards you, but perhaps not in vain for those who esteem you highly, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you on account of their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of wisdom or curiosity about those arts which you ought not to have learned; and these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> I address in your name. The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God could not have been more graciously commended to us than thus, that the only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, remaining unchangeable in Himself, should assume humanity, and should give us the hope of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, by means of the mediation of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, through which we, from the condition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, might come to Him who was so far off&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> from the mortal; the unchangeable from the changeable; the just from the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>; the blessed from the wretched. And, as He had given us a natural instinct to desire blessedness and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, He Himself continuing to be blessed; but assuming mortality, by enduring what we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, taught us to despise it, that what we long for He might bestow upon us.</p>

<p>But in order to your acquiescence in this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, it is lowliness that is requisite, and to this it is extremely difficult to bend you. For what is there incredible, especially to men like you, accustomed to speculation, which might have predisposed you to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in this&mdash;what is there incredible, I say, in the assertion that God assumed a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body? You yourselves ascribe such excellence to the intellectual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is, after all, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that you maintain that it can become consubstantial with that intelligence of the Father whom you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. What incredible thing is it, then, if some one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be assumed by Him in an ineffable and unique manner for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of many? Moreover, our nature itself testifies that a man is incomplete unless a body be united with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This certainly would be more incredible, were it not of all things the most common; for we should more easily <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a union between spirit and spirit, or, to use your own terminology, between the incorporeal and the incorporeal, even though the one were <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, the other divine, the one changeable and the other unchangeable, than in a union between the corporeal and the incorporeal. But perhaps it is the unprecedented birth of a body from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> that staggers you? But, so far from this being a difficulty, it ought rather to assist you to receive our religion, that a miraculous person was born miraculously. Or, do you find a difficulty in the fact that, after His body had been given up to death, and had been changed into a higher kind of body by resurrection, and was now no longer mortal but incorruptible, He carried it up into heavenly places? Perhaps you refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this, because you remember that Porphyry, in these very books from which I have cited so much, and which treat of the return of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so frequently teaches that a body of every kind is to be escaped from, in order that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may dwell in blessedness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But here, in place of following Porphyry, you ought rather to have corrected him, especially since you agree with him in believing such incredible things about the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of this visible world and huge material  frame. For, as scholars of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, you hold that the world is an animal, and a very <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> animal, which you wish to be also everlasting. How, then, is it never to be loosed from a body, and yet never lose its <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, if, in order to the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the body must be left behind? The sun, too, and the other stars, you not only acknowledge to be bodies, in which you have the cordial assent of all seeing men, but also, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to what you reckon a profounder insight, you declare that they are very blessed animals, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, together with their bodies. Why is it, then, that when the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is pressed upon you, you forget, or pretend to ignore, what you <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> discuss or teach? Why is it that you refuse to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, on the ground that you hold opinions which, in fact, you yourselves demolish? Is it not because Christ came in lowliness, and you are <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>? The precise nature of the resurrection bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> may sometimes occasion discussion among those who are best read in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Scriptures; yet there is not among us the smallest <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that they shall be everlasting, and of a nature exemplified in the instance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> risen body. But whatever be their nature, since we maintain that they shall be absolutely incorruptible and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and shall offer no hindrance to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, by which it is fixed in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and as you say that among the celestials the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> blessed are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, why do you maintain that, in order to blessedness, every body must be escaped from? Why do you thus seek such a plausible reason for escaping from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if not because, as I again say, Christ is <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and you <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>? Are you ashamed to be corrected? This is the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>. It is, forsooth, a degradation for learned men to pass from the school of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> to the discipleship of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who by His Spirit taught a fisherman to think and to say, <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All things were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120432"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1-5</a></span> The old saint Simplicianus, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Milan, used to tell me that a certain <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> was in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of saying that this opening passage of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> gospel, entitled, According to John, should be written in letters of gold, and hung up in all churches in the most conspicuous place. But the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> scorn to take God for their Master, because <q>the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a> and dwelt among us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120433"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> So that, with these miserable creatures, it is not enough that they are sick, but they boast of their sickness, and are ashamed of the medicine which could heal them. And, doing so, they secure not elevation, but a more disastrous fall.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30.&mdash; Porphyry's Emendations and Modifications of Platonism.</h2>

<p>If it is considered unseemly to emend anything which <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> has touched, why did Porphyry himself make emendations, and these not a few? For it is very certain that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> wrote that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men return after death to the bodies of beasts.  Plotinus also, Porphyry's teacher, held this opinion;  yet Porphyry <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> rejected it. He was of opinion that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> return indeed into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies, but not into the bodies they had left, but other new bodies. He shrank from the other opinion, lest a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who had returned into a mule might possibly carry her own son on her back. He did not shrink, however, from a theory which admitted the possibility of a mother coming back into a girl and marrying her own son. How much more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> a creed is that which was taught by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and truthful <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, uttered by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who were moved by God's Spirit, preached by Him who was foretold as the coming Saviour by His forerunning heralds, and by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> whom He sent forth, and who filled the whole world with the gospel,&mdash; how much more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a>, I say, is the belief that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> return once for all to their own bodies, than that they return again and again to various bodies? Nevertheless Porphyry, as I have said, did considerably improve upon this opinion, in so far, at least, as he maintained that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> could transmigrate only into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies, and made no scruple about demolishing the bestial prisons into which <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> had wished to cast them. He says, too, that God put the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into the world that it might recognize the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of matter, and return to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and be for ever emancipated from the polluting contact of matter. And although here is some inappropriate thinking (for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is rather given to the body that it may do good; for it would not learn <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> unless it did it), yet he corrects the opinion of other Platonists, and that on a point of no small importance, inasmuch as he avows that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is purged from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and received to the Father's presence,  shall never again suffer the ills of this life. By this opinion he quite subverted the favorite <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> dogma, that as dead men are made out of living ones, so living men are made out of dead ones; and he exploded the idea which Virgil seems to have adopted from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, that the purified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which have been sent into the Elysian fields (the poetic name for the joys of the blessed) are summoned to the river Lethe, that is, to the oblivion of the past,</p>

<blockquote><p>That earthward they may pass once more,<br>
Remembering not the things before,<br>
And with a blind propension yearn<br>
To fleshly bodies to return. </p></blockquote>

<p>This found no favor with Porphyry, and very <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>; for it is indeed foolish to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> should desire to return from that life, which cannot be very blessed unless by the assurance of its permanence, and to come back into this life, and to the pollution of corruptible bodies, as if the result of perfect purification were only to make defilement desirable. For if perfect purification effects the oblivion of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and the oblivion of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> creates a desire for a body in which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may again be entangled with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, then the supreme felicity will be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of infelicity, and the perfection of wisdom the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of foolishness, and the purest cleansing the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of defilement. And, however long the blessedness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> last, it cannot be founded on <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, if, in order to be blessed, it must be deceived. For it cannot be blessed unless it be free from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. But, to be free from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, it must be under the false impression that it shall be always blessed,&mdash; the <em>false</em> impression, for it is destined to be also at some time miserable. &nbsp;How, then, shall the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is founded on <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>? Porphyry saw this, and therefore said that the purified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> returns to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that it may never more be entangled in the polluting contact with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The opinion, therefore, of some Platonists, that there is a necessary revolution carrying <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> away and bringing them round again to the same things, is false. But, were it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, what were the advantage of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it? Would the Platonists presume to allege their superiority to us, because we were in this life <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what they themselves were doomed to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of when perfected in purity and wisdom in another and better life, and which they must be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of if they are to be blessed? If it were most absurd and foolish to say so, then certainly we must prefer Porphyry's opinion to the idea of a circulation of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> through constantly alternating <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and misery. And if this is just, here is a <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> emending <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, here is a man who saw what <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> did not see, and who did not shrink from correcting so illustrious a master, but preferred <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31.&mdash; Against the Arguments on Which the Platonists Ground Their Assertion that the Human Soul is Co-Eternal with God.</h2>

<p>Why, then, do we not rather <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the divinity in those matters, which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> talent cannot fathom? Why do we not credit the assertion of divinity, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not co-eternal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but is created, and once was not? For the Platonists seemed to themselves to allege an adequate reason for their rejection of this doctrine, when they affirmed that nothing could be everlasting which had not always <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, however, in writing concerning the world and the gods in it, whom the Supreme made, most expressly states that they had a beginning and yet would have no end, but, by the sovereign will of the Creator, would endure <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>. But, by way of interpreting this, the Platonists have discovered that he meant a beginning, not of time, but of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. <q>For as if a foot,</q> they say, <q>had been always from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in dust, there would always have been a print underneath it; and yet no one would <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this print was made by the pressure of the foot, nor that, though the one was made by the other, neither was prior to the other; so,</q> they say, <q>the world and the gods created in it have always been, their Creator always existing, and yet they were made.</q> If, then, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has always <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, are we to say that its wretchedness has always <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>? For if there is something in it which was not from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, but began in time, why is it impossible that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, though not previously existing, should begin to be in time? Its blessedness, too, which, as he owns, is to be more stable, and indeed endless, after the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> experience of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>&mdash;this undoubtedly has a beginning in time, and yet is to be always, though previously it had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. This whole argumentation, therefore, to establish that nothing can be endless except that which has had no beginning, falls to the ground. For here we find the blessedness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which has a beginning, and yet has no end. &nbsp;And, therefore, let the incapacity of man give place to the authority of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and let us take our belief regarding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion from the ever-blessed spirits, who do not seek for themselves that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be due  to their God and ours, and who do not command us to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> save only to Him, whose <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, as I have often said already, and must often say again, we and they ought together to be, offered through that Priest who offered Himself to death a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for us, in that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which He assumed, and according to which He desired to be our Priest.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32.&mdash; Of the Universal Way of the Soul's Deliverance, Which Porphyry Did Not Find Because He Did Not Rightly Seek It, and Which the Grace of Christ Has Alone Thrown Open.</h2>

<p>This is the religion which possesses the universal way for delivering the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for except by this way, none can be delivered. This is a kind of royal way, which alone leads to a kingdom which does not totter like all temporal dignities, but stands firm on <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> foundations. And when Porphyry says, towards the end of the first book <em>De Regressu Anim&oelig;</em>, that no system of doctrine which furnishes the universal way for delivering the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has as yet been received, either from the truest <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, or from the ideas and practices of the Indians, or from the reasoning  of the Chald&aelig;ans, or from any source whatever, and that no historical reading had made him acquainted with that way, he manifestly acknowledges that there is such a way, but that as yet he was not acquainted with it. Nothing of all that he had so laboriously learned concerning the deliverance of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, nothing of all that he seemed to others, if not to himself, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, satisfied him. For he perceived that there was still wanting a commanding authority which it might be right to follow in a matter of such importance. And when he says that he had not learned from any truest <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> a system which possessed the universal way of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> deliverance, he shows plainly enough, as it seems to me, either that the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of which he was a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> was not the truest, or that it did not comprehend such a way. And how can that be the truest <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which does not possess this way? For what else is the universal way of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> deliverance than that by which all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> universally are delivered, and without which, therefore, no <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is delivered? And when he says, in addition, <q>or from the ideas and practices of the Indians, or from the reasoning of the Chald&aelig;ans, or from any source whatever,</q> he declares in the most unequivocal language that this universal way of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> deliverance was not embraced in what he had learned either from the Indians or the Chald&aelig;ans; and yet he could not forbear stating that it was from the Chald&aelig;ans he had derived these divine oracles of which he makes such frequent mention. What, therefore, does he mean by this universal way of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> deliverance, which had not yet been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by any truest <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, or by the doctrinal systems of those nations which were considered to have great insight in things divine, because they indulged more freely in a curious and fanciful science and worship of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>? What is this universal way of which he acknowledges his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, if not a way which does not belong to one nation as its special property, but is common to all, and divinely bestowed? Porphyry, a man of no mediocre abilities, does not question that such a way exists; for he believes that <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> could not have left men destitute of this universal way of delivering the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For he does not say that this way does not exist, but that this great boon and assistance has not yet been discovered, and has not come to his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And no wonder; for Porphyry lived in an age when this universal way of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> deliverance&mdash;in other words, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>&mdash;was exposed to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> of idolaters and demon-worshippers, and earthly rulers,  that the number of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> or witnesses for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> might be completed and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and that by them <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> might be given that we must endure all bodily sufferings in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and for the commendation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Porphyry, being a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of these <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, concluded that this way was destined to a speedy extinction, and that it, therefore, was not the universal way of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> deliverance, and did not see that the very thing that thus moved him, and deterred him from becoming a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, contributed to the confirmation and more effectual commendation of our religion.</p>

<p>This, then, is the universal way of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> deliverance, the way that is granted by the divine compassion to the nations universally. And no nation to which the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it has already come, or may hereafter come, ought to demand, Why so soon? Or, Why so late?&mdash; for the design of Him who sends it is impenetrable by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> capacity. This was felt by Porphyry when he confined himself to saying that this gift of God was not yet received, and had not yet come to his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For though this was so, he did not on that account pronounce that the way it  self had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. This, I say, is the universal way for the deliverance of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, concerning which the faithful <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> received the divine assurance, <q>In your seed shall all nations be blessed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120439"><a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse18">Genesis&nbsp;22:18</a></span> He, indeed, was by birth a Chald&aelig;an; but, that he might receive these great promises, and that there might be propagated from him a seed <q>disposed by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the hand of a Mediator,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120440"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse19">Galatians&nbsp;3:19</a></span> in whom this universal way, thrown open to all nations for the deliverance of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, might be found, he was ordered to leave his country, and kindred, and father's house. Then was he himself, first of all, delivered from the Chald&aelig;an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a>, and by his <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> worshipped the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose promises he faithfully trusted. This is the universal way, of which it is said in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be merciful unto us, and bless us, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> His face to shine upon us; that Your way may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> upon earth, Your saving health among all nations.</q>  And hence, when our Saviour, so long after, had taken flesh of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, He says of Himself, <q>I am the way, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120442"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> This is the universal way, of which so long before it had been predicted, <q>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths: for out of Sion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120443"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;2:2-3</a></span> This way, therefore, is not the property of one, but of all nations. The law and the word of the Lord did not remain in Zion and Jerusalem, but issued thence to be universally diffused. And therefore the Mediator Himself, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, says to His alarmed <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>These are the words which I spoke unto you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, concerning me. Then opened He their understandings that they might understand the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120444"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse44">Luke&nbsp;24:44-47</a></span> This is the universal way of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> deliverance, which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> formerly disclosed where they could among the few men who found the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and especially in the Hebrew nation, whose commonwealth was, as it were, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to prefigure and fore-announce the city of God which was to be gathered from all nations, by their tabernacle, and temple, and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. In some explicit statements, and in many obscure foreshadowings, this way was declared; but latterly came the Mediator Himself in the flesh, and His blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, revealing how the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> more openly explained what had been obscurely hinted to preceding generations, in conformity with the relation of the ages of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and as it pleased God in His wisdom to appoint, who also bore them <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> with signs and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> some of which I have cited above. For not only were there visions of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and words heard from those heavenly ministrants, but also men of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, armed with the word of simple <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, cast out unclean spirits from the bodies and senses of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and healed deformities and sicknesses; the wild beasts of earth and sea, the birds of air, inanimate things, the elements, the stars, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> their divine commands; the powers of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> gave way before them, the dead were restored to life. I say nothing of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> peculiar and proper to the Saviour's own person, especially the nativity and the resurrection; in the one of which He wrought only the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> maternity, while in the other He furnished an instance of the resurrection which all shall at last experience. This way purifies the whole man, and prepares the mortal in all his parts for <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. For, to prevent us from seeking for one purgation for the part which Porphyry calls intellectual, and another for the part he calls spiritual, and another for the body itself, our most mighty and truthful Purifier and Saviour assumed the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Except by this way, which has been present among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> both during the period of the promises and of the proclamation of their fulfillment, no man has been delivered, no man is delivered, no man shall be delivered.</p>

<p>As to Porphyry's statement that the universal way of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> deliverance had not yet come to his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by any acquaintance he had with history, I would ask, what more remarkable history can be found than that which has taken possession of the whole world by its authoritative voice? Or what more trustworthy than that which narrates past events, and predicts the future with  equal clearness, and in the unfulfilled predictions of which we are constrained to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> by those that are already fulfilled? For neither Porphyry nor any Platonists can despise <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> and prediction, even of things that pertain to this life and earthly matters, though they <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> despise ordinary soothsaying and the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> that is connected with magical arts. They deny that these are the predictions of great men, or are to be considered important, and they are right; for they are founded, either on the foresight of subsidiary causes, as to a professional eye much of the course of a disease is foreseen by certain pre-monitory symptoms, or the unclean <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> predict what they have resolved to do, that they may thus work upon the thoughts and desires of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> with an appearance of authority, and incline <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty to imitate their impure actions. It is not such things that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who walk in the universal way care to predict as important, although, for the purpose of commending the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> and often predicted even such things as could not be detected by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> observation, nor be readily verified by experience. But there were other <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> important and divine events which they predicted, in so far as it was given them to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and all those important marvels that were accomplished in Him, and done in His name; the repentance of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and the conversion of their wills to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of righteousness, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and the multitudes in all parts of the world who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> divinity; the overthrow of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> worship, and the testing of the faithful by trials; the purification of those who persevered, and their deliverance from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; the day of judgment, the resurrection of the dead, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> damnation of the community of the ungodly, and the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> kingdom of the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ever-<a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the enjoyment of the vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;these things were predicted and promised in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of this way; and of these we see so many fulfilled, that we <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> and piously trust that the rest will also come to pass. As for those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and consequently do not understand, that this is the way which leads straight to the vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> fellowship with Him, according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> predictions and statements of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, they may storm at our position, but they cannot storm it.</p>

<p>And therefore, in these ten books, though not meeting, I dare say, the expectation of some, yet I have, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and Lord has vouchsafed to aid me, satisfied the desire of certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, by refuting the objections of the ungodly, who prefer their own gods to the Founder of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city, about which we undertook to speak. Of these ten books, the first five were directed against those who think we should worship the gods for the sake of the blessings of this life, and the second five against those who think we should worship them for the sake of the life which is to be after death. And now, in fulfillment of the promise I made in the first book, I shall go on to say, as God shall aid me, what I think needs to be said regarding the origin, history, and deserved ends of the two cities, which, as already remarked, are in this world commingled and implicated with one another.</p>
