<h1>The City of God (Book XI)</h1>

<p class="h1a">Here begins the second part of this work, which treats of the origin, history, and destinies of the two cities, the earthly and the heavenly. In the first place, Augustine shows in this book how the two cities were formed originally, by the separation of the good and bad angels; and takes occasion to treat of the creation of the world, as it is described in Holy Scripture in the beginning of the book of Genesis.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; Of This Part of the Work, Wherein We Begin to Explain the Origin and End of the Two Cities.</h2>

<p>The city of God we speak of is the same to which testimony is borne by that Scripture, which excels all the writings of all nations by its divine authority, and has brought under its influence all kinds of minds, and this not by a casual intellectual movement, but obviously by an express <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> arrangement. For there it is written, <q>Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  And in another psalm we read, <q>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the mountain of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, increasing the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the whole earth.</q>  And, a little after, in the same psalm, <q>As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God. God has established it for ever.</q> And in another, <q>There is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place of the tabernacles of the Most High. God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved.</q>  From these and similar testimonies, all of which it were tedious to cite, we have learned that there is a city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and its Founder has inspired us with a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which makes us <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> its citizenship. To this Founder of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city the citizens of the earthly city prefer their own gods, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that He is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of gods, not of false, <em>i.e</em>., of impious and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> gods, who, being deprived of His unchangeable and freely communicated light, and so reduced to a kind of poverty-stricken power, eagerly grasp at their own private privileges, and seek divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> from their deluded subjects; but of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> gods, who are better pleased to submit themselves to one, than to subject many to themselves, and who would rather worship God than be worshipped as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But to the enemies of this city we have replied in the ten preceding books, according to our ability and the help afforded by our Lord and King. Now, recognizing what is expected of me, and not unmindful of my promise, and relying, too, on the same succor, I will endeavor to treat of the origin, and progress, and deserved destinies of the two cities (the earthly and the heavenly, to wit), which, as we said, are in this present world commingled, and as it were entangled together. And, first, I will explain how the foundations of these two cities were originally laid, in the difference that arose among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; Of the Knowledge of God, to Which No Man Can Attain Save Through the Mediator Between God and Men, the Man Christ Jesus.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;It is a great and very rare thing for a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,  after he has contemplated the whole creation, corporeal and incorporeal, and has discerned its mutability, to pass beyond it, and, by the continued soaring of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to attain to the unchangeable substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, in that height of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, to learn from God Himself that none but He has made all that is not of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. For God speaks with a man not by means of some audible creature dinning in his ears, so that atmospheric vibrations connect Him that makes with him that hears the sound, nor even by means of a spiritual being with the semblance of a body, such as we see in dreams or similar states; for even in this case He speaks as if to the ears of the body, because it is by means of the semblance of a body He speaks, and with the appearance of a real interval of space&mdash;for visions are exact representations of bodily objects. Not by these, then, does God speak, but by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, if any one is prepared to hear with the mind rather than with the body. For He speaks to that part of man which is better than all else that is in him, and than which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself alone is better. For since man is most properly understood (or, if that cannot be, then, at least, <em><a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a></em>) to be made in God's image, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it is that part of him by which he rises above those lower parts he has in common with the beasts, which brings him nearer to the Supreme. But since the mind itself, though naturally capable of reason and intelligence is disabled by besotting and inveterate <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> not merely from delighting and abiding in, but even from tolerating His unchangeable light, until it has been gradually healed, and renewed, and made capable of such felicity, it had, in the first place, to be impregnated with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and so purified. And that in this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it might advance the more confidently towards the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, God's Son, assuming humanity without destroying His divinity,  established and founded this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that there might be a way for man to man's God through a God-man. For this is the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. For it is as man that He is the Mediator and the Way. Since, if the way lies between him who goes, and the place whither he goes, there is hope of his reaching it; but if there be no way, or if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not where it is, what boots it to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whither he should go? Now the only way that is infallibly secured against all mistakes, is when the very same person is at once <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, God our end, man our way. </p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; Of the Authority of the Canonical Scriptures Composed by the Divine Spirit.</h2>

<p>This Mediator, having spoken what He judged sufficient first by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, then by His own lips, and afterwards by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, has besides produced the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> which is called canonical, which has paramount authority, and to which we yield assent in all matters of which we ought not to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and yet cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of ourselves. For if we attain the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of present objects by the testimony of our own senses,  whether internal or external, then, regarding objects remote from our own senses, we need others to bring their testimony, since we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them by our own, and we credit the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom the objects have been or are sensibly present. Accordingly, as in the case of visible objects which we have not seen, we trust those who have, (and likewise with all sensible objects,) so in the case of things which are perceived  by the mind and spirit, <em> i.e</em>., which are remote from our own interior sense, it behooves us to trust those who have seen them set in that incorporeal light, or abidingly contemplate them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; That the World is Neither Without Beginning, Nor Yet Created by a New Decree of God, by Which He Afterwards Willed What He Had Not Before Willed.</h2>

<p>Of all visible things, the world is the greatest; of all invisible, the greatest is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But, that the world is, we see; that God is, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. That God made the world, we can <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> from no one more safely than from God Himself. But where have we heard Him? Nowhere more distinctly than in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, where His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said, <q>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120453"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;1:1</a></span> Was the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> present when God made the heavens and the earth? No; but the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whom all things were made, was there, <span class="stiki" id="note120454"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse27">Proverbs&nbsp;8:27</a></span> and wisdom insinuates itself into <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and makes them the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and noiselessly informs them of His works. They are taught also by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who always behold the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note120455"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;18:10</a></span> and announce His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to whom it befits. Of these <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> was he who said and wrote, <q>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</q> And so fit a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> was he  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the same <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, who revealed these things to him, enabled him also so long before to predict that our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> also would be forthcoming.</p>

<p>But why did God choose then to create the heavens and earth which up to that time He had not made?  If they who put this question wish to make out that the world is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and without beginning, and that consequently it has not been made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they are strangely deceived, and rave in the incurable <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of impiety. For, though the voices of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were silent, the world itself, by its well-ordered changes and movements, and by the fair appearance of all visible things, bears a testimony of its own, both that it has been created, and also that it could not have been created save by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose greatness and beauty are unutterable and invisible. As for those  who own, indeed, that it was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and yet ascribe to it not a temporal but only a creational beginning, so that in some scarcely intelligible way the world should always have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> a created world they make an assertion which seems to them to defend God from the charge of arbitrary hastiness, or of suddenly conceiving the idea of creating the world as a quite new idea, or of casually changing His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, though He be unchangeable. But I do not see how this supposition of theirs can stand in other respects, and chiefly in respect of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for if they contend that it is co-eternal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they will be quite at a loss to explain whence there has accrued to it new misery, which through a previous <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> had not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. For if they said that its <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and misery ceaselessly alternate, they must say, further, that this alternation will continue for ever; whence will result this absurdity, that, though the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is called blessed, it is not so in this, that it foresees its own misery and disgrace. And yet, if it does not foresee it, and supposes that it will be neither disgraced nor wretched, but always blessed, then it is blessed because it is deceived; and a more foolish statement one cannot make. But if their idea is that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> misery has alternated with its bliss during the ages of the past <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, but that now, when once the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been set free, it will return henceforth no more to misery, they are nevertheless of opinion that it has never been <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> blessed before, but begins at last to enjoy a new and uncertain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; that is to say, they must acknowledge that some new thing, and that an important and signal thing, happens to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which never in a whole past <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> happened it before. And if they deny that God's <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> purpose included this new experience of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, they deny that He is the Author of its blessedness, which is unspeakable impiety. If, on the other hand, they say that the future blessedness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the result of a new decree of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how will they show that God is not chargeable with that mutability which displeases them? Further, if they acknowledge that it was created in time, but will never perish in time,&mdash; that it has, like number,  a beginning but no end&mdash;and that, therefore, having once made trial of misery, and been delivered from it, it will never again return thereto, they will certainly admit that this takes place without any violation of the immutable counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Let them, then, in like manner <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> regarding the world that it too could be made in time, and yet that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in making it, did not alter His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> design.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; That We Ought Not to Seek to Comprehend the Infinite Ages of Time Before the World, Nor the Infinite Realms of Space.</h2>

<p>Next, we must see what reply can be made to those who agree that God is the Creator of the world, but have difficulties about the time of its creation, and what reply, also, they can make to difficulties we might raise about the place of its creation. For, as they demand why the world was created then and no sooner, we may ask why it was created just here where it is, and not elsewhere. For if they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> spaces of time before the world, during which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could not have been idle, in like manner they may conceive outside the world <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> realms of space, in which, if any one says that the Omnipotent cannot hold His hand from working, will it not follow that they must adopt <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus'</a> dream of innumerable worlds? With this difference only, that he asserts that they are formed and destroyed by the fortuitous movements of atoms, while they will hold that they are made by God's hand, if they maintain that, throughout the boundless immensity of space, stretching interminably in every direction round the world, God cannot rest, and that the worlds which they suppose Him to make cannot be destroyed. For here the question is with those who, with ourselves, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God is spiritual, and the Creator of all existences but Himself. As for others, it is a condescension to dispute with them on a religious question,  for they have acquired a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> only among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who pay divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> to a number of gods, and have become conspicuous among the other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> for no other reason than that, though they are still far from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they are near it in comparison with the rest. While these, then, neither confine in any place, nor limit, nor distribute the divine substance, but, as is worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, own it to be wholly though spiritually present everywhere, will they perchance say that this substance is absent from such immense spaces outside the world, and is occupied in one only, (and that a very little one compared with the infinity beyond), the one, namely, in which is the world? I think they will not proceed to this absurdity. Since they maintain that there is but one world, of vast material bulk, indeed, yet finite, and in its own determinate position, and that this was made by the working of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let them give the same account of God's resting in the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> times before the world as they give of His resting in the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> spaces outside of it. And as it does not follow that God set the world in the very spot it occupies and no other by accident rather than by divine reason, although no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reason can comprehend why it was so set, and though there was no merit in the spot chosen to give it the precedence of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> others, so neither does it follow that we should suppose that God was guided by chance when He created the world in that and no earlier time, although previous times had been running by during an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> past, and though there was no difference by which one time could be chosen in preference to another. But if they say that the thoughts of men are idle when they conceive <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> places, since there is no place beside the world, we reply that, by the same showing, it is vain to conceive of the past times of God's rest, since there is no time before the world.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; That the World and Time Had Both One Beginning, and the One Did Not Anticipate the Other.</h2>

<p>For if <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and time are rightly distinguished by this, that time does not exist without some movement and transition, while in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> there is no change, who does not see that there could have been no time had not some creature been made, which by some motion could give birth to change&mdash;the various parts of which motion and change, as they cannot be simultaneous, succeed one another&mdash;and thus, in these shorter or longer intervals of duration, time would begin? Since then, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whose <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is no change at all, is the Creator and Ordainer of time, I do not see how He can be said to have created the world after spaces of time had elapsed, unless it be said that prior to the world there was some creature by whose movement time could pass. And if the sacred and infallible Scriptures say that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, in order that it may be understood that He had made nothing previously&mdash;for if He had made anything before the rest, this thing would rather be said to have been made <q>in the beginning,</q>&mdash; then assuredly the world was made, not in time, but simultaneously with time. &nbsp;For that which is made in time is made both after and before some time,&mdash; after that which is past, before that which is future. But none could then be past, for there was no creature by whose movements its duration could be measured. But simultaneously with time the world was made, if in the world's creation change and motion were created, as seems evident from the order of the first six or seven days. For in these days the morning and evening are counted, until, on the sixth day, all things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> then made were finished, and on the seventh the rest of God was mysteriously and sublimely signalized. What kind of days these were it is extremely difficult, or perhaps impossible for us to conceive, and how much more to say!</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; Of the Nature of the First Days, Which are Said to Have Had Morning and Evening, Before There Was a Sun.</h2>

<p>We see, indeed, that our ordinary days have no evening but by the setting, and no morning but by the rising, of the sun; but the first three days of all were passed without sun, since it is reported to have been made on the fourth day. And first of all, indeed, light was made by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we read, separated it from the darkness, and called the light Day, and the darkness Night; but what kind of light that was, and by what periodic movement it made evening and morning, is beyond the reach of our senses; neither can we understand how it was, and yet must unhesitatingly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it. For either it was some material light, whether proceeding from the upper parts of the world, far removed from our sight, or from the spot where the sun was afterwards kindled; or under the name of light the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city was signified, composed of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and blessed spirits, the city of which the apostle says, <q>Jerusalem which is above is our <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>  mother in heaven;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120459"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse26">Galatians&nbsp;4:26</a></span> and in another place, <q>For you are all the children of the light, and the children of the day; we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120460"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:5</a></span> Yet in some respects we may appropriately speak of a morning and evening of this day also. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the creature is, in comparison of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Creator, but a twilight; and so it dawns and breaks into morning when the creature is drawn to the praise and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Creator; and night never falls when the Creator is not forsaken through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the creature. In fine, Scripture, when it would recount those days in order, never mentions the word night. It never says, <q>Night was,</q> but <q>The evening and the morning were the first day.</q> So of the second and the rest. And, indeed, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things contemplated by themselves is, so to speak, more colorless than when they are seen in the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as in the art by which they were made. Therefore evening is a more suitable figure than night; and yet, as I said, morning returns when the creature returns to the praise and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Creator. When it does so in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of itself, that is the first day; when in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the firmament, which is the name given to the sky between the waters above and those beneath, that is the second day; when in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the earth, and the sea, and all things that grow out of the earth, that is the third day; when in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the greater and less luminaries, and all the stars, that is the fourth day; when in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all animals that swim in the waters and that fly in the air, that is the fifth day; when in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all animals that live on the earth, and of man himself, that is the sixth day. </p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; What We are to Understand of God's Resting on the Seventh Day, After the Six Days' Work.</h2>

<p>When it is said that God rested on the seventh day from all His works, and hallowed it, we are not to conceive of this in a childish fashion, as if work were a toil to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <q>spoke and it was done,</q>&mdash; spoke by the spiritual and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, not audible and transitory word. But God's rest signifies the rest of those who rest in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of a house means the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of those in the house who <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, though not the house, but something else, causes the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. How much more intelligible is such phraseology, then, if the house itself, by its own beauty, makes the inhabitants joyful! For in this case we not only call it joyful by that figure of speech in which the thing containing is used for the thing contained (as when we say, <q>The theatres applaud,</q> <q>The meadows low,</q> meaning that the men in the one applaud, and the oxen in the other low), but also by that figure in which the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is spoken of as if it were the effect, as when a letter is said to be joyful, because it makes its readers so. Most appropriately, therefore, the sacred narrative states that God rested, meaning thereby that those rest who are in Him, and whom He makes to rest. And this the prophetic narrative promises also to the men to whom it speaks, and for whom it was written, that they themselves, after those good works which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does in and by them, if they have managed by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to get near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this life, shall enjoy in Him <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rest. This was pre-figured to the ancient people of God by the rest enjoined in their <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> law, of which, in its own place, I shall speak more at large.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; What the Scriptures Teach Us to Believe Concerning the Creation of the Angels.</h2>

<p>At present, since I have undertaken to treat of the origin of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city, and first of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who constitute a large part of this city, and indeed the more blessed part, since they have never been expatriated, I will give myself to the task of explaining, by God's help, and as far as seems suitable, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which relate to this point. Where Scripture speaks of the world's creation, it is not plainly said whether or when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were created; but if mention of them is made, it is implicitly under the name of <q>heaven,</q> when it is said, <q>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,</q> or perhaps rather under the name of <q>light,</q> of which presently. But that they were wholly omitted, I am unable to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, because it is written that God on the seventh day rested from all His works which He made; and this very book itself begins, <q>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,</q> so that before heaven and earth God seems to have made nothing. Since, therefore, He began with the heavens and the earth&mdash;and the earth itself, as Scripture adds, was at first invisible and formless, light not being as yet made, and darkness covering the face of the deep (that is to say, covering an undefined chaos of earth and sea, for where light is not, darkness must needs be)&mdash;and then when all things, which are recorded to have been completed in six days, were created and arranged,  how should the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> be omitted, as if they were not among the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from which on the seventh day He rested? Yet, though the fact that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are the work of God is not omitted here, it is indeed not explicitly mentioned; but elsewhere <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> asserts it in the clearest manner. For in the Hymn of the Three Children in the Furnace it was said, <q>O all you works of the Lord bless the Lord;</q>  and among these works mentioned afterwards in detail, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are named. And in the psalm it is said, <q>Praise the Lord from the heavens, praise Him in the heights. Praise Him, all His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; praise Him, all His hosts. Praise Him, sun and moon; praise him, all you stars of light. Praise Him, you heaven of heavens; and you waters that be above the heavens. Let them praise the name of the Lord; for He commanded, and they were created.</q>  Here the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are most expressly and by divine authority said to have been made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for of them among the other heavenly things it is said, <q>He commanded, and they were created.</q> Who, then, will be bold enough to suggest that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were made after the six days' creation? If any one is so foolish, his folly is disposed of by a scripture of like authority, where God says, <q>When the stars were made, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> praised me with a loud voice.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120464"><a href="../bible/job038.htm#verse7">Job&nbsp;38:7</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> therefore <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the stars; and the stars were made the fourth day. Shall we then say that they were made the third day? Far from it; for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what was made that day. The earth was separated from the water, and each element took its own distinct form, and the earth produced all that grows on it. On the second day, then? Not even on this; for on it the firmament was made between the waters above and beneath, and was called <q><a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>,</q> in which firmament the stars were made on the fourth day. There is no question, then, that if the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are included in the works of God during these six days, they are that light which was called <q>Day,</q> and whose unity Scripture signalizes by calling that day not the <q>first day,</q> but <q>one day.</q>  For the second day, the third, and the rest are not other days; but the same <q>one</q> day is repeated to complete the number six or seven, so that there should be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> both of God's works and of His rest. For when God said, <q>Let there be light, and there was light,</q> if we are justified in understanding in this light the creation of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, then certainly they were created partakers of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light which is the unchangeable Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which all things were made, and whom we call the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; so that they, being illumined by the Light that created them, might themselves become light and be called <q>Day,</q> in participation of that unchangeable Light and Day which is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, by whom both themselves and all else were made. <q>The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light, which lights every man that comes into the world,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120466"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;1:9</a></span> &mdash; this Light lights also every pure <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, that he may be light not in himself, but in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; from whom if an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> turn away, he becomes impure, as are all those who are called unclean spirits, and are no longer light in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, but darkness in themselves, being deprived of the participation of Light <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. For <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has no positive nature; but the loss of good has received the name <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; Of the Simple and Unchangeable Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, One God, in Whom Substance and Quality are Identical.</h2>

<p>There is, accordingly, a good which is alone simple, and therefore alone unchangeable, and this is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. By this Good have all others been created, but not simple, and therefore not unchangeable. <q>Created,</q> I say&mdash;that is, made, not begotten. For that which is begotten of the simple Good is simple as itself, and the same as itself. These two we call the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>; and both together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and to this Spirit the epithet Holy is in Scripture, as it were, appropriated. And He is another than the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, for He is neither the Father nor the Son. I say <q>another,</q> not <q>another thing,</q> because He is equally with them the simple Good, unchangeable and co-eternal. And this Trinity is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>; and none the less simple because a Trinity. For we do not say that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the good is simple, because the Father alone possesses it, or the Son alone, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> alone; nor do we say, with the Sabellian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, that it is only nominally a Trinity, and has no real distinction of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; but we say it is simple, because it is what it has, with the exception of the relation of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to one another. For, in regard to this relation, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the Father has a Son, and yet is not Himself the Son; and the Son has a Father, and is not Himself the Father. But, as regards Himself, irrespective of relation to  the other, each is what He has; thus, He is in Himself living, for He has life, and is Himself the Life which He has.</p>

<p>It is for this reason, then, that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Trinity is called simple, because it has not anything which it can lose, and because it is not one thing and its contents another, as a cup and the liquor, or a body and its color, or the air and the light or heat of it, or a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and its wisdom. For none of these is what it has: the cup is not liquor, nor the body color, nor the air light and heat, nor the mind wisdom. And hence they can be deprived of what they have, and can be turned or changed into other qualities and states, so that the cup may be emptied of the liquid of which it is full, the body be discolored, the air darken, the mind grow silly. The incorruptible body which is promised to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the resurrection cannot, indeed, lose its quality of incorruption, but the bodily substance and the quality of incorruption are not the same thing. For the quality of incorruption resides entire in each several part, not greater in one and less in another; for no part is more incorruptible than another. The body, indeed, is itself greater in whole than in part; and one part of it is larger, another smaller, yet is not the larger more incorruptible than the smaller. The body, then, which is not in each of its parts a whole body, is one thing; incorruptibility, which is throughout complete, is another thing&mdash;for every part of the incorruptible body, however unequal to the rest otherwise, is equally incorrupt. For the hand, <em> e.g</em>., is not more incorrupt than the finger because it is larger than the finger; so, though finger and hand are unequal, their incorruptibility is equal. Thus, although incorruptibility is inseparable from an incorruptible body, yet the substance of the body is one thing, the quality of incorruption another. And therefore the body is not what it has. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, too, though it be always wise (as it will be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> when it is redeemed), will be so by participating in the unchangeable wisdom, which it is not; for though the air be never <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> of the light that is shed abroad in it, it is not on that account the same thing as the light. I do not mean that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is air, as has been supposed by some who could not conceive a spiritual nature;  but, with much dissimilarity, the two things have a kind of likeness, which makes it suitable to say that the immaterial <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is illumined with the immaterial light of the simple wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the material air is irradiated with material light, and that, as the air, when deprived of this light, grows dark, (for material darkness is nothing else than air wanting light, ) so the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, deprived of the light of wisdom, grows dark.</p>

<p>According to this, then, those things which are essentially and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine are called simple, because in them quality and substance are identical, and because they are divine, or wise, or <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in themselves, and without extraneous supplement. In <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the Spirit of wisdom is called <q>manifold</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120470"><a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse22">Wisdom&nbsp;7:22</a></span> because it contains many things in it; but what it contains it also is, and it being one is all these things. For neither are there many wisdoms, but one, in which are untold and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> treasures of things intellectual, wherein are all invisible and unchangeable reasons of things visible and changeable which were created by it.  For God made nothing unwittingly; not even a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> workman can be said to do so. But if He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all that He made, He made only those things which He had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Whence flows a very striking but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conclusion, that this world could not be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us unless it <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, but could not have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> unless it had been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; Whether the Angels that Fell Partook of the Blessedness Which the Holy Angels Have Always Enjoyed from the Time of Their Creation.</h2>

<p>And since these things are so, those spirits whom we call <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were never at any time or in any way darkness, but, as soon as they were made, were made light; yet they were not so created in order that they might exist and live in any way whatever, but were enlightened that they might live wisely and blessedly. Some of them, having turned away from this light, have not won this wise and blessed life, which is certainly <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and accompanied with the sure confidence of its <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; but they have still the life of reason, though darkened with folly, and this they cannot lose even if they would. But who can determine to what extent they were partakers of that wisdom before they fell? And how shall we say that they participated in it equally with those who through it are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and fully blessed, resting in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> certainty of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> felicity? For if they had  equally participated in this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, then the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> would have remained <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> blessed equally with the good, because they were equally expectant of it. For, though a life be never so long, it cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> called <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> if it is destined to have an end; for it is called life inasmuch as it is lived, but <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> because it has no end. Wherefore, although everything <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> is not therefore blessed (for <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell-fire</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>), yet if no life can be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and perfectly blessed except it be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, the life of these <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> was not blessed, for it was doomed to end, and therefore not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, whether they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it or not. In the one case <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, in the other <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, prevented them from being blessed. And even if their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> was not so great as to breed in them a wholly false expectation, but left them wavering in uncertainty whether their good would be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> or would some time terminate, this very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning so grand a destiny was incompatible with the plenitude of blessedness which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> enjoyed. For we do not so narrow and restrict the application of the term <q>blessedness</q> as to apply it to God only,  though doubtless He is so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> blessed that greater blessedness cannot be; and, in comparison of His blessedness, what is that of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, though, according to their capacity, they be perfectly blessed?</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; A Comparison of the Blessedness of the Righteous, Who Have Not Yet Received the Divine Reward, with that of Our First Parents in Paradise.</h2>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not the only members of the rational and intellectual creation whom we call blessed. For who will take upon him to deny that those first men in Paradise were blessed previously to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, although they were uncertain how long their blessedness was to last, and whether it would be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> (and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> it would have been had they not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>)&mdash;who, I say, will do so, seeing that even now we not unbecomingly call those blessed whom we see leading a righteous and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life, in hope of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, who have no harrowing remorse of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, but obtain readily divine remission of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of their present infirmity? These, though they are certain that they shall be rewarded if they persevere, are not certain that they will persevere. For what man can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he will persevere to the end in the exercise and increase of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, unless he has been certified by some revelation from Him who, in His just and secret judgment, while He deceives none, informs few regarding this matter? Accordingly, so far as present comfort goes, the first man in Paradise was more blessed than any just man in this insecure state; but as regards the hope of future good, every man who not merely supposes, but certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that he shall <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> enjoy the most high God in the company of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and beyond the reach of ill&mdash;this man, no matter what bodily torments afflict him, is more blessed than was he who, even in that great felicity of Paradise, was uncertain of his <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; Whether All the Angels Were So Created in One Common State of Felicity, that Those Who Fell Were Not Aware that They Would Fall, and that Those Who Stood Received Assurance of Their Own Perseverance After the Ruin of the Fallen.</h2>

<p>From all this, it will readily occur to any one that the blessedness which an intelligent being desires as its legitimate object results from a combination of these two things, namely, that it uninterruptedly enjoy the unchangeable good, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and that it be delivered from all dubiety, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> certainly that it shall <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> abide in the same enjoyment. That it is so with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of light we piously <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; but that the fallen <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who by their own default lost that light, did not enjoy this blessedness even before they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, reason bids us conclude. Yet if their life was of any duration before they fell, we must allow them a blessedness of some kind, though not that which is accompanied with foresight. Or, if it seems hard to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were created, some were created in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> either of their perseverance or their fall, while others were most certainly assured of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of their felicity&mdash;if it is hard to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they were not all from the beginning on an equal footing, until these who are now <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> did of their own will fall away from the light of goodness, certainly it is much harder to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are now uncertain of their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessedness, and do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> regarding themselves as much as we have been able to gather regarding them from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>. For what Catholic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that no new <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> will ever arise among the good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that this present <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> will never again return  into the fellowship of the good? For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the gospel promises to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> that they will be equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and it is also promised them that they will <q>go away into life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120474"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;25:46</a></span> But if we are certain that we shall never lapse from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> felicity, while they are not certain, then we shall not be their equals, but their superiors. But as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> never deceives, and as we shall be their equals, they must be certain of their blessedness. And because the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> could not be certain of that, since their blessedness was destined to come to an end, it follows either that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were unequal, or that, if equal, the good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were assured of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of their blessedness after the perdition of the others; unless, possibly, some one may say that the words of the Lord about the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <q>He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120475"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> are to be understood as if he was not only a murderer from the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, when man, whom he could kill by his deceit, was made, but also that he did not abide in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from the time of his own creation, and was accordingly never blessed with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but refused to submit to his Creator, and proudly exulted as if in a private lordship of his own, and was thus deceived and deceiving. For the dominion of the Almighty cannot be eluded; and he who will not piously submit himself to things as they are, proudly feigns, and mocks himself with a state of things that does not exist; so that what the blessed Apostle John says thus becomes intelligible: <q>The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from the beginning,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120476"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:8</a></span> &mdash; that is, from the time he was created he refused righteousness, which none but a will piously subject to God can enjoy. Whoever adopts this opinion at least disagrees with those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> the Manichees, and with any other pestilential <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> that may suppose that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has derived from some adverse <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> principle a nature proper to himself. These <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are so befooled by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, that, although they acknowledge with ourselves the authority of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a>, they do not notice that the Lord did not say, <q>The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was naturally a stranger to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> but <q>The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> abode not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> by which He meant us to understand that he had fallen from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in which, if he had abode, he would have become a partaker of it, and have remained in blessedness along with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; An Explanation of What is Said of the Devil, that He Did Not Abide in the Truth, Because the Truth Was Not in Him.</h2>

<p>Moreover, as if we had been inquiring why the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> did not abide in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, our Lord subjoins the reason, saying, <q>because the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in him.</q> Now, it would be in him had he abode in it. But the phraseology is unusual. For, as the words stand, <q>He abode not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in him,</q> it seems as if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth's</a> not being in him were the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his not abiding in it; whereas his not abiding in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is rather the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its not being in him. The same form of speech is found in the psalm: <q>I have called upon You, for You have heard me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  where we should expect it to be said, You have heard me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for I have called upon You. But when he had said, <q>I have called,</q> then, as if some one were seeking <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this, he demonstrates the effectual earnestness of his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> by the effect of God's hearing it; as if he had said, The <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> is that You have heard me.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; How We are to Understand the Words, <q>The Devil Sins from the Beginning.</q></h2>

<p>As for what John says about the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, <q>The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from the beginning</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120479"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:8</a></span> they  who suppose it is meant hereby that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was made with a sinful nature, misunderstand it; for if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be natural, it is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at all. And how do they answer the prophetic <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>&mdash;either what Isaiah says when he represents the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> under the person of the king of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, <q>How are you fallen, O Lucifer, son of the morning!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120481"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;14:12</a></span> or what Ezekiel says, <q>You have been in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a>, the garden of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; every precious stone was your covering,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120482"><a href="../bible/eze028.htm#verse13">Ezekiel&nbsp;28:13</a></span> where it is meant that he was some time without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for a little after it is still more explicitly said, <q>You were perfect in your ways?</q> And if these passages cannot well be otherwise interpreted, we must understand by this one also, <q>He abode not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> that he was once in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but did not remain in it. And from this passage, <q>The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from the beginning,</q> it is not to be supposed that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> from the beginning of his created <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but from the beginning of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when by his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> he had once commenced to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. There is a passage, too, in the Book of Job, of which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is the subject: <q>This is the beginning of the  creation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which He made to be a sport to His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q>  which agrees with the psalm, where it is said, <q>There is that dragon which You have made to be a sport therein.</q>  But these passages are not to lead us to suppose that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was originally created to be the sport of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but that he was doomed to this punishment after his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. His beginning, then, is the handiwork of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for there is no nature, even among the least, and lowest, and last of the beasts, which was not the work of Him from whom has proceeded all measure, all form, all order, without which nothing can be planned or conceived. How much more, then, is this angelic nature, which surpasses in dignity all else that He has made, the handiwork of the Most High!</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; Of the Ranks and Differences of the Creatures, Estimated by Their Utility, or According to the Natural Gradations of Being.</h2>

<p>For, among those beings which exist, and which are not of God the Creator's <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, those which have life are ranked above those which have none; those that have the power of generation, or even of desiring, above those which want this faculty. And, among things that have life, the sentient are higher than those which have no sensation, as animals are ranked above trees. And, among the sentient, the intelligent are above those that have not intelligence,&mdash; men, <em>e.g</em>., above cattle. And, among the intelligent, the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> such as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, above the mortal, such as men. These are the gradations according to the order of nature; but according to the utility each man finds in a thing, there are various standards of value, so that it comes to pass that we prefer some things that have no sensation to some sentient beings. And so strong is this preference, that, had we the power, we would abolish the latter from nature altogether, whether in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the place they hold in nature, or, though we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> them to our own convenience. Who, <em>e.g</em>., would not rather have bread in his house than mice, gold than fleas? But there is little to wonder at in this, seeing that even when valued by men themselves (whose nature is certainly of the highest dignity), more is often given for a horse than for a slave, for a jewel than for a maid. Thus the reason of one contemplating nature prompts very different judgments from those dictated by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the needy, or the desire of the voluptuous; for the former considers what value a thing in itself has in the scale of creation, while necessity considers how it meets its need; reason looks for what the mental light will judge to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, while pleasure looks for what pleasantly titilates the bodily sense. But of such consequence in rational natures is the weight, so to speak, of will and of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that though in the order of nature <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> rank above men, yet, by the scale of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, good men are of greater value than bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.&mdash; That the Flaw of Wickedness is Not Nature, But Contrary to Nature, and Has Its Origin, Not in the Creator, But in the Will.</h2>

<p>It is with reference to the nature, then, and not to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, that we are to understand these words, <q>This is the beginning of God's handiwork;</q>  for, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> can be a flaw or <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>  only where the nature previously was not vitiated. Vice, too, is so contrary to nature, that it cannot but damage it. And therefore departure from God would be no <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, unless in a nature whose property it was to abide with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So that even the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will is a strong <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the goodness of the nature. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as He is the supremely good Creator of good natures, so is He of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> wills the most just Ruler; so that, while they make an ill use of good natures, He makes a good use even of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> wills. Accordingly, He caused the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> (good by God's creation, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> by his own will) to be cast down from his high position, and to become the mockery of His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>&mdash;that is, He caused his <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> to benefit those whom he wishes to injure by them. And because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He created him, was certainly not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his future malignity, and foresaw the good which He Himself would bring out of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, therefore says the psalm, <q>This leviathan whom You have made to be a sport therein,</q>  that we may see that, even while God in His goodness created him good, He yet had already foreseen and arranged how He would make use of him when he became <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; Of the Beauty of the Universe, Which Becomes, by God's Ordinance, More Brilliant by the Opposition of Contraries.</h2>

<p>For God would never have created any, I do not say <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but even man, whose future <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> He foreknew, unless He had equally <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to what uses in behalf of the  good He could turn him, thus embellishing, the course of the ages, as it were an exquisite poem set off with antitheses. For what are called antitheses are among the most elegant of the ornaments of speech. They might be called in Latin <q>oppositions,</q> or, to speak more accurately, <q>contrapositions;</q> but this word is not in common use among us,  though the Latin, and indeed the languages of all nations, avail themselves of the same ornaments of style. In the Second Epistle to the Corinthians the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> also makes a graceful use of antithesis, in that place where he says, <q>By the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, by <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and dishonor, by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> report and good report: as deceivers, and yet <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120489"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:7-10</a></span> As, then, these oppositions of contraries lend beauty to the language, so the beauty of the course of this world is achieved by the opposition of contraries, arranged, as it were, by an eloquence not of words, but of things. This is quite plainly stated in the Book of Ecclesiasticus, in this way: <q>Good is set against <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and life against death: so is the sinner against the godly. So look upon all the works of the Most High, and these are two and two, one against another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120490"><a href="../bible/sir033.htm#verse15">Sirach&nbsp;33:15</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; What, Seemingly, We are to Understand by the Words, <q>God Divided the Light from the Darkness.</q></h2>

<p>Accordingly, though the obscurity of the divine word has certainly this advantage, that it causes many opinions about the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to be started and discussed, each reader seeing some fresh meaning in it, yet, whatever is said to be meant by an obscure passage should be either confirmed by the testimony of obvious facts, or should be asserted in other and less ambiguous texts. This obscurity is beneficial, whether the sense of the author is at last reached after the discussion of many other interpretations, or whether, though that sense remain concealed, other truths are brought out by the discussion of the obscurity. &nbsp;To me it does not seem incongruous with the working of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if we understand that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were created when that first light was made, and that a separation was made between the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and the unclean <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, when, as is said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> divided the light from the darkness; and God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night.</q> For He alone could make this discrimination, who was able also before they fell, to foreknow that they would fall, and that, being deprived of the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they would abide in the darkness of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For, so far as regards the day and night, with which we are familiar, He commanded those luminaries of heaven that are obvious to our senses to divide between the light and the darkness. <q>Let there be,</q> He says, <q>lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night;</q> and shortly after He says, <q>And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120491"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;1:14-18</a></span> But between that light, which is the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> company of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> spiritually radiant with the illumination of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and that opposing darkness, which is the noisome foulness of the spiritual condition of those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are turned away from the light of righteousness, only He Himself could divide, from whom their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> (not of nature, but of will), while yet it was future, could not be hidden or uncertain.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; Of the Words Which Follow the Separation of Light and Darkness, <q>And God Saw the Light that It Was Good.</q></h2>

<p>Then, we must not pass from this passage of Scripture without noticing that when God said, <q>Let there be light, and there was light,</q> it was immediately added, <q>And God saw the light that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q> No such expression followed the statement that He separated the light from the darkness, and called the light Day and the darkness Night, lest the seal of His approval might seem to be set on such darkness, as well as on the light. For when the darkness was not subject of disapprobation, as when it was divided by the heavenly bodies from this light which our eyes discern, the statement that God saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is inserted, not before, but after the division is recorded. <q>And God set them,</q> so runs the passage, <q>in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q> For He approved of both, because both were sinless. But where God said, <q>Let there be light, and there was light; and God saw the  light that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>;</q> and the narrative goes on, <q>and God divided the light from the darkness! And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night,</q> there was not in this place subjoined the statement, <q>And God saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>,</q> lest both should be designated good, while one of them was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not by nature, but by its own fault. And therefore, in this case, the light alone received the approbation of the Creator, while the angelic darkness, though it had been ordained, was yet not approved.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.&mdash; Of God's Eternal and Unchangeable Knowledge and Will, Whereby All He Has Made Pleased Him in the Eternal Design as Well as in the Actual Result.</h2>

<p>For what else is to be understood by that invariable refrain, <q>And God saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>,</q> than the approval of the work in its design, which is the wisdom of God? For certainly God did not in the actual achievement of the work first learn that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but, on the contrary, nothing would have been made had it not been first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by Him. While, therefore, He sees that that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which, had He not seen it before it was made, would never have been made, it is plain that He is not discovering, but teaching that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, indeed, was bold enough to say that, when the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> was completed, God was, as it were, elated with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.  And <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> was not so foolish as to mean by this that God was rendered more blessed by the novelty of His creation; but he wished thus to indicate that the work now completed met with its Maker's approval, as it had while yet in design. It is not as if the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God were of various kinds, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> in different ways things which as yet are not, things which are, and things which have been. For not in our fashion does He look forward to what is future, nor at what is present, nor back upon what is past; but in a manner quite different and far and profoundly remote from our way of thinking. For He does not pass from this to that by transition of thought, but beholds all things with absolute unchangeableness; so that of those things which emerge in time, the future, indeed, are not yet, and the present are now, and the past no longer are; but all of these are by Him comprehended in His stable and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> presence. Neither does He see in one fashion by the eye, in another by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, for He is not composed of mind and body; nor does His present <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> differ from that which it ever was or shall be, for those variations of time, past, present, and future, though they alter our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, do not affect His, <q>with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120493"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse17">James&nbsp;1:17</a></span> Neither is there any growth from thought to thought in the conceptions of Him in whose spiritual vision all things which He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> are at once embraced. For as without any movement that time can measure, He Himself moves all temporal things, so He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all times with a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that time cannot measure. And therefore He saw that what He had made was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, when He saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to make it. And when He saw it made, He had not on that account a twofold nor any way increased <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it; as if He had less <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> before He made what He saw. For certainly He would not be the perfect worker He is, unless His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> were so perfect as to receive no addition from His finished works. Wherefore, if the only object had been to inform us who made the light, it had been enough to say, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the light;</q> and if further information regarding the means by which it was made had been intended, it would have sufficed to say, <q>And God said, Let there be light, and there was light,</q> that we might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not only that God had made the world, but also that He had made it by the word. But because it was right that three leading truths regarding the creature be intimated to us, viz., who made it, by what means, and why, it is written, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said, Let there be light, and there was light. And God saw the light that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q> If, then, we ask who made it, it was <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> If, by what means, He said <q>Let it be,</q> and it was. If we ask, why He made it, <q>it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q> Neither is there any author more excellent than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor any skill more efficacious than the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> better than that good might be created by the good God. This also <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> has assigned as the most sufficient reason for the creation of the world, that good works might be made by a good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;  whether he read this passage, or, perhaps, was informed of these things by those who had read them, or, by his quick-sighted genius, penetrated to things spiritual and invisible through the things that are created, or was instructed regarding them by those who had discerned them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; Of Those Who Do Not Approve of Certain Things Which are a Part of This Good Creation of a Good Creator, and Who Think that There is Some Natural Evil.</h2>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, however, of a good creation, namely, the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, I say, so just and fit, which, when piously and carefully weighed, terminates all the controversies of those who inquire into the origin of the world, has not been recognized by some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>,  because there are, forsooth, many things, such as fire, frost, wild beasts, and so forth, which do not suit but injure this thin blooded and frail mortality of our flesh, which is at present under <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> punishment. They do not consider how admirable these things are in their own places, how excellent in their own natures, how beautifully adjusted to the rest of creation, and how much <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> they contribute to the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> by their own contributions as to a commonwealth; and how serviceable they are even to ourselves, if we use them with a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their fit adaptations,&mdash; so that even poisons, which are destructive when used injudiciously, become wholesome and medicinal when used in conformity with their qualities and design; just as, on the other hand, those things which give us pleasure, such as food, drink, and the light of the sun, are found to be hurtful when immoderately or unseasonably used. And thus <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a> admonishes us not foolishly to vituperate things, but to investigate their utility with care; and, where our mental capacity or infirmity is at fault, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is a utility, though hidden, as we have experienced that there were other things which we all but failed to discover. For this concealment of the use of things is itself either an exercise of our humility or a levelling of our <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; for no nature at all is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and this is a name for nothing but the want of good. But from things earthly to things heavenly, from the visible to the invisible, there are some things better than others; and for this purpose are they unequal, in order that they might all exist. Now God is in such sort a great worker in great things, that He is not less in little things&mdash;for these little things are to be measured not by their own greatness (which does not exist), but by the wisdom of their Designer; as, in the visible appearance of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if one eyebrow be shaved off, how nearly nothing is taken from the body, but how much from the beauty!&mdash; for that is not constituted by bulk, but by the proportion and arrangement of the members. But we do not greatly wonder that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who suppose that some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> nature has been generated and propagated by a kind of opposing principle proper to it, refuse to admit that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the creation was this, that the good God produced a good creation. For they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He was driven to this enterprise of creation by the urgent necessity of repulsing the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that warred against Him, and that He mixed His good nature with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for the sake of restraining and conquering it; and that this nature of His, being thus shamefully polluted, and most cruelly oppressed and held captive, He labors to cleanse and deliver it, and with all His pains does not wholly succeed; but such part of it as could not be cleansed from that defilement is to serve as a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and chain of the conquered and incarcerated enemy. The <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> would not drivel, or rather, rave in such a style as this, if they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God to be, as it is, unchangeable and absolutely incorruptible, and subject to no injury; and if, moreover, they held in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sobriety, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which has shown itself capable of being altered for the worse by its own will, and of being corrupted by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and so, of being deprived of the light of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash;that this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, I say, is not a part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor of the same nature as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but is created by Him, and is far different from its Creator.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.&mdash; Of the Error in Which the Doctrine of Origen is Involved.</h2>

<p>But it is much more surprising that some even of those who, with ourselves, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is one only source of all things, and that no nature which is not divine can exist unless originated by that Creator, have yet refused to accept with a good and simple <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> this so good and simple a reason of the world's creation, that a good God made it good; and that the things created, being different from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were inferior to Him, and yet were good, being created by none other than He. But they say that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, though not, indeed, parts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but created by Him, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> by abandoning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that, in proportion to their various <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, they merited different degrees of debasement from heaven to earth, and diverse bodies as prison-houses; and that this is the world, and this the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its creation, not the production of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, but the restraining of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> blamed for holding this opinion. For in the books which he entitles <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x1F76; &#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03C7;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;</span>, that is, <em>Of Origins</em>, this is his sentiment, this his utterance. And I can  not sufficiently express my astonishment, that a man so erudite and well versed in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> literature, should not have observed, in the first place, how opposed this is to the meaning of this authoritative Scripture, which, in recounting all the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, regularly adds, <q>And God saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>;</q> and, when all were completed, inserts the words, <q>And God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120496"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse31">Genesis&nbsp;1:31</a></span> Was it not obviously meant to be understood that there was no other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the world's creation than that good creatures should be made by a good God? In this creation, had no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, the world would have been filled and beautified with natures good without exception; and though there is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, all things are not therefore full of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for the great majority of the heavenly inhabitants preserve their nature's integrity. And the sinful will though it violated the order of its own nature, did not on that account escape the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> orders all things for good. For as the beauty of a picture is increased by well-managed shadows, so, to the eye that has skill to discern it, the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is beautified even by sinners, though, considered by themselves, their deformity is a sad blemish.</p>

<p>In the second place, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and all who think with him, ought to have seen that if it were the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinion that the world was created in order that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> might, for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, be accommodated with bodies in which they should be shut up as in houses of correction, the more venial sinners receiving lighter and more ethereal bodies, while the grosser and graver sinners received bodies more crass and grovelling, then it would follow that the devils, who are deepest in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, ought, rather than even <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, to have earthly bodies, since these are the grossest and least ethereal of all. But in point of fact, that we might see that the deserts of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are not to be estimated by the qualities of bodies, the wickedest <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> possesses an ethereal body, while man, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but with a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> small and venial in comparison with his, received even before his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> a body of clay. And what more foolish assertion can be advanced than that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by this sun of ours, did not design to benefit the material creation, or lend lustre to its loveliness, and therefore created one single sun for this single world, but that it so happened that one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> only had so <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> as to deserve to be enclosed in such a body as it is? On this principle, if it had chanced that not one, but two, yea, or ten, or a hundred had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> similarly, and with a like degree of guilt, then this world would have one hundred suns. And that such is not the case, is due not to the considerate foresight of the Creator, contriving the safety and beauty of things material, but rather to the fact that so fine a quality of sinning was hit upon by only one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so that it alone has merited such a body. Manifestly <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> holding such opinions should aim at confining, not <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they say, but themselves, lest they fall, and deservedly, far indeed from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And as to these three answers which I formerly recommended when in the case of any creature the questions are put, Who made it? By what means? Why? That it should be replied, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, By the Word, Because it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>&mdash;as to these three answers, it is very questionable whether the Trinity itself is thus <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> indicated, that is, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, or whether there is some good reason for this acceptation in this passage of Scripture,&mdash; this, I say, is questionable, and one can't be expected to explain everything in one volume.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.&mdash; Of the Divine Trinity, and the Indications of Its Presence Scattered Everywhere Among Its Works.</h2>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, we maintain, we faithfully preach, that the Father begot the Word, that is, Wisdom, by which all things were made, the only-begotten Son, one as the Father is one, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> as the Father is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and, equally with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, supremely good; and that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is the Spirit alike of Father and of Son, and is Himself consubstantial and co-eternal with both; and that this whole is a Trinity by reason of the individuality  of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and one God by reason of the indivisible divine substance, as also one Almighty by reason of the indivisible omnipotence; yet so that, when we inquire regarding each singly, it is said that each is God and Almighty; and, when we speak of all together, it is said that there are not three Gods, nor three Almighties, but one God Almighty; so great is the indivisible unity of these Three, which requires that it be so stated. But, whether the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who are both good, can be with propriety called the goodness of both, because He is common to both, I do not presume to determine hastily. Nevertheless, I would have less hesitation in saying  that He is the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of both, not as if He were a divine attribute merely, but Himself also the divine substance, and the third person in the Trinity. I am the rather emboldened to make this statement, because, though the Father is a spirit, and the Son a spirit, and the Father <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and the Son <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, yet the third person is distinctively called the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as if He were the substantial <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> consubstantial with the other two. But if the divine goodness is nothing else than the divine <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, then certainly it is a reasonable studiousness, and not presumptuous intrusion, to inquire whether the same Trinity be not hinted at in an enigmatical mode of speech, by which our inquiry is stimulated, when it is written who made each creature, and by what means, and why. For it is the Father of the Word who said, Let there be. And that which was made when He spoke was certainly made by means of the Word. And by the words, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>,</q> it is sufficiently intimated that God made what was made not from any necessity, nor for the sake of supplying any want, but solely from His own goodness, <em> i.e</em>., because it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And this is stated after the creation had taken place, that there might be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the thing made satisfied the goodness on account of which it was made. And if we are right in understanding; that this goodness is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, then the whole Trinity is revealed to us in the creation. In this, too, is the origin, the enlightenment, the blessedness of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city which is above among the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For if we inquire whence it is, God created it; or whence its wisdom, God illumined it; or whence its blessedness, God is its bliss. It has its form by subsisting in Him; its enlightenment by contemplating Him; its <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> by abiding in Him. It is; it sees; it loves. In God's <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is its life; in God's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> its light; in God's goodness its <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25.&mdash; Of the Division of Philosophy into Three Parts.</h2>

<p>As far as one can judge, it is for the same reason that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have aimed at a threefold division of science, or rather, were enabled to see that there was a threefold division (for they did not invent, but only discovered it), of which one part is called physical, another <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>, the third ethical. The Latin equivalents of these names are now naturalized in the writings of many authors, so that these divisions are called natural, rational, and moral, on which I have touched slightly in the eighth book. Not that I would conclude that these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, in this threefold division, had any thought of a trinity in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> is said to have been the first to discover and promulgate this distribution, and he saw that God alone could be the author of nature, the bestower of intelligence, and the kindler of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> by which life becomes good and blessed. But certain it is that, though <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> disagree both regarding the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things, and the mode of investigating <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and of the good to which all our actions ought to tend, yet in these three great general questions all their intellectual energy is spent. And though there be a confusing diversity of opinion, every man striving to establish his own opinion in regard to each of these questions, yet no one of them all doubts that nature has some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, science some method, life some end and aim. Then, again, there are three things which every artificer must possess if he is to effect anything&mdash;nature, education, practice. Nature is to be judged by capacity, education by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, practice by its fruit. I am aware that, properly speaking, fruit is what one enjoys, use [practice] what one uses. And this seems to be the difference between them, that we are said to <em>enjoy</em> that which in itself, and irrespective of other ends, delights us; to use that which we seek for the sake of some end beyond. For which reason the things of time are to be used rather than enjoyed, that we may deserve to enjoy things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; and not as those perverse creatures who would fain enjoy money and use <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;not spending money for God's sake, but <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">worshipping</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for money's sake. However, in common parlance, we both use fruits and enjoy uses. For we correctly speak of the <q>fruits of the field,</q> which certainly we all use in the present life. And it was in accordance with this usage that I said that there were three things to be observed in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nature, education, practice. From these the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have elaborated, as I said, the threefold division of that science by which a blessed life is attained: the natural having respect to nature, the rational to education, the moral to practice. If, then, we were ourselves the authors of our nature, we should have generated <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in ourselves, and should not require to reach it by education, <em> i.e</em>., by learning it from others. Our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, too, proceeding from ourselves and returning to us, would suffice to make our life blessed, and would stand in need of no extraneous enjoyment. But now, since our nature has God as its requisite author, it is certain that we must have Him for our teacher that we may be wise; Him, too, to dispense to us spiritual sweetness that we may be blessed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.&mdash; Of the Image of the Supreme Trinity, Which We Find in Some Sort in Human Nature Even in Its Present State.</h2>

<p>And we indeed recognize in ourselves the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, of the supreme Trinity, an image which, though it be not equal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or rather, though it be very far removed from Him&mdash;being neither co-eternal, nor, to say all in a word, consubstantial with Him&mdash;is yet nearer to Him in nature than any other of His works, and is destined to be yet restored, that it may bear a still closer resemblance. For we both are, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we are, and delight in our being, and our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it. Moreover, in these three things no true-seeming illusion disturbs us; for we do not come into contact with these by some bodily sense, as we perceive the things outside of us&mdash;colors, <em>e.g</em>., by seeing, sounds by hearing, smells by smelling, tastes by tasting, hard and soft objects by touching&mdash;of all which sensible objects it is the images resembling them, but not themselves which we perceive in the mind and hold in the memory, and which excite us to desire the objects. But, without any delusive representation of images or phantasms, I am most certain that I am, and that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and delight in this. In respect of these truths, I am not at all afraid of the arguments of the Academicians, who say, What if you are deceived? For if I am deceived, I am.  For he who is not, cannot be deceived; and if I am deceived, by this same token I am. And since I am if I am deceived, how am I deceived in believing that I am? For it is certain that I am if I am deceived. Since, therefore, I, the person deceived, should be, even if I were deceived, certainly I am not deceived in this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that I am. And, consequently, neither am I deceived in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. For, as I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am, so I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this also, that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. And when I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> these two things, I add to them a certain third thing, namely, my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which is of equal moment. For neither am I deceived in this, that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, since in those things which I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> I am not deceived; though even if these were false, it would still be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that I <em>loved</em> false things. For how could I <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> be blamed and prohibited from loving false things, if it were false that I loved them? But, since they are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and real, who doubts that when they are loved, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of them is itself <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and real? Further, as there is no one who does not wish to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, so there is no one who does not wish to be. For how can he be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, if he is nothing?</p>

<h2>Chapter 27.&mdash; Of Existence, and Knowledge of It, and the Love of Both.</h2>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the very fact of existing is by some natural spell so pleasant, that even the wretched are, for no other reason, unwilling to perish; and, when they feel that they are wretched, wish not that they themselves be annihilated, but that their misery be so. Take even those who, both in their own esteem, and in point of fact, are utterly wretched, and who are reckoned so, not only by wise men on account of their folly, but by those who count themselves blessed, and who think them wretched because they are poor and destitute&mdash;if any one should give these men an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, in which their misery should be deathless, and should offer the alternative, that if they shrank from existing <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> in the same misery they might be annihilated, and exist nowhere at all, nor in any condition, on the instant they would joyfully, nay exultantly, make election to exist always, even in such a condition, rather than not exist at all. The well-known feeling of such men witnesses to this. For when we see that they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to die, and will rather live in such misfortune than end it by death, is it not obvious enough how nature shrinks from annihilation? And, accordingly, when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they must die, they seek, as a great boon, that this mercy be shown them, that they may a little longer live in the same misery, and delay to end it by death. And so they indubitably prove with what glad alacrity they would accept <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, even though it secured to them endless destruction. What! Do not even all irrational animals, to whom such calculations are unknown, from the huge dragons down to the least worms, all testify that they wish to exist, and therefore shun death by every movement in their power? Nay, the very plants and shrubs, which have no such life as enables them to shun destruction by movements we can see, do not they all seek in their own fashion to conserve their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, by rooting themselves more and more deeply in the earth, that so they may draw nourishment, and throw out healthy branches towards the sky? In fine, even the lifeless bodies, which want not only sensation but seminal life, yet either seek the upper air or sink deep, or are balanced in an intermediate position, so that they may protect their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in that situation where they can exist in most accordance with their nature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;And how much <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> loves the  <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and how it shrinks from being deceived, will be sufficiently understood from this fact, that every man prefers to grieve in a sane <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, rather than to be glad in <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. And this grand and wonderful instinct belongs to men alone of all animals; for, though some of them have keener eyesight than ourselves for this world's light, they cannot attain to that spiritual light with which our mind is somehow irradiated, so that we can form right judgments of all things. For our power to judge is proportioned to our acceptance of this light. Nevertheless, the irrational animals, though they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, have certainly something resembling <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; whereas the other material things are said to be sensible, not because they have senses, but because they are the objects of our senses. Yet among plants, their nourishment and generation have some resemblance to sensible life. However, both these and all material things have their causes hidden in their nature; but their outward forms, which lend beauty to this visible structure of the world, are perceived by our senses, so that they seem to wish to compensate for their own want of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by providing us with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But we perceive them by our bodily senses in such a way that we do not judge of them by these senses. For we have another and far superior sense, belonging to the inner man, by which we perceive what things are just, and what <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>&mdash;just by means of an intelligible idea, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> by the want of it. This sense is aided in its functions neither by the eyesight, nor by the orifice of the ear, nor by the air-holes of the nostrils, nor by the palate's taste, nor by any bodily touch. By it I am assured both that I am, and that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this; and these two I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and in the same manner I am assured that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28.&mdash; Whether We Ought to Love the Love Itself with Which We Love Our Existence and Our Knowledge of It, that So We May More Nearly Resemble the Image of the Divine Trinity.</h2>

<p>We have said as much as the scope of this work demands regarding these two things, to wit, our <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it, and how much they are loved by us, and how there is found even in the lower creatures a kind of likeness of these things, and yet with a difference. We have yet to speak of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wherewith they are loved, to determine whether this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself is loved. And doubtless it is; and this is the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. Because in men who are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> loved, it is rather <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself that is loved; for he is not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> called a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but who loves it. Is it not then obvious that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in ourselves the very <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wherewith we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> whatever good we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? For there is also a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wherewith we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that which we ought not to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; and this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by him who loves that wherewith he loves what ought to be loved. For it is quite possible for both to exist in one man. And this co-existence is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to the end that this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which conduces to our living well may grow, and the other, which leads us to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may decrease, until our whole life be perfectly healed and transmuted into good. For if we were beasts, we should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the fleshly and sensual life, and this would be our sufficient good; and when it was well with us in respect of it, we should seek nothing beyond. In like manner, if we were trees, we could not, indeed, in the strict sense of the word, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> anything; nevertheless we should seem, as it were, to long for that by which we might become more abundantly and luxuriantly fruitful. If we were stones, or waves, or wind, or flame, or anything of that kind, we should want, indeed, both sensation and life, yet should possess a kind of attraction towards our own proper position and natural order. For the specific gravity of bodies is, as it were, their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, whether they are carried downwards by their weight, or upwards by their levity. For the body is borne by its gravity, as the spirit by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, wherever it is borne.  But we are men, created in the image of our Creator, whose <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and whose <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and who Himself is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and adorable Trinity, without confusion, without separation; and, therefore, while, as we run over all the works which He has established, we may detect, as it were, His footprints, now more and now less distinct even in those things that are beneath us, since they could not so much as exist, or be bodied forth in any shape, or follow and observe any law, had they not been made by Him who supremely is, and is supremely good and supremely wise; yet in ourselves beholding His image, let us, like that younger son of the gospel, come to ourselves, and arise and return to Him from whom by our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> we had departed. There our being will have no death, our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> no mishap. But now, though we are assured of our possession of these three things, not on the testimony of others, but by our own consciousness of their presence, and because we see them with our own most truthful interior vision, yet, as we cannot of our  selves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how long they are to continue, and whether they shall never cease to be, and what issue their good or bad use will lead to, we seek for others who can acquaint us of these things, if we have not already found them. Of the trustworthiness of these witnesses, there will, not now, but subsequently, be an opportunity of speaking. But in this book let us go on as we have begun, with God's help, to speak of the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not in its state of pilgrimage and mortality, but as it exists ever <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> in the heavens,&mdash; that is, let us speak of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who maintain their allegiance to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who never were, nor ever shall be, <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, between whom and those who forsook light <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and became darkness, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as we have already said, made at the first a separation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29.&mdash; Of the Knowledge by Which the Holy Angels Know God in His Essence, and by Which They See the Causes of His Works in the Art of the Worker, Before They See Them in the Works of the Artist.</h2>

<p>Those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God not by audible words, but by the presence to their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of immutable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <em>i.e</em>., of the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>; and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this Word Himself, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and that this Trinity is indivisible, and that the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of it are one substance, and that there are not three Gods but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this they so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is better understood by them than we are by ourselves. Thus, too, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the creature also, not in itself, but by this better way, in the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as if in the art by which it was created; and, consequently, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> themselves better in God than in themselves, though they have also this latter <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For they were created, and are different from their Creator. In Him, therefore, they have, as it were, a noonday <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; in themselves, a twilight <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, according to our former explanations.  For there is a great difference between <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> a thing in the design in conformity to which it was made, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it in itself&mdash; <em>e.g</em>., the straightness of lines and correctness of figures is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in one way when mentally conceived, in another when described on paper; and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in one way in the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in another in the spirit of a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man. So is it with all other things&mdash;as, the firmament between the water above and below, which was called the heaven; the gathering of the waters beneath, and the laying bare of the dry land, and the production of plants and trees; the creation of sun, moon, and stars; and of the animals out of the waters, fowls, and fish, and monsters of the deep; and of everything that walks or creeps on the earth, and of man himself, who excels all that is on the earth&mdash;all these things are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in one way by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, in which they see the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> abiding causes and reasons according to which they were made, and in another way in themselves: in the former, with a clearer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; in the latter, with a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> dimmer, and rather of the bare works than of the design. Yet, when these works are referred to the praise and adoration of the Creator Himself, it is as if morning dawned in the minds of those who contemplate them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30.&mdash; Of the Perfection of the Number Six, Which is the First of the Numbers Which is Composed of Its Aliquot Parts.</h2>

<p>These works are recorded to have been completed in six days (the same day being six times repeated), because six is a perfect number&mdash;not because God required a protracted time, as if He could not at once create all things, which then should mark the course of time by the movements proper to them, but because the perfection of the works was signified by the number six. For the number six is the first which is made up of its own  parts, <em> i.e</em>., of its sixth, third, and half, which are respectively one, two, and three, and which make a total of six. In this way of looking at a number, those are said to be its parts which exactly divide it, as a half, a third, a fourth, or a fraction with any denominator, <em>e.g</em>., four is a part of nine, but not therefore an aliquot part; but one is, for it is the ninth part; and three is, for it is the third. Yet these two parts, the ninth and the third, or one and three, are far from making its whole sum of nine. So again, in the number ten, four is a part, yet does not divide it; but one is an aliquot part, for it is a tenth; so it has a fifth, which is two; and a half, which is five. But these three parts, a tenth, a fifth, and a half, or one, two, and five, added together, do not make ten, but eight. Of the number twelve, again, the parts added together exceed the whole; for it has a twelfth, that is, one; a sixth, or two; a fourth, which is three; a third, which is four; and a half, which is six. But one, two, three, four, and six make up, not twelve, but more, viz., sixteen. So much I have thought fit to state for the sake of illustrating  the perfection of the number six, which is, as I said, the first which is exactly made up of its own parts added together; and in this number of days God finished His work.  And, therefore, we must not despise the science of numbers, which, in many passages of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, is found to be of eminent service to the careful interpreter.  Neither has it been without reason numbered among God's praises, <q>You have ordered all things in number, and measure, and weight.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120504"><a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse20">Wisdom&nbsp;11:20</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 31.&mdash; Of the Seventh Day, in Which Completeness and Repose are Celebrated.</h2>

<p>But, on the seventh day (<em>i.e</em>., the same day repeated seven times, which number is also a perfect one, though for another reason), the rest of God is set forth, and then, too, we first hear of its being hallowed. So that God did not wish to hallow this day by His works, but by His rest, which has no evening, for it is not a creature; so that, being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in one way in the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and in another in itself, it should make a twofold <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, daylight and dusk (day and evening). Much more might be said about the perfection of the number seven, but this book is already too long, and I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest I should seem to catch at an opportunity of airing my little smattering of science more childishly than profitably. I must speak, therefore, in moderation and with dignity, lest, in too keenly following <q>number,</q> I be accused of forgetting <q>weight</q> and <q>measure.</q> Suffice it here to say, that three is the first whole number that is odd, four the first that is even, and of these two, seven is composed. On this account it is often put for all numbers together, as, <q>A just man falls seven times, and rises up again,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120505"><a href="../bible/pro024.htm#verse16">Proverbs&nbsp;24:16</a></span> &mdash; that is, let him fall never so often, he will not perish (and this was meant to be understood not of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but of afflictions conducing to lowliness). Again, <q>Seven times a day will I praise You,</q>  which elsewhere is expressed thus, <q>I will bless the Lord <em>at all times</em>.</q>  And many such instances are found in the divine authorities, in which the number seven is, as I said, commonly used to express the whole, or the completeness of anything. And so the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, of whom the Lord says, <q>He will teach you all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120508"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;16:13</a></span> is signified by this number.  In it is the rest of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the rest His people find in Him. For rest is in the whole, <em>i.e</em>., in perfect completeness, while in the part there is labor. And thus we labor as long as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part; <q>but when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part shall be done away.</q>  It is even with toil we search into the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> themselves. But the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, towards whose society and assembly we sigh while in this our toilsome pilgrimage, as they already abide in their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> home, so do they enjoy perfect facility of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and felicity of rest. It is without difficulty that they help us; for their spiritual movements, pure and free, cost them no effort.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32.&mdash; Of the Opinion that the Angels Were Created Before the World.</h2>

<p>But if some one oppose our opinion, and say that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not referred to when it is said, <q>Let there be light, and there was light;</q> if he suppose or teach that some material light, then first created, was meant, and that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were created, not only before the firmament dividing the waters and named <q>the heaven,</q> but also before the time signified in the words, <q>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth;</q> if he allege that this phrase, <q>In the beginning,</q> does not mean that nothing was made before (for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were), but that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made all things by His Wisdom or Word, who is named in Scripture <q>the Beginning,</q> as He Himself, in the gospel, replied to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> when they asked Him who He was, that He was the Beginning; &mdash; I will not contest the point, chiefly because it gives me the liveliest satisfaction to find the Trinity celebrated in the very beginning of the book of Genesis. For having said <q>In the Beginning God created the heaven and the earth,</q> meaning that the Father made them in the Son (as the psalm testifies where it says, <q>How manifold are Your works, O Lord! In Wisdom have You made them all</q> ), a little afterwards mention is fitly made of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also. For, when it had been told us what kind of earth God created at first, or what the mass or matter was which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, under the name of <q>heaven and earth,</q> had provided for the construction of the world, as is told in the additional words, <q>And the earth was without <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep,</q> then, for the sake of completing the mention of the Trinity, it is immediately added, <q>And the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> moved upon the face of the waters.</q> Let  each one, then, take it as he pleases; for it is so profound a passage, that it may well suggest, for the exercise of the reader's tact, many opinions, and none of them widely departing from the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. At the same time, let none <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in their heavenly abodes are, though not, indeed, co-eternal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet secure and certain of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> felicity. To their company the Lord teaches that His little ones belong; and not only says, <q>They shall be equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120513"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;22:30</a></span> but shows, too, what blessed <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> themselves enjoy, saying, <q>Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones: for I say unto you, that in heaven their <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120514"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;18:10</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 33.&mdash; Of the Two Different and Dissimilar Communities of Angels, Which are Not Inappropriately Signified by the Names Light and Darkness.</h2>

<p>That certain <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and were thrust down to the lowest parts of this world, where they are, as it were, incarcerated till their final damnation in the day of judgment, the Apostle Peter very plainly declares, when he says that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spared not the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, but cast them down to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved into judgment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120515"><a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:4</a></span> Who, then, can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, either in foreknowledge or in act, separated between these and the rest? And who will dispute that the rest are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> called <q>light?</q> For even we who are yet living by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hoping only and not yet enjoying equality with them, are already called <q>light</q> by the apostle: <q>For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120516"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> But as for these <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, all who understand or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them to be worse than unbelieving men are well aware that they are called <q>darkness.</q> Wherefore, though light and darkness are to be taken in their literal signification in these passages of Genesis in which it is said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said, Let there be light, and there was light,</q> and <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> divided the light from the darkness,</q> yet, for our part, we understand these two societies of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>&mdash;the one enjoying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other swelling with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; the one to whom it is said, <q>Praise Him, all His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q>  the other whose prince says, <q>All these things will I give You if You will fall down and worship me;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120518"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;4:9</a></span> the one blazing with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other reeking with the unclean <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of self-advancement.

These two angelic communities, then, dissimilar and contrary to one another, the one both by nature good and by will upright, the other also good by nature but by will depraved, as they are exhibited in other and more explicit passages of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writ, so I think they are spoken of in this book of Genesis under the names of light and darkness; and even if the author perhaps had a different meaning, yet our discussion of the obscure language has not been wasted time; for, though we have been unable to discover his meaning, yet we have adhered to the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is sufficiently ascertained by the faithful from other passages of equal authority. For, though it is the material works of God which are here spoken of, they have certainly a resemblance to the spiritual, so that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> can say, <q>You are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120520"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:5</a></span> If, on the other hand, the author of Genesis saw in the words what we see, then our discussion reaches this more satisfactory conclusion, that the man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so eminently and divinely wise, or rather, that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> who by him recorded God's works which were finished on the sixth day, may be supposed not to have omitted all mention of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> whether he included them in the words <q>in the beginning,</q> because He made them first, or, which seems most likely, because He made them in the only-begotten Word. And, under these names heaven and earth, the whole creation is signified, either as divided into spiritual and material, which seems the more likely, or into the two great parts of the world in which all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things are contained, so that, first of all, the creation is presented in sum, and  then its parts are enumerated according to the mystic number of the days.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34.&mdash; Of the Idea that the Angels Were Meant Where the Separation of the Waters by the Firmament is Spoken Of, and of that Other Idea that the Waters Were Not Created.</h2>

<p>Some,  however, have supposed that the angelic hosts are somehow referred to under the name of waters, and that this is what is meant by <q>Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120522"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;1:6</a></span> that the waters above should be understood of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and those below either of the visible waters, or of the multitude of bad <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or of the nations of men. If this be so, then it does not here appear when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were created, but when they were separated. Though there have not been wanting men foolish and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> enough  to deny that the waters were made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because it is nowhere written, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said, Let there be waters.</q> With equal folly they might say the same of the earth, for nowhere do we read, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said, Let the earth be.</q> But, say they, it is written, <q>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</q> Yes, and there the water is meant, for both are included in one word. For <q>the sea is His,</q> as the psalm says, <q>and He made it; and His hands formed the dry land.</q>  But those who would understand the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by the waters above the skies have a difficulty about the specific gravity of the elements, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that the waters, owing to their fluidity and weight, could not be set in the upper parts of the world. So that, if they were to construct a man upon their own principles, they would not put in his head any moist humors, or <q>phlegm</q> as the Greeks call it, and which acts the part of water among the elements of our body. But, in God's handiwork, the head is the seat of the phlegm, and surely most fitly; and yet, according to their supposition, so absurdly that if we were not aware of the fact, and were informed by this same record that God had put a moist and cold and therefore heavy humor in the uppermost part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> body, these world-weighers would refuse belief. And if they were confronted with the authority of Scripture, they would maintain that something else must be meant by the words. But, were we to investigate and discover all the details which are written in this divine book regarding the creation of the world, we should have much to say, and should widely digress from the proposed aim of this work. Since, then, we have now said what seemed needful regarding these two diverse and contrary communities of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in which the origin of the two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> communities (of which we intend to speak soon) is also found, let us at once bring this book also to a conclusion.</p>
