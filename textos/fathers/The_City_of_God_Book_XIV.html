<h1>The City of God (Book XIV)</h1>

<p class="h1a">Augustine again treats of the sin of the first man, and teaches that it is the cause of the carnal life and vicious affections of man. Especially he proves that the shame which accompanies lust is the just punishment of that disobedience, and inquires how man, if he had not sinned, would have been able without lust to propagate his kind.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; That the Disobedience of the First Man Would Have Plunged All Men into the Endless Misery of the Second Death, Had Not the Grace of God Rescued Many.</h2>

<p>We have already stated in the preceding books that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, desiring not only that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> might be able by their similarity of nature to associate with one another, but also that they might be bound together in harmony and peace by the ties of relationship, was pleased to derive all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from one individual, and created man with such a nature that the members of the race should not have died, had not the two first (of whom the one was created out of nothing, and the other out of him) merited this by their disobedience; for by them so great a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was committed, that by it the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> was altered for the worse, and was transmitted also to their posterity, liable to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and subject to death. And the kingdom of death so reigned over men, that the deserved penalty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would have hurled all headlong even into the second death, of which there is no end, had not the undeserved <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God saved some therefrom. And thus it has come to pass, that though there are very many and great nations all over the earth, whose <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> and customs, speech, arms, and dress, are distinguished by marked differences, yet there are no more than two kinds of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society, which we may <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> call two cities, according to the language of our Scriptures. The one consists of those who wish to live after the flesh, the other of those who wish to live after the spirit; and when they severally achieve what they wish, they live in peace, each after their kind.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; Of Carnal Life, Which is to Be Understood Not Only of Living in Bodily Indulgence, But Also of Living in the Vices of the Inner Man.</h2>

<p>First, we must see what it is to live after the flesh, and what to live after the spirit. For any one who either does not recollect, or does not sufficiently weigh, the language of sacred Scripture, may, on first hearing what we have said, suppose that the Epicurean <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> live after the flesh, because they place man's highest good in bodily pleasure; and that those others do so who have been of opinion that in some form or other bodily good is man's supreme good; and that the mass of men do so who, without dogmatizing or <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophizing</a> on the subject, are so prone to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> that they cannot delight in any pleasure save such as they receive from bodily sensations: and he may suppose that the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, who place the supreme good of men in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, live after the spirit; for what is man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, if not spirit? But in the sense of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> both are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to live after the flesh. For by flesh it means not only the body of a terrestrial and mortal animal, as when it says, <q>All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, another of  birds,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120639"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse39">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:39</a></span> but it uses this word in many other significations; and among these various usages, a frequent one is to use flesh for man himself, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of man taking the part for the whole, as in the words, <q>By the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the law there shall no flesh be justified;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120640"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;3:20</a></span> for what does he mean here by <q>no flesh</q> but <q>no man?</q> And this, indeed, he shortly after says more plainly: <q>No man shall be justified by the law;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120641"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse11">Galatians&nbsp;3:11</a></span> and in the Epistle to the Galatians, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> that man is not justified by the works of the law.</q> And so we understand the words, <q>And the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120642"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> &mdash; that is, man, which some not accepting in its right sense, have supposed that Christ had not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.  For as the whole is used for the part in the words of Mary Magdalene in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>They have taken away my Lord, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not where they have laid Him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120644"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;20:13</a></span> by which she meant only the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which she supposed had been taken from the tomb where it had been buried, so the part is used for the whole, flesh being named, while man is referred to, as in the quotations above cited.</p>

<p>Since, then, Scripture uses the word flesh in many ways, which there is not time to collect and investigate, if we are to ascertain what it is to live after the flesh (which is certainly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, though the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of flesh is not itself <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>), we must carefully examine that passage of the epistle which the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> wrote to the Galatians, in which he says, <q>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, <a href="../cathen/15674b.htm">witchcraft</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, variance, emulations, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, strife, seditions, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, envyings, murders, <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120645"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians&nbsp;5:19-21</a></span> This whole passage of the apostolic epistle being considered, so far as it bears on the matter in hand, will be sufficient to answer the question, what it is to live after the flesh. For among the works of the flesh which he said were manifest, and which he cited for condemnation, we find not only those which concern the pleasure of the flesh, as fornications, uncleanness, lasciviousness, <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, revellings, but also those which, though they be remote from fleshly pleasure, reveal the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For who does not see that idolatries, witchcrafts, hatreds, variance, emulations, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, strife, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, envyings, are <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> rather of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than of the flesh? For it is quite possible for a man to abstain from fleshly pleasures for the sake of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> or some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; and yet, even when he does so, he is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by this apostolic authority to be living after the flesh; and in abstaining from fleshly pleasure, he is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be practising damnable works of the flesh. Who that has enmity has it not in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Or who would say to his enemy, or to the man he thinks his enemy, You have a bad flesh towards me, and not rather, You have a bad spirit towards me? In fine, if any one heard of what I may call <q>carnalities,</q> he would not fail to attribute them to the carnal part of man; so no one doubts that <q>animosities</q> belong to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man. Why then does the doctor of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and verity call all these and similar things works of the flesh, unless because, by that mode of speech whereby the part is used for the whole, he means us to understand by the word flesh the man himself?</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; That the Sin is Caused Not by the Flesh, But by the Soul, and that the Corruption Contracted from Sin is Not Sin But Sin's Punishment.</h2>

<p>But if any one says that the flesh is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and ill conduct, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> lives wickedly only because it is moved by the flesh, it is certain he has not carefully considered the whole nature of man. For <q>the corruptible body, indeed, weighs down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120646"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span> Whence, too, the apostle, speaking of this corruptible body, of which he had shortly before said, <q>though our outward man perish,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120647"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:16</a></span> says, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, an house not made with hands, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in the heavens. For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up in life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120648"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:1-4</a></span> We are then burdened with this corruptible body; but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this burdensomeness is not the nature and substance of the body, but its corruption, we do not desire to be deprived of the body, but to be clothed with its <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. For then, also, there will be a body, but it shall no longer be a burden, being no longer corruptible. At present, then, <q>the corruptible body presses down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the earthly tabernacle weighs down the mind that muses upon  many things,</q> nevertheless they are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> who suppose that all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> proceed from the body.</p>

<p>Virgil, indeed, seems to express the sentiments of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in the beautiful lines, where he says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>A fiery strength inspires their lives,

<br>An <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> that from heaven derives,

<br>Though clogged in part by limbs of clay

<br>And the dull 'vesture of decay;' 

<br>but though he goes on to mention the four most common mental emotions&mdash;desire, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, sorrow&mdash;with the intention of showing that the body is the origin of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, saying,&mdash;

<p>Hence wild desires and grovelling fears,

<br>And <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laughter, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> tears,

<br>Immured in dungeon-seeming nights

<br>They look abroad, yet see no light, 
</p></blockquote>

<p>yet we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> quite otherwise. For the corruption of the body, which weighs down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> but the punishment of the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and it was not the corruptible flesh that made the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sinful, but the sinful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that made the flesh corruptible. And though from this corruption of the flesh there arise certain incitements to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and indeed vicious desires, yet we must not attribute to the flesh all the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> life, in case we thereby clear the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> of all these, for he has no flesh. For though we cannot call the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> a fornicator or drunkard, or ascribe to him any sensual indulgence (though he is the secret instigator and prompter of those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in these ways), yet he is exceedingly <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>. And this viciousness has so possessed him, that on account of it he is reserved in chains of darkness to everlasting punishment.  Now these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, which have dominion over the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, the apostle attributes to the flesh, which certainly the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has not. For he says <q><a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, variance, emulations, strife, envying</q> are the works of the flesh; and of all these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is the origin and head, and it rules in the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> though he has no flesh. For who shows more <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>? Who is more at variance with them? Who more <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, bitter, and jealous? And since he exhibits all these works, though he has no flesh, how are they works of the flesh, unless because they are the works of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who is, as I said, spoken of under the name of flesh? For it is not by having flesh, which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has not, but by living according to himself&mdash;that is, according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>&mdash;that man became like the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> too, wished to live according to himself when he did not abide in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; so that when he lied, this was not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but of himself, who is not only a liar, but the father of lies, he being the first who lied, and the originator of lying as of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; What It is to Live According to Man, and What to Live According to God.</h2>

<p>When, therefore, man lives according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he is like the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Because not even an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> might live according to an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, but only according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if he was to abide in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and speak God's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and not his own lie. And of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, too, the same apostle says in another place, <q>If the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of God has more abounded through my lie;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120652"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;3:7</a></span> &mdash; <q>my lie,</q> he said, and <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> When, then, a man lives according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he lives not according to himself, but according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for He was God who said, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120653"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> When, therefore, man lives according to himself&mdash;that is, according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;assuredly he lives according to a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>; not that man himself is a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, for God is his author and creator, who is certainly not the author and creator of a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, but because man was made upright, that he might not live according to himself, but according to Him that made him&mdash;in other words, that he might do His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> and not his own; and not to live as he was made to live, that is a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>. For he certainly desires to be blessed even by not living so that he may be blessed. And what is a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> if this desire be not? Wherefore it is not without meaning said that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>. For no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed save by that desire or will by which we desire that it be well with us, and shrink from it being ill with us. That, therefore, is a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> which we do in order that it may be well with us, but which makes us more miserable than we were. And why is this, but because the source of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> lies only in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom he abandons when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and not in himself, by living according to whom he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>?</p>

<p>In enunciating this proposition of ours, then, that because some live according to the flesh and others according to the spirit, there have arisen two diverse and conflicting cities, we might equally well have said, <q>because some live according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, others according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says very plainly to the Corinthians, <q>For whereas there is among you envying and strife, are you not carnal, and walk according to man?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120654"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:3</a></span> So that to walk according to man and to be carnal are the  same; for by <em>flesh</em>, that is, by a part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, man is meant. For before he said that those same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were animal whom afterwards he calls carnal, saying, <q>For what man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, save the spirit of man which is in him? Even so the things of God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no man, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that we might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things which are freely given to us of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> teaches; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the animal man perceives not the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>; for they are foolishness unto him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120655"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:11-14</a></span> It is to men of this kind, then, that is, to animal men, he shortly after says, <q>And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120656"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:1</a></span> And this is to be interpreted by the same usage, a part being taken for the whole. For both the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the flesh, the component parts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, can be used to signify the whole man; and so the animal man and the carnal man are not two different things, but one and the same thing, viz., man living according to man. In the same way it is nothing else than men that are meant either in the words, <q>By the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the law there shall no <em>flesh</em> be justified;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120657"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;3:20</a></span> or in the words, <q>Seventy-five <em><a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a></em> went down into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with Jacob.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120658"><a href="../bible/gen046.htm#verse27">Genesis&nbsp;46:27</a></span> In the one passage, <q>no flesh</q> signifies <q>no man;</q> and in the other, by <q>seventy-five <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a></q> seventy-five men are meant. And the expression, <q>not in words which man's wisdom teaches</q> might equally be <q>not in words which fleshly wisdom teaches;</q> and the expression, <q>ye walk according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</q> might be <q>according to the flesh.</q> And this is still more apparent in the words which followed: <q>For while one says, I am of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and another, I am of Apollos, are you not men?</q> The same thing which he had before expressed by <q>you are animal,</q> you are carnal, he now expresses by <q>you are men;</q> that is, you live according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for if you lived according to Him, you should be gods.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; That the Opinion of the Platonists Regarding the Nature of Body and Soul is Not So Censurable as that of the Manich&aelig;ans, But that Even It is Objectionable, Because It Ascribes the Origin of Vices to the Nature of The Flesh.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;There is no need, therefore, that in our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> we accuse the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the flesh to the injury of the Creator, for in its own kind and degree the flesh is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; but to desert the Creator good, and live according to the created good, is not good, whether a man choose to live according to the flesh, or according to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or according to the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is composed of flesh and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and which is therefore spoken of either by the name flesh alone, or by the name <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone. For he who extols the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as the chief good, and condemns the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the flesh as if it were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, assuredly is fleshly both in his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the flesh; for these his feelings arise from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fancy, not from divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The Platonists, indeed, are not so foolish as, with the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, to detest our present bodies as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> nature;  for they attribute all the elements of which this visible and tangible world is compacted, with all their qualities, to God their Creator. Nevertheless, from the death-infected members and earthly construction of the body they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is so affected, that there are thus originated in it the diseases of desires, and fears, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and sorrow, under which four perturbations, as Cicero  calls them, or <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, as most prefer to name them with the Greeks, is included the whole viciousness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. But if this be so, how is it that &AElig;neas in Virgil, when he had heard from his father in Hades that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> should return to bodies, expresses surprise at this declaration, and exclaims:</p>

<blockquote><p>O father! And can thought conceive

<br>That <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> this realm would leave,

<br>And seek the upper sky,

<br>With sluggish clay to reunite?

<br>This direful longing for the light,

<br>Whence comes it, say, and why? 
</p></blockquote>

<p>This direful longing, then, does it still exist even in that boasted purity of the disembodied spirits, and does it still proceed from the death-infected members and earthly limbs? Does he not assert that, when they begin to long to return to the body, they have already been delivered from all these so-called pestilences of the body? From which we gather that, were this endlessly alternating purification and defilement of departing and returning <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> as it is most certainly false, yet it could not be averred that all culpable and vicious motions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> originate in the earthly body; for, on their own showing, <q>this direful longing,</q> to use the words of their noble exponent, is so extraneous to the  body, that it moves the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is purged of all bodily taint, and is existing apart from any body whatever, and moves it, moreover, to be embodied again. So that even they themselves acknowledge that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not only moved to desire, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, sorrow, by the flesh, but that it can also be agitated with these emotions at its own instance.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; Of the Character of the Human Will Which Makes the Affections of the Soul Right or Wrong.</h2>

<p>But the character of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will is of moment; because, if it is wrong, these motions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will be wrong, but if it is right, they will be not merely blameless, but even praiseworthy. For the will is in them all; yea, none of them is anything else than will. For what are desire and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> but a volition of consent to the things we wish? And what are <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and sadness but a volition of aversion from the things which we do not wish? But when consent takes the form of seeking to possess the things we wish, this is called desire; and when consent takes the form of enjoying the things we wish, this is called <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. In like manner, when we turn with aversion from that which we do not wish to happen, this volition is termed <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; and when we turn away from that which has happened against our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, this act of will is called sorrow. And generally in respect of all that we seek or shun, as a man's will is attracted or repelled, so it is changed and turned into these different affections. Wherefore the man who lives according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, ought to be a lover of good, and therefore a hater of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And since no one is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by nature, but whoever is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, he who lives according to God ought to cherish towards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men a perfect <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, so that he shall neither <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the man because of his <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> because of the man, but <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the man. For the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> being cursed, all that ought to be loved, and nothing that ought to be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, will remain.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; That the Words Love and Regard (Amor and Dilectio) are in Scripture Used Indifferently of Good and Evil Affection.</h2>

<p>He who resolves to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> his neighbor as himself, not according to man but according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is on account of this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> said to be of a good will; and this is in Scripture more commonly called charity, but it is also, even in the same books, called <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For the apostle says that the man to be elected as a ruler of the people must be a lover of good.  And when the Lord Himself had asked Peter, <q>Have you a regard for me (<em>diligis</em>) more than these?</q> Peter replied, <q>Lord, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (<em>amo</em>) You.</q> And again a second time the Lord asked not whether Peter loved (<em>amaret</em>) Him, but whether he had a regard (<em>diligeret</em>)for Him, and, he again answered, <q>Lord, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (<em>amo</em>) You.</q> But on the third interrogation the Lord Himself no longer says, <q>Have you a regard (<em>diligis</em>) for me,</q>but <q>Do you love (<em>amas</em>) me?</q> And then the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> adds, Peter was grieved because He said unto him the third time, <q>Do you love (<em>amas</em>) me?</q> though the Lord had not said three times but only once, <q>Do you love (<em>amas</em>) me?</q> and twice <q> <em>Diligis me</em>?</q> from which we gather that, even when the Lord said <q> <em>diligis</em>,</q> He used an equivalent for <q> <em>amas</em>.</q> Peter, too, throughout used one word for the one thing, and the third time also replied, <q>Lord, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (<em>amo</em>) You.</q> </p>

<p>I have judged it right to mention this, because some are of opinion that charity or regard (<em>dilectio</em>) is one thing, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (<em>amor</em>) another. They say that <em>dilectio</em> is used of a good affection, <em>amor</em> of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. But it is very certain that even secular literature <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no such distinction. However, it is for the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> to determine whether and how they differ, though their own writings sufficiently testify that they make great account of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (<em>amor</em>) placed on good objects, and even on God Himself. But we wished to show that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of our religion, whose authority we prefer to all writings whatsoever, make no distinction between <em>amor</em>, <em>dilectio</em>, and <em> caritas</em>; and we have already shown that <em>amor</em> is used in a good connection. And if any one fancy that <em>amor</em> is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> used both of good and bad loves, but that <em>dilectio</em> is reserved for the good only, let him remember what the psalm says, <q>He that loves (<em>diligit</em>) iniquity <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>;</q>  and the words of the Apostle John, <q>If any man <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (<em>diligere</em>) the world, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (<em>dilectio</em>) of the Father is not in him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120665"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:15</a></span> Here you have in one passage <em>dilectio</em> used both in a good and a bad sense. And if any one demands an instance of <em>amor</em> being used in a bad sense (for we have already shown its use in a good sense), let him read the words, <q>For men shall be lovers (<em>amantes</em>) of their own selves, lovers (<em>amatores</em>) of money.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120666"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:2</a></span> </p> 

<p>The right will is, therefore, well-directed <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and the wrong will is ill-directed <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Love, then, yearning to have what is loved, is desire; and having and enjoying it, is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; fleeing what is opposed to it, it is <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; and feeling what is opposed to it, when it has befallen it, it is sadness. Now these motions are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> if the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; good if the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. What we assert let us prove from Scripture. The apostle <q>desires to depart, and to be with Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120667"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse23">Philippians&nbsp;1:23</a></span> And, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> desired to long for Your judgments;</q>  or if it is more appropriate to say, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> longed to desire Your judgments.</q> And, <q>The desire of wisdom brings to a kingdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120669"><a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse20">Wisdom&nbsp;6:20</a></span> Yet there has always obtained the usage of understanding desire and concupiscence in a bad sense if the object be not defined. But <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is used in a good sense: <q>Be glad in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, you righteous.</q>  And, <q>You have put <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> in my heart.</q>  And, <q>You will fill me with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> with Your countenance.</q>  Fear is used in a good sense by the apostle when he says, <q>Work out your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120673"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse12">Philippians&nbsp;2:12</a></span> And, <q>Be not high-minded, but <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120674"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;11:20</a></span> And, <q>I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120675"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3</a></span> But with respect to sadness, which Cicero prefer to calls sickness (<em>&oelig;gritudo</em>), and Virgil pain (<em>dolor</em>) (as he says, <q> <em>Dolent gaudentque</em></q> ), but which I prefer to call sorrow, because sickness and pain are more commonly used to express bodily suffering&mdash;with respect to this emotion, I say, the question whether it can be used in a good sense is more difficult.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; Of the Three Perturbations, Which the Stoics Admitted in the Soul of the Wise Man to the Exclusion of Grief or Sadness, Which the Manly Mind Ought Not to Experience.</h2>

<p>Those emotions which the Greeks call <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>, and which Cicero calls <em>constanti&oelig;</em>, the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> would restrict to three; and, instead of three <q>perturbations</q> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the wise man, they substituted severally, in place of desire, will; in place of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, contentment; and for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, caution; and as to sickness or pain, which we, to avoid ambiguity, preferred to call sorrow, they denied that it could exist in the mind of a wise man. Will, they say, seeks the good, for this the wise man does. Contentment has its object in good that is possessed, and this the wise man continually possesses. Caution avoids <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and this the wise man ought to avoid. But sorrow arises from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that has already happened; and as they suppose that no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> can happen to the wise man, there can be no representative of sorrow in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. According to them, therefore, none but the wise man wills, is contented, uses caution; and that the fool can do no more than desire, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, be sad. The former three affections Cicero calls <em>constanti&oelig;</em>, the last four <em>perturbationes</em>. Many, however, calls these last <em><a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a></em>; and, as I have said, the Greeks call the former <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>, and the latter <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x1F71;&#x03B8;&#x03B7;</span> . And when I made a careful examination of Scripture to find whether this terminology was sanctioned by it, I came upon this saying of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>There is no contentment to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, says the Lord;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120677"><a href="../bible/isa057.htm#verse21">Isaiah&nbsp;57:21</a></span> as if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> might more properly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> than be contented regarding <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, for contentment is the property of the good and godly. I found also that verse in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120678"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;7:12</a></span> which seems to imply that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or shameful things may be the object of desire, but not of will. Indeed, some interpreters have added <q><a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things,</q> to make the expression more in conformity with customary usage, and have given this meaning, <q>Whatsoever good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that you would that men should do unto you.</q> For they thought that this would prevent any one from wishing other men to provide him with unseemly, not to say shameful gratifications,&mdash; luxurious banquets, for example&mdash;on the supposition that if he returned the like to them he would be fulfilling this precept. In the Greek <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, however, from which the Latin is translated, <q>good</q> does not occur, but only, <q>All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them,</q> and, as I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, because <q>good</q> is already included in the word <q>would;</q> for He does not say <q>desire.</q></p>

<p>Yet though we may sometimes avail ourselves of these precise proprieties of language, we are not to be always bridled by them; and when we read those writers against whose authority it is unlawful to reclaim, we must accept the meanings above mentioned in passages where a right sense can be educed by no other interpretation, as in those instances we adduced partly from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, partly from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> exult with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>? Yet <q>there is no <em> contentment</em> for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, says the Lord.</q>  And how so, unless because contentment, when the word is used in its proper and distinctive significance, means something different from <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>? In like manner, who would deny that it were wrong to enjoin upon men that whatever they desire others to do to them they should themselves do to others, lest they should mutually please one another by shameful and illicit pleasure? And yet the precept, <q>Whatsoever ye <em>would</em> that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them,</q> is very wholesome and just. And how is this, unless because the will is in this place used strictly, and signifies that will which cannot have <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for its object? But ordinary phraseology would not have allowed the saying, <q>Be unwilling to make any manner of lie,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120679"><a href="../bible/sir007.htm#verse13">Sirach&nbsp;7:13</a></span> had there not been also an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will, whose <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> separates if from that which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> celebrated, <q>Peace on earth, of good will to men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120680"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;2:14</a></span> For <q>good</q> is superfluous if there is no other kind of will but good will. And why should the apostle have mentioned it among the praises of charity as a great thing, that <q>it rejoices not in iniquity,</q> unless because <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> does so <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>? For even with secular writers these words are used indifferently. For Cicero, that most fertile of orators, says, <q>I desire, conscript fathers, to be merciful.</q>  And who would be so pedantic as to say that he should have said <q>I will</q> rather than <q>I desire,</q> because the word is used in a good connection? Again, in Terence, the profligate youth, burning with wild <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, says, <q>I will nothing else than Philumena.</q>  That this <q>will</q> was <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is sufficiently indicated by the answer of his old servant which is there introduced: <q>How much better were it to try and banish that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> from your heart, than to speak so as uselessly to inflame your passion still more!</q> And that contentment was used by secular writers in a bad sense that verse of Virgil testifies, in which he most succinctly comprehends these four perturbations,&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>Hence they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and desire, grieve and are content</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>The same author had also used the expression, <q>the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> contentments of the mind.</q>  So that good and bad men alike will, are cautious, and contented; or, to say the same thing in other words, good and bad men alike desire, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, but the former in a good, the latter in a bad fashion, according as the will is right or wrong. Sorrow itself, too, which the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> would not allow to be represented in the mind of the wise man, is used in a good sense, and especially in our writings. For the apostle praises the Corinthians because they had a godly sorrow. But possibly some one may say that the apostle congratulated them because they were penitently sorry, and that such sorrow can exist only in those who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. For these are his words: <q>For I perceive that the same epistle has made you sorry, though it were but for a season. Now I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance; for you were made sorry after a godly manner, that you might receive damage by us in nothing. For godly sorrow works repentance to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> not to be repented of, but the sorrow of the world works death. For, behold, this selfsame thing that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120685"><a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:8-11</a></span> Consequently the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> may defend themselves by replying,  that sorrow is indeed useful for repentance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but that this can have no place in the mind of the wise man, inasmuch as no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> attaches to him of which he could sorrowfully repent, nor any other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> the endurance or experience of which could make him sorrowful. For they say that Alcibiades (if my memory does not deceive me), who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> himself <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, shed tears when Socrates argued with him, and demonstrated that he was miserable because he was foolish. In his case, therefore, folly was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this useful and desirable sorrow, wherewith a man mourns that he is what he ought not to be. But the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> maintain not that the fool, but that the wise man, cannot be sorrowful.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; Of the Perturbations of the Soul Which Appear as Right Affections in the Life of the Righteous.</h2>

<p>But so far as regards this question of mental perturbations, we have answered these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> in the ninth book  of this work, showing that it is rather a verbal than a real dispute, and that they seek contention rather than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Among ourselves, according to the sacred Scriptures and sound doctrine, the citizens of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who live according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the pilgrimage of this life, both <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and desire, and grieve and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. And because their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is rightly placed, all these affections of theirs are right. They <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, they desire <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; they grieve because they themselves groan within themselves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of their body; <span class="stiki" id="note120688"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;8:23</a></span> they <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in hope, because there <q>shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is  swallowed up in victory.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120689"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse54">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:54</a></span> In like manner they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, they desire to persevere; they grieve in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, they <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in good works. They <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because they hear that <q>because iniquity shall abound, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of many shall wax cold.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120690"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;24:12</a></span> They desire to persevere, because they hear that it is written, <q>He that endures to the end shall be saved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120691"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;10:22</a></span> They grieve for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, hearing that <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120692"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> They <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in good works, because they hear that <q>the Lord loves a cheerful giver.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120693"><a href="../bible/2co009.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:7</a></span> In like manner, according as they are strong or weak, they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or desire to be tempted, grieve or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.

<p>And not only on their own account do they experience these emotions, but also on account of those whose deliverance they desire and whose perdition they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and whose loss or <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> affects them with grief or with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.

<p>If these emotions and affections, arising as they do from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and from a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> charity, are to be called <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, then let us allow these emotions which are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> to pass under the name of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. But since these affections, when they are exercised in a becoming way, follow the guidance of right reason, who will dare to say that they are diseases or vicious <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>? Wherefore even the Lord Himself, when He condescended to lead a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life in the form of a slave, had no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatever, and yet exercised these emotions where He judged they should be exercised. For as there was in Him a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body and a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so was there also a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> emotion. When, therefore, we read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that the hard-heartedness of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> moved Him to sorrowful indignation, <span class="stiki" id="note120708"><a href="../bible/mar003.htm#verse5">Mark&nbsp;3:5</a></span> that He said, <q>I am glad for your sakes, to the intent ye may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120709"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;11:15</a></span> that when about to raise Lazarus He even shed tears, <span class="stiki" id="note120710"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;11:35</a></span> that He earnestly desired to eat the passover with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note120711"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse15">Luke&nbsp;22:15</a></span> that as His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> drew near His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was sorrowful, <span class="stiki" id="note120712"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;26:38</a></span> these emotions are certainly not <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to Him. But as He became man when it pleased Him, so, in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of His definite purpose, when it pleased Him He experienced those emotions in His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>But we must further make the admission, that even when these affections are well regulated, and according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, they are peculiar to this life, not to that future life we look for, and that often we yield to them against our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. And thus sometimes we weep in spite of ourselves, being carried beyond ourselves, not indeed by culpable desire; but by praiseworthy charity. In us, therefore, these affections arise from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity; but it was not so with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, for even His infirmity was the consequence of His power. But so long as we wear the infirmity of this life, we are rather worse men  than better if we have none of these emotions at all. For the apostle vituperated and abominated some who, as he said, were <q>without natural affection.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120713"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse31">Romans&nbsp;1:31</a></span> The sacred Psalmist also found fault with those of whom he said, <q>I looked for some to lament with me, and there was none.</q>  For to be quite free from pain while we are in this place of misery is only purchased, as one of this world's literati perceived and remarked,  at the price of blunted sensibilities both of mind and body. And therefore that which the Greeks call <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span>, and what the Latins would call, if their language would allow them, <q> <em>impassibilitas</em>,</q> if it be taken to mean an impassibility of spirit and not of body, or, in other words, a freedom from those emotions which are contrary to reason and disturb the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, then it is obviously a good and most desirable quality, but it is not one which is attainable in this life. For the words of the apostle are the confession, not of the common herd, but of the eminently <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, just, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men: <q>If we say we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120716"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> When there shall be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, then there shall be this <span class="greek">&#x03B1;&#x03C0;&#x1F71;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span> . At present it is enough if we live without crime; and he who thinks he lives without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> puts aside not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but pardon. And if that is to be called apathy, where the mind is the subject of no emotion, then who would not consider this insensibility to be worse than all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>? It may, indeed, reasonably be maintained that the perfect blessedness we hope for shall be free from all sting of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or sadness; but who that is not quite lost to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> would say that neither <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> nor <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> shall be experienced there? But if by apathy a condition be meant in which no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> terrifies nor any pain annoys, we must in this life renounce such a state if we would live according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but may hope to enjoy it in that blessedness which is promised as our <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> condition.</p>

<p>For that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of which the Apostle John says, <q>There is no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; but perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> casts out <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, because <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> has torment. He that fears is not made perfect in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120717"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:18</a></span> &mdash; that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is not of the same kind as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> felt lest the Corinthians should be seduced by the subtlety of the serpent; for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is susceptible of this <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, yea, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> alone is capable of it. But the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> which is not in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is of that kind of which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself says, <q>For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120718"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;8:15</a></span> But as for that <q>clean <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> which endures for ever,</q>  if it is to exist in the world to come (and how else can it be said to endure for ever?), it is not a <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> deterring us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which may happen, but preserving us in the good which cannot be lost. For where the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of acquired good is unchangeable, there certainly the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that avoids <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is, if I may say so, free from anxiety. For under the name of <q>clean <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a></q> David signifies that will by which we shall necessarily shrink from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and guard against it, not with the anxiety of weakness, which fears that we may strongly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but with the tranquillity of perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Or if no kind of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> at all shall exist in that most imperturbable security of perpetual and blissful delights, then the expression, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever,</q> must be taken in the same sense as that other, <q>The patience of the poor shall not perish for ever.</q>  For patience, which is necessary only where ills are to be borne, shall not be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, but that which patience leads us to will be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. So perhaps this <q>clean <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a></q> is said to endure for ever, because that to which <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> leads shall endure.</p>

<p>And since this is so&mdash;since we must live a good life in order to attain to a blessed life, a good life has all these affections right, a bad life has them wrong. But in the blessed life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> there will be <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, not only right, but also assured; but <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and grief there will be none. Whence it already appears in some sort what manner of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> the citizens of the city of God must be in this their pilgrimage, who live after the spirit, not after the flesh&mdash;that is to say, according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>&mdash;and what manner of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> they shall be also in that <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> whither they are journeying. And the city or society of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, who live not according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but according to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and who accept the doctrines of men or devils in the worship of a false and contempt of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> divinity, is shaken with those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> emotions as by diseases and disturbances. And if there be some of its citizens who seem to restrain and, as it were, temper those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, they are so elated with ungodly <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, that their disease is as much greater as their pain is less. And if some, with a vanity monstrous in proportion to its rarity, have become enamored of themselves because they can be stimulated and excited by no emotion, moved or bent by no affection, such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> rather lose all humanity than obtain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> tranquillity. For  a thing is not necessarily right because it is inflexible, nor healthy because it is insensible.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; Whether It is to Be Believed that Our First Parents in Paradise, Before They Sinned, Were Free from All Perturbation.</h2>

<p>But it is a fair question, whether our first parent or first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> (for there was a marriage of two), before they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, experienced in their animal body such emotions as we shall not experience in the spiritual body when <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been purged and finally abolished. For if they did, then how were they <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in that boasted place of bliss, Paradise? For who that is affected by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or grief can be called absolutely blessed? And what could those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or suffer in such affluence of blessings, where neither death nor ill-health was feared, and where nothing was wanting which a good will could desire, and nothing present which could interrupt man's mental or bodily enjoyment? Their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to God was unclouded, and their mutual affection was that of faithful and sincere marriage; and from this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> flowed a wonderful delight, because they always enjoyed what was loved. Their avoidance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was tranquil; and, so long as it was maintained, no other ill at all could invade them and bring sorrow. Or did they perhaps desire to touch and eat the forbidden fruit, yet feared to die; and thus both <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and desire already, even in that blissful place, preyed upon those first of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>? Away with the thought that such could be the case where there was no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>! And, indeed, this is already <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to desire those things which the law of God forbids, and to abstain from them through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment, not through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of righteousness. Away, I say, with the thought, that before there was any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there should already have been committed regarding that fruit the very <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which our Lord warns us against regarding a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: <q>Whosoever looks on a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after her, has committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with her already in his heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120721"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;5:28</a></span> As <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, then, as were these our first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, who were agitated by no mental perturbations, and annoyed by no bodily discomforts, so <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> should the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> have been, had they not introduced that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which they have transmitted to their posterity, and had none of their descendants committed iniquity worthy of damnation; but this original blessedness continuing until, in virtue of that benediction which said, <q>Increase and multiply,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120722"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> the number of the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> should have been completed, there would then have been bestowed that higher felicity which is enjoyed by the most blessed <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>&mdash;a blessedness in which there should have been a secure assurance that no one would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and no one die; and so should the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have lived, after no taste of labor, pain, or death, as now they shall live in the resurrection, after they have endured all these things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; Of the Fall of the First Man, in Whom Nature Was Created Good, and Can Be Restored Only by Its Author.</h2>

<p>But because God foresaw all things, and was therefore not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that man also would fall, we ought to consider this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city in connection with what God foresaw and ordained, and not according to our own ideas, which do not embrace God's ordination. For man, by his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, could not disturb the divine counsel, nor compel God to change what He had decreed; for God's foreknowledge had anticipated both&mdash;that is to say, both how <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> the man whom He had created good should become, and what good He Himself should even thus derive from him. For though God is said to change His determinations (so that in a tropical sense the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> says even that God repented ), this is said with reference to man's expectation, or the order of natural causes, and not with reference to that which the Almighty had foreknown that He would do. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as it is written, made man upright, <span class="stiki" id="note120724"><a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse29">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;7:29</a></span> and consequently with a good will. For if he had not had a good will, he could not have been upright. The good will, then, is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for God created him with it. But the first <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will, which preceded all man's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> acts, was rather a kind of falling away from the work of God to its own works than any positive work. And therefore the acts resulting were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not having <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the will itself for their end; so that the will or the man himself, so far as his will is bad, was as it were the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tree bringing forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit. Moreover, the bad will, though it be not in harmony with, but opposed to nature, inasmuch as it is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> or blemish, yet it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of it as of all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, that it cannot exist except in a nature, and only in a nature created out of nothing, and not in that which the Creator has begotten of Himself, as He begot the Word, by whom all things were made. For though God formed man of the dust of the earth, yet the earth itself, and every earthly material, is absolutely created out of nothing; and man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, too, God created out of  nothing, and joined to the body, when He made man. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are so thoroughly overcome by good, that though they are permitted to exist, for the sake of demonstrating how the most righteous foresight of God can make a good use even of them, yet good can exist without <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, as in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and supreme God Himself, and as in every invisible and visible celestial creature that exists above this murky atmosphere; but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> cannot exist without good, because the natures in which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> exists, in so far as they are natures, are good. And <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is removed, not by removing any nature, or part of a nature, which had been introduced by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but by healing and correcting that which had been vitiated and depraved. The will, therefore, is then <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> free, when it is not the slave of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Such was it given us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this being lost by its own fault, can only be restored by Him who was able at first to give it. And therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> says, <q>If the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120725"><!--k28--<a href="../bible/1jo008.htm#verse36">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;8:36</a></span> which is equivalent to saying, If the Son shall save you, you shall be saved indeed. For He is our Liberator, inasmuch as He is our Saviour.</p>

<p>Man then lived with God for his rule in a paradise at once physical and spiritual. For neither was it a paradise only physical for the advantage of the body, and not also spiritual for the advantage of the mind; nor was it only spiritual to afford enjoyment to man by his internal sensations, and not also physical to afford him enjoyment through his external senses. But obviously it was both for both ends. But after that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and therefore <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> (of whose fall I have said as much as I was able in the eleventh and twelfth books of this work, as well as that of his fellows, who, from being God's <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, became his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>), preferring to rule with a kind of pomp of empire rather than to be another's subject, fell from the spiritual Paradise, and essaying to insinuate his persuasive guile into the mind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whose unfallen condition provoked him to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> now that himself was fallen, he chose the serpent as his mouthpiece in that bodily Paradise in which it and all the other earthly animals were living with those two <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, the man and his wife, subject to them, and harmless; and he chose the serpent because, being slippery, and moving in tortuous windings, it was suitable for his purpose. And this animal being subdued to his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> ends by the presence and superior force of his angelic nature, he abused as his instrument, and first tried his deceit upon the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, making his assault upon the weaker part of that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> alliance, that he might gradually gain the whole, and not supposing that the man would readily give ear to him, or be deceived, but that he might yield to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. For as <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> was not induced to agree with the people when they blindly wished him to make an idol, and yet yielded to constraint; and as it is not credible that Solomon was so blind as to suppose that <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> should be worshipped, but was drawn over to such sacrilege by the blandishments of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; so we cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was deceived, and supposed the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> word to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and therefore transgressed God's law, but that he by the drawings of kindred yielded to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, the husband to the wife, the one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being to the only other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being. For not without significance did the apostle say, <q>And <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was not deceived, but the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> being deceived was in the transgression;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120726"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:14</a></span> but he speaks thus, because the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> accepted as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> what the serpent told her, but the man could not bear to be severed from his only companion, even though this involved a partnership in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. He was not on this account less culpable, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> with his eyes open. And so the apostle does not say, <q>He did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> but <q>He was not deceived.</q> For he shows that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> when he says, <q>By one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120727"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span> and immediately after more distinctly, <q>In the likeness of Adam's transgression.</q> But he meant that those are deceived who do not judge that which they do to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. Otherwise how were it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <q>Adam was not deceived?</q> But having as yet no experience of the divine severity, he was possibly deceived in so far as he thought his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> venial. And consequently he was not deceived as the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was deceived, but he was deceived as to the judgment which would be passed on his apology: <q>The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom you gave to be with me, she gave me, and I did eat.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120728"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse12">Genesis&nbsp;3:12</a></span> What need of saying more? Although they were not both deceived by credulity, yet both were entangled in the snares of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and taken by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; Of the Nature of Man's First Sin.</h2>

<p>If any one finds a difficulty in understanding why other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not alter <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as it was altered by the transgression of those first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, so that on account of it this nature is subject to the great corruption  we feel and see, and to death, and is distracted and tossed with so many <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> and contending emotions, and is certainly far different from what it was before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even though it were then lodged in an animal body&mdash;if, I say, any one is moved by this, he ought not to think that that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was a small and light one because it was committed about food, and that not bad nor noxious, except because it was forbidden; for in that spot of singular felicity God could not have created and planted any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing. But by the precept He gave, God commended <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, which is, in a sort, the mother and guardian of all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the reasonable creature, which was so created that submission is advantageous to it, while the fulfillment of its own will in preference to the Creator's is destruction. And as this commandment enjoining abstinence from one kind of food in the midst of great abundance of other kinds was so easy to keep&mdash;so light a burden to the memory,&mdash; and, above all, found no resistance to its observance in <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, which only afterwards sprung up as the penal consequence of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the iniquity of violating it was all the greater in proportion to the ease with which it might have been kept.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; That in Adam's Sin an Evil Will Preceded the Evil Act.</h2>

<p>Our first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> fell into open disobedience because already they were secretly corrupted; for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> act had never been done had not an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will preceded it. And what is the origin of our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will but <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>? For <q><a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120729"><a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse13">Sirach&nbsp;10:13</a></span> And what is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> but the craving for undue exaltation? And this is undue exaltation, when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> abandons Him to whom it ought to cleave as its end, and becomes a kind of end to itself. This happens when it becomes its own satisfaction. And it does so when it falls away from that unchangeable good which ought to satisfy it more than itself. This falling away is spontaneous; for if the will had remained steadfast in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of that higher and changeless good by which it was illumined to intelligence and kindled into <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, it would not have turned away to find satisfaction in itself, and so become frigid and benighted; the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> would not have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the serpent spoke the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, nor would the man have preferred the request of his wife to the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor have supposed that it was a venial trangression to cleave to the partner of his life even in a partnership of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> deed, then&mdash;that is to say, the trangression of eating the forbidden fruit&mdash;was committed by <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who were already <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. That <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120730"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;7:18</a></span> could be brought forth only by <q>a corrupt tree.</q> But that the tree was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was not the result of nature; for certainly it could become so only by the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of the will, and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is contrary to nature. Now, nature could not have been depraved by <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> had it not been made out of nothing. Consequently, that it is a nature, this is because it is made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but that it falls away from Him, this is because it is made out of nothing. But man did not so fall away  as to become absolutely nothing; but being turned towards himself, his being became more contracted than it was when he clave to Him who supremely is. Accordingly, to exist in himself, that is, to be his own satisfaction after abandoning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is not quite to become a nonentity, but to approximate to that. And therefore the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> designate the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> by another name, <q>self-pleasers.</q> For it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to have the heart lifted up, yet not to one's self, for this is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, but to the Lord, for this is <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>, and can be the act only of the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>. There is, therefore, something in humility which, strangely enough, exalts the heart, and something in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> which debases it. This seems, indeed, to be contradictory, that loftiness should debase and lowliness exalt. But <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> humility enables us to submit to what is above us; and nothing is more exalted above us than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and therefore humility, by making us subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, exalts us. But <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, being a defect of nature, by the very act of refusing subjection and revolting from Him who is supreme, falls to a low condition; and then comes to pass what is written: <q>You cast them down when they lifted up themselves.</q>  For he does not say, <q>when they had been lifted up,</q> as if first they were exalted, and then afterwards cast down; but <q>when they lifted up themselves</q> even then they were cast down&mdash;that is to say, the very lifting up was already a fall. And therefore it is that humility is specially recommended to the city of God as it sojourns in this world, and is specially exhibited in the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the person of Christ its King; while the contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, according to the testimony of the sacred writings, specially rules his adversary the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. And certainly this is the great difference which distinguishes the two cities of which we speak, the one being the society of the godly men, the other of the ungodly, each associated with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that adhere to their party, and the one guided and fashioned by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of self, the other by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p> 

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, then, would not have ensnared man in the open and manifest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of doing what God had forbidden, had man not already begun to live for himself. It was this that made him listen with pleasure to the words, <q>You shall be as gods,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120733"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse5">Genesis&nbsp;3:5</a></span> which they would much more readily have accomplished by obediently adhering to their supreme and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> end than by proudly living to themselves. For created gods are gods not by virtue of what is in themselves, but by a participation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. By craving to be more, man becomes less; and by aspiring to be self-sufficing, he fell away from Him who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> suffices him. Accordingly, this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> desire which prompts man to please himself as if he were himself light, and which thus turns him away from that light by which, had he followed it, he would himself have become light&mdash;this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> desire, I say, already secretly <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in him, and the open <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was but its consequence. For that is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which is written, <q>Pride goes before destruction, and before <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is humility;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120734"><a href="../bible/pro018.htm#verse12">Proverbs&nbsp;18:12</a></span> that is to say, secret ruin precedes open ruin, while the former is not counted ruin. For who counts exaltation ruin, though no sooner is the Highest forsaken than a fall is begun? But who does not recognize it as ruin, when there occurs an evident and indubitable transgression of the commandment? And consequently, God's prohibition had reference to such an act as, when committed, could not be defended on any pretense of doing what was righteous.  And I make bold to say that it is useful for the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> to fall into an open and indisputable transgression, and so displease themselves, as already, by pleasing themselves, they had fallen. For Peter was in a healthier condition when he wept and was dissatisfied with himself, than when he boldly presumed and satisfied himself. And this is averred by the sacred Psalmist when he says, <q>Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek Your name, O Lord;</q>  that is, that they who have pleased themselves in seeking their own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> may be pleased and satisfied with You in seeking Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; Of the Pride in the Sin, Which Was Worse Than the Sin Itself.</h2>

<p>But it is a worse and more damnable <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> which casts about for the shelter of an excuse even in manifest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as these our first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> did, of whom the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said, <q>The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat;</q> and the man said, <q>The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120737"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse12">Genesis&nbsp;3:12-13</a></span> Here there is no word of begging pardon, no word of entreaty for healing. For though they do not, like Cain, deny that they have perpetrated the deed, yet their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> seeks to refer its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> to another&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to the serpent, the man's to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. But where there is a plain trangression of a divine commandment, this is rather to accuse than to excuse oneself. For the fact that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> on the serpent's persuasion, and the man at the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> offer, did not make the transgression less, as if there were any one whom we ought rather to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> or yield to than God.</p>

<p>Therefore, because the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was a despising of the authority of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;who had created man; who had made him in His own image; who had set him above the other animals; who had placed him in Paradise; who had enriched him with abundance of every kind and of safety; who had laid upon him neither many, nor great, nor difficult commandments, but, in order to make a wholesome <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> easy to him, had given him a single very brief and very light precept by which He reminded that creature whose service was to be free that He was Lord,&mdash; it was just that condemnation followed, and condemnation such that man, who by keeping the commandments should have been spiritual even in his flesh, became fleshly even in his spirit; and as in his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> he had sought to be his own satisfaction, God in His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> abandoned him to himself, not to live in the absolute independence he affected, but instead of the liberty he desired, to live dissatisfied with himself in a hard and miserable bondage to him to whom by sinning he had yielded himself, doomed in spite of himself to die in body as he had willingly become dead in spirit, condemned even to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death (had not the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God delivered him) because he had forsaken <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Whoever thinks such punishment either excessive or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> shows his inability to measure the great iniquity of sinning where <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might so easily have been avoided. For as <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> is with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> pronounced to be great, because the thing commanded, to kill his son, was very difficult, so in Paradise the disobedience was the greater, because the difficulty of that which was commanded was imperceptible. And as the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of the second Man was  the more laudable because He became <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> even <q>unto death,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120738"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> so the disobedience of the first man was the more detestable because he became disobedient even unto death. For where the penalty annexed to disobedience is great, and the thing commanded by the Creator is easy, who can sufficiently estimate how great a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> it is, in a matter so easy, not to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the authority of so great a power, even when that power deters with so terrible a penalty?</p>

<p>In short, to say all in a word, what but disobedience was the punishment of disobedience in that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? For what else is man's misery but his own disobedience to himself, so that in consequence of his not being willing to do what he could do, he now wills to do what he cannot? For though he could not do all things in Paradise before he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, yet he wished to do only what he could do, and therefore he could do all things he wished. But now, as we recognize in his offspring, and as <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> testifies, <q>Man is like to vanity.</q>  For who can count how many things he wishes which he cannot do, so long as he is disobedient to himself, that is, so long as his mind and his flesh do not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> his will? For in spite of himself his mind is both frequently disturbed, and his flesh suffers, and grows old, and dies; and in spite of ourselves we suffer whatever else we suffer, and which we would not suffer if our nature absolutely and in all its parts <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But is it not the infirmities of the flesh which hamper it in its service? Yet what does it matter <em>how</em> its service is hampered, so long as the fact remains, that by the just retribution of the sovereign God whom we refused to be subject to and serve, our flesh, which was subjected to us, now torments us by insubordination, although our disobedience brought trouble on ourselves, not upon God? For He is not in need of our service as we of our body's; and therefore what we did was no punishment to Him, but what we receive is so to us. And the pains which are called bodily are pains of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in and from the body. For what pain or desire can the flesh feel by itself and without the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? But when the flesh is said to desire or to suffer, it is meant, as we have explained, that the man does so, or some part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is affected by the sensation of the flesh, whether a harsh sensation causing pain, or gentle, causing pleasure. But pain in the flesh is only a discomfort of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> arising from the flesh, and a kind of shrinking from its suffering, as the pain of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is called sadness is a shrinking from those things which have happened to us in spite of ourselves. But sadness is frequently preceded by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, which is itself in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not in the flesh; while bodily pain is not preceded by any kind of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the flesh, which can be felt in the flesh before the pain. But pleasure is preceded by a certain appetite which is felt in the flesh like a craving, as hunger and thirst and that generative appetite which is most commonly identified with the name <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, though this is the generic word for all desires. For <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> itself was defined by the ancients as nothing else than the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of revenge;  although sometimes a man is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> even at inanimate objects which cannot feel his vengeance, as when one breaks a pen, or crushes a quill that writes badly. Yet even this, though less reasonable, is in its way a <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of revenge, and is, so to speak, a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> kind of shadow of [the great law of] retribution, that they who do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should suffer <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. There is therefore a <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> for revenge, which is called <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; there is a <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of money, which goes by the name of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>; there is a <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of conquering, no matter by what means, which is called opinionativeness; there is a <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of applause, which is named boasting. There are many and various <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, of which some have names of their own, while others have not. For who could readily give a name to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of ruling, which yet has a powerful influence in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of tyrants, as civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; Of the Evil of Lust&mdash;A Word Which, Though Applicable to Many Vices, is Specially Appropriated to Sexual Uncleanness.</h2>

<p>Although, therefore, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> may have many objects, yet when no object is specified, the word <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> usually suggests to the mind the lustful excitement of the organs of generation. And this <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> not only takes possession of the whole body and outward members, but also makes itself felt within, and moves the whole man with a passion in which mental emotion is mingled with bodily appetite, so that the pleasure which results is the greatest of all bodily pleasures. So possessing indeed is this pleasure, that at the moment of time in which it is consummated, all mental activity is suspended. What friend of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> joys, who, being married, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, as the apostle says, <q>how to possess his vessel in santification and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, not in the disease of desire, as the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120741"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:4</a></span> would not prefer, if this were possible , to beget children without this <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, so that in this function of begetting offspring the members created for this purpose should not be stimulated by the heat of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, but should be actuated by his volition, in the same way as his other members serve him for their respective ends? But even those who delight in this pleasure are not moved to it at their own will, whether they confine themselves to lawful or transgress to unlawful pleasures; but sometimes this <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> importunes them in spite of themselves, and sometimes fails them when they desire to feel it, so that though <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> rages in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, it stirs not in the body. Thus, strangely enough, this emotion not only fails to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the legitimate desire to beget offspring, but also refuses to serve lascivious <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; and though it often opposes its whole combined energy to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that resists it, sometimes also it is divided against itself, and while it moves the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, leaves the body unmoved.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.&mdash; Of the Nakedness of Our First Parents, Which They Saw After Their Base and Shameful Sin.</h2>

<p>Justly is shame very specially connected with this <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, too, these members themselves, being moved and restrained not at our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but by a certain independent autocracy, so to speak, are called <q>shameful.</q> Their condition was different before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For as it is written, <q>They were naked and were not ashamed,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120742"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse25">Genesis&nbsp;2:25</a></span> &mdash; not that their nakedness was unknown to them, but because nakedness was not yet shameful, because not yet did <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> move those members without the will's consent; not yet did the flesh by its disobedience testify against the disobedience of man. For they were not created blind, as the unenlightened vulgar fancy;  for <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> saw the animals to whom he gave names, and of Eve we read, <q>The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> saw that the tree was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120744"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;3:6</a></span> Their eyes, therefore were open, but were not open to this, that is to say, were not observant so as to recognize what was conferred upon them by the garment of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for they had no consciousness of their members warring against their will. But when they were stripped of this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,  that their disobedience might be punished by fit retribution, there began in the movement of their bodily members a shameless novelty which made nakedness indecent: it at once made them observant and made them ashamed. And therefore, after they violated God's command by open transgression, it is written: <q>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120746"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;3:7</a></span> <q>The eyes of them both were opened,</q> not to see, for already they saw, but to discern between the good they had lost and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> into which they had fallen. And therefore also the tree itself which they were forbidden to touch was called the tree of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from this circumstance, that if they ate of it it would impart to them this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For the discomfort of sickness reveals the pleasure of health. <q>They <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>,</q> therefore, <q>that they were naked,</q>&mdash; naked of that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which prevented them from being ashamed of bodily nakedness while the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> offered no resistance to their mind. And thus they obtained a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which they would have lived in blissful <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of, had they, in trustful <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, declined to commit that offense which involved them in the experience of the hurtful effects of unfaithfulness and disobedience. And therefore, being ashamed of the disobedience of their own flesh, which witnessed to their disobedience while it punished it, <q>they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons,</q> that is, cinctures for their privy parts; for some interpreters have rendered the word by <em>succinctoria</em>. <em>Campestria</em> is, indeed, a Latin word, but it is used of the drawers or aprons used for a similar purpose by the young men who stripped for exercise in the <em>campus</em>; hence those who were so girt were commonly called <em> campestrati</em>. Shame modestly covered that which <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> disobediently moved in opposition to the will, which was thus punished for its own disobedience. Consequently all nations, being propagated from that one stock, have so strong an instinct to cover the shameful parts, that some barbarians do not uncover them even in the bath, but wash with their drawers on. In the dark solitudes of India also, though some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> go naked, and are therefore called gymnosophists, yet they make an exception in the case of these members and cover them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; Of the Shame Which Attends All Sexual Intercourse.</h2>

<p>Lust requires for its consummation darkness and secrecy; and this not only when un  lawful intercourse is desired, but even such fornication as the earthly city has legalized. Where there is no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment, these permitted pleasures still shrink from the public eye. Even where provision is made for this <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, secrecy also is provided; and while <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> found it easy to remove the prohibitions of law, shamelessness found it impossible to lay aside the veil of retirement. For even shameless men call this shameful; and though they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the pleasure, dare not display it. What! Does not even conjugal intercourse, sanctioned as it is by law for the propagation of children, legitimate and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> though it be, does it not seek retirement from every eye? Before the bridegroom fondles his bride, does he not exclude the attendants, and even the paranymphs, and such friends as the closest ties have admitted to the bridal chamber? The greatest master of Roman eloquence says, that all right actions wish to be set in the light, <em>i.e</em>., desire to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. This right action, however, has such a desire to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, that yet it blushes to be seen. Who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what passes between husband and wife that children may be born? Is it not for this purpose that wives are married with such ceremony? And yet, when this well-understood act is gone about for the procreation of children, not even the children themselves, who may already have been born to them, are suffered to be witnesses. This right action seeks the light, in so far as it seeks to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but yet dreads being seen. And why so, if not because that which is by nature fitting and decent is so done as to be accompanied with a shame-begetting penalty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; That It is Now Necessary, as It Was Not Before Man Sinned, to Bridle Anger and Lust by the Restraining Influence of Wisdom.</h2>

<p>Hence it is that even the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who have approximated to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> have avowed that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> are vicious mental emotions, because, even when exercised towards objects which wisdom does not prohibit, they are moved in an ungoverned and inordinate manner, and consequently need the regulation of mind and reason. And they assert that this third part of the mind is posted as it were in a kind of citadel, to give rule to these other parts, so that, while it rules and they serve, man's righteousness is preserved without a breach.  These parts, then, which they acknowledge to be vicious even in a wise and temperate man, so that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, by its composing and restraining influence, must bridle and recall them from those objects towards which they are unlawfully moved, and give them access to those which the law of wisdom sanctions,&mdash; that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, <em>e.g</em>., may be allowed for the enforcement of a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> authority, and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> for the duty of propagating offspring&mdash;these parts, I say, were not vicious in Paradise before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for they were never moved in opposition to a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> will towards any object from which it was necessary that they should be withheld by the restraining bridle of reason. For though now they are moved in this way, and are regulated by a bridling and restraining power, which those who live temperately, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, and godly exercise, sometimes with ease, and sometimes with greater difficulty, this is not the sound health of nature, but the weakness which results from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And how is it that shame does not hide the acts and words dictated by <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or other emotions, as it covers the motions of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, unless because the members of the body which we employ for accomplishing them are moved, not by the emotions themselves, but by the authority of the consenting will? For he who in his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> rails at or even strikes some one, could not do so were not his tongue and hand moved by the authority of the will, as also they are moved when there is no <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. But the organs of generation are so subjected to the rule of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, that they have no motion but what it communicates. It is this we are ashamed of; it is this which blushingly hides from the eyes of onlookers. And rather will a man endure a crowd of witnesses when he is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> venting his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> on some one, than the eye of one man when he innocently copulates with his wife.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; Of the Foolish Beastliness of the Cynics.</h2>

<p>It is this which those canine or cynic  <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have overlooked, when they have, in violation of the modest instincts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, boastfully proclaimed their unclean and shameless opinion, worthy indeed of dogs, viz., that as the matrimonial act is legitimate, no one should be ashamed to perform it openly, in the street or in any public place. Instinctive shame has overborne this wild fancy. For though it is related  that Diogenes once dared to put his opinion in practice, under the impression that his <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> would be all the more famous if his egregious shamelessness were deeply graven in the memory of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, yet this example was not afterwards followed.  Shame had more influence with them, to make them blush before men, than <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to make them affect a resemblance to dogs. And possibly, even in the case of Diogenes, and those who did imitate him, there was but an appearance and pretence of copulation, and not the reality. Even at this day there are still Cynic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> to be seen; for these are <a href="../cathen/04582a.htm">Cynics</a> who are not content with being clad in the <em> <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a></em>, but also carry a club; yet no one of them dares to do this that we speak of. If they did, they would be spat upon, not to say <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, by the mob. Human nature, then, is without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> ashamed of this <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> so, for the insubordination of these members, and their defiance of the will, are the clear testimony of the punishment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And it was fitting that this should appear specially in those parts by which is generated that nature which has been altered for the worse by that first and great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash;that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from whose <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> connection no one can escape, unless God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> expiate in him individually that which was perpetrated to the destruction of all in common, when all were in one man, and which was avenged by God's <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.&mdash; That Man's Transgression Did Not Annul the Blessing of Fecundity Pronounced Upon Man Before He Sinned But Infected It with the Disease of Lust.</h2>

<p>Far be it, then, from us to suppose that our first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in Paradise felt that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> which caused them afterwards to blush and hide their nakedness, or that by its means they should have fulfilled the benediction of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>Increase and multiply and replenish the earth;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120750"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> for it was after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> began. It was after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that our nature, having lost the power it had over the whole body, but not having lost all shame, perceived, noticed, blushed at, and covered it. But that blessing upon marriage, which encouraged them to increase and multiply and replenish the earth, though it continued even after they had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, was yet given before they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, in order that the procreation of children might be recognized as part of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of marriage, and not of the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But now, men being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the blessedness of Paradise, suppose that children could not have been begotten there in any other way than they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them to be begotten now, <em>i.e</em>., by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, at which even <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> marriage blushes; some not simply rejecting, but sceptically deriding the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, in which we read that our first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, after they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, were ashamed of their nakedness, and covered it; while others, though they accept and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> Scripture, yet conceive that this expression, <q>Increase and multiply,</q> refers not to carnal fecundity, because a similar expression is used of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the words, <q>You will multiply me with strength in my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>;</q>  and so, too, in the words which follow in Genesis, <q>And replenish the earth, and subdue it,</q> they understand by the earth the body which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> fills with its presence, and which it rules over when it is multiplied in strength. And they hold that children could no more then than now be begotten without <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, which, after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, was kindled, observed, blushed for, and covered; and even that children would not have been born in Paradise, but only outside of it, as in fact it turned out. For it was after they were expelled from it that they came together to beget children, and begot them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; Of the Conjugal Union as It Was Originally Instituted and Blessed by God.</h2>

<p>But we, for our part, have no manner of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that to increase and multiply and replenish the earth in virtue of the blessing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is a gift of marriage as God instituted it from the beginning before man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, when He created them male and female,&mdash; in other words, two sexes manifestly distinct. And it was this work of God on which His blessing was pronounced. For no sooner had Scripture said, <q>Male and female created He them,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120752"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse27">Genesis&nbsp;1:27-28</a></span> than it immediately continues, <q>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Increase, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it,</q> etc. And though all these things may not unsuitably be interpreted in a spiritual sense, yet <q>male and female</q> cannot be understood of two things in one man, as if there were in him one thing which rules, another which is ruled; but it is quite clear that they were created male and female, with bodies of different sexes, for the very purpose of begetting offspring, and so increasing, multiplying, and replenishing the earth; and it is great folly to oppose so plain a fact. It was not of the spirit which commands and the body which obeys, nor of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which rules and the irrational desire which is ruled, nor of the contemplative <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is supreme and the active which is subject, nor of the understanding of the mind and the sense of the body, but plainly of the matrimonial union by which the sexes are mutually bound together, that our Lord, when asked whether  it were lawful for any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to put away one's wife (for on account of the hardness of the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> permitted a bill of divorcement to be given), answered and said, <q>Have ye not read that He which made them at the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more two, but one flesh. What, therefore, God has joined together, let not man put asunder.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120753"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;19:4-5</a></span> It is certain, then, that from the first men were created, as we see and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them to be now, of two sexes, male and female, and that they are called one, either on account of the matrimonial union, or on account of the origin of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who was created from the side of the man. And it is by this original example, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself instituted, that the apostle admonishes all husbands to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their own wives in particular. <span class="stiki" id="note120754"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse25">Ephesians&nbsp;5:25</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 23.&mdash; Whether Generation Should Have Taken Place Even in Paradise Had Man Not Sinned, or Whether There Should Have Been Any Contention There Between Chastity and Lust.</h2>

<p>But he who says that there should have been neither copulation nor generation but for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, virtually says that man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was necessary to complete the number of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. For if these two by not sinning should have continued to live alone, because, as is supposed, they could not have begotten children had they not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, then certainly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was necessary in order that there might be not only two but many righteous men. And if this cannot be maintained without absurdity, we must rather <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the number of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> fit to complete this most blessed city would have been as great though no one had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, as it is now that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God gathers its citizens out of the multitude of sinners, so long as the children of this world generate and are generated. <span class="stiki" id="note120755"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;20:34</a></span> </p>

<p>And therefore that marriage, worthy of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of Paradise, should have had desirable fruit without the shame of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, had there been no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But how that could be, there is now no example to teach us. Nevertheless, it ought not to seem incredible that one member might serve the will without <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> then, since so many serve it now. Do we now move our feet and hands when we will to do the things we would by means of these members? Do we meet with no resistance in them, but perceive that they are ready servants of the will, both in our own case and in that of others, and especially of artisans employed in mechanical operations, by which the weakness and clumsiness of nature become, through industrious exercise, wonderfully dexterous? And shall we not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, like as all those members obediently serve the will, so also should the members have discharged the function of generation, though <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, the award of disobedience, had been awanting? Did not Cicero, in discussing the difference of governments in his <em>De Republica</em>, adopt a simile from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and say that we command our bodily members as children, they are so <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>; but that the vicious parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must be treated as slaves, and be coerced with a more stringent authority? And no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, in the order of nature, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more excellent than the body; and yet the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> commands the body more easily than itself. Nevertheless this <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, of which we at present speak, is the more shameful on this account, because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is therein neither master of itself, so as not to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> at all, nor of the body, so as to keep the members under the control of the will; for if they were thus ruled, there should be no shame. But now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is ashamed that the body, which by nature is inferior and subject to it, should resist its authority. For in the resistance experienced by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the other emotions there is less shame, because the resistance is from itself, and thus, when it is conquered by itself, itself is the conqueror, although the conquest is inordinate and vicious, because accomplished by those parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which ought to be subject to reason, yet, being accomplished by its own parts and energies, the conquest is, as I say, its own. For when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> conquers itself to a due subordination, so that its unreasonable motions are controlled by reason, while it again is subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this is a conquest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and praiseworthy. Yet there is less shame when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is resisted by its own vicious parts than when its will and order are resisted by the body, which is distinct from and inferior to it, and dependent on it for life itself.</p>

<p>But so long as the will retains under its authority the other members, without which the members excited by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> to resist the will cannot accomplish what they seek, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is preserved, and the delight of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> foregone. And certainly, had not culpable disobedience been visited with penal disobedience, the marriage of Paradise should have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this struggle and rebellion, this quarrel between will and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, that the will may be satisfied and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> restrained, but those members,  like all the rest, should have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the will. The field of generation  should have been sown by the organ created for this purpose, as the earth is sown by the hand. And whereas now, as we essay to investigate this subject more exactly, modesty hinders us, and compels us to ask pardon of chaste ears, there would have been no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to do so, but we could have discoursed freely, and without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of seeming obscene, upon all those points which occur to one who meditates on the subject. There would not have been even words which could be called obscene, but all that might be said of these members would have been as pure as what is said of the other parts of the body. Whoever, then, comes to the perusal of these pages with unchaste <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, let him blame his disposition, not his nature; let him brand the actings of his own impurity, not the words which necessity forces us to use, and for which every pure and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> reader or hearer will very readily pardon me, while I expose the folly of that scepticism which argues solely on the ground of its own experience, and has no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in anything beyond. He who is not scandalized at the apostle's censure of the horrible <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who <q>changed the natural use into that which is against nature,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120757"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse26">Romans&nbsp;1:26</a></span> will read all this without being shocked, especially as we are not, like <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, citing and censuring a damnable uncleanness, but are explaining, so far as we can, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generation, while with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> we avoid all obscenity of language.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.&mdash; That If Men Had Remained Innocent and Obedient in Paradise, the Generative Organs Should Have Been in Subjection to the Will as the Other Members are.</h2>

<p>The man, then, would have sown the seed, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> received it, as need required, the generative organs being moved by the will, not excited by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. For we move at will not only those members which are furnished with joints of solid bone, as the hands, feet, and fingers, but we move also at will those which are composed of slack and soft nerves: we can put them in motion, or stretch them out, or bend and twist them, or contract and stiffen them, as we do with the muscles of the mouth and face. The lungs, which are the very tenderest of the viscera except the brain, and are therefore carefully sheltered in the cavity of the chest, yet for all purposes of inhaling and exhaling the breath, and of uttering and modulating the voice, are <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the will when we breathe, exhale, speak, shout, or sing, just as the bellows <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the smith or the organist. I will not press the fact that some animals have a natural power to move a single spot of the skin with which their whole body is covered, if they have felt on it anything they wish to drive off&mdash;a power so great, that by this shivering tremor of the skin they can not only shake off flies that have settled on them, but even spears that have fixed in their flesh. Man, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, has not this power; but is this any reason for supposing that God could not give it to such creatures as He wished to possess it? And therefore man himself also might very well have enjoyed absolute power over his members had he not forfeited it by his disobedience; for it was not difficult for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to form him so that what is now moved in his body only by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> should have been moved only at will.</p>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, too, that some men are differently constituted from others, and have some rare and remarkable faculty of doing with their body what other men can by no effort do, and, indeed, scarcely <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> when they hear of others doing. There are <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who can move their ears, either one at a time, or both together. There are some who, without moving the head, can bring the hair down upon the forehead, and move the whole scalp backwards and forwards at pleasure. Some, by lightly pressing their stomach, bring up an incredible quantity and variety of things they have swallowed, and produce whatever they please, quite whole, as if out of a bag. Some so accurately mimic the voices of birds and beasts and other men, that, unless they are seen, the difference cannot be told. Some have such command of their bowels, that they can break wind continuously at pleasure, so as to produce the effect of singing. I myself have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> a man who was accustomed to sweat whenever he wished. It is well known that some weep when they please, and shed a flood of tears. But far more incredible is that which some of our brethren saw quite recently. There was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> called Restitutus, in the parish of the Calamensian  Church, who, as often as he pleased (and he was asked to do this by those who desired to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> so remarkable a phenomenon), on some one imitating the wailings of mourners, became so insensible, and lay in a state so like death, that not only had he no feeling when they pinched and pricked him, but even when fire was applied to him, and he was  burned by it, he had no sense of pain except afterwards from the wound. And that his body remained motionless, not by reason of his self-command, but because he was insensible, was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the fact that he breathed no more than a dead man; and yet he said that, when any one spoke with more than ordinary distinctness, he heard the voice, but as if it were a long way off. &nbsp;Seeing, then, that even in this mortal and miserable life the body serves some men by many remarkable movements and moods beyond the ordinary course of nature, what reason is there for doubting that, before man was involved by his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in this weak and corruptible condition, his members might have served his will for the propagation of offspring without <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>? Man has been given over to himself because he abandoned <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while he sought to be self-satisfying; and disobeying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he could not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> even himself. Hence it is that he is involved in the obvious misery of being unable to live as he wishes. For if he lived as he wished, he would think himself blessed; but he could not be so if he lived wickedly.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25.&mdash; Of True Blessedness, Which This Present Life Cannot Enjoy.</h2>

<p>However, if we look at this a little more closely, we see that no one lives as he wishes but the blessed, and that no one is blessed but the righteous. But even the righteous himself does not live as he wishes, until he has arrived where he cannot die, be deceived, or injured, and until he is assured that this shall be his <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> condition. For this nature demands; and nature is not fully and perfectly blessed till it attains what it seeks. But what man is at present able to live as he wishes, when it is not in his power so much as to live? He wishes to live, he is compelled to die. How, then, does he live as he wishes who does not live as long as he wishes? Or if he wishes to die, how can he live as he wishes, since he does not wish even to live? Or if he wishes to die, not because he dislikes life, but that after death he may live better, still he is not yet living as he wishes, but only has the prospect of so living when, through death, he reaches that which he wishes. But admit that he lives as he wishes, because he has done <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to himself, and forced himself not to wish what he cannot obtain, and to wish only what he can (as Terence has it, <q>Since you cannot do what you will, will what you can</q> ), is he therefore blessed because he is patiently wretched? For a blessed life is possessed only by the man who loves it. If it is loved and possessed, it must necessarily be more ardently loved than all besides; for whatever else is loved must be loved for the sake of the blessed life. And if it is loved as it deserves to be&mdash;and the man is not blessed who does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the blessed life as it deserves&mdash;then he who so loves it cannot but wish it to be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Therefore it shall then only be blessed when it is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.&mdash; That We are to Believe that in Paradise Our First Parents Begot Offspring Without Blushing.</h2>

<p>In Paradise, then, man lived as he desired so long as he desired what God had commanded. He lived in the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by God's goodness; he lived without any want, and had it in his power so to live <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>. He had food that he might not hunger, drink that he might not thirst, the tree of life that old age might not waste him. There was in his body no corruption, nor seed of corruption, which could produce in him any unpleasant sensation. He feared no inward disease, no outward accident. Soundest health blessed his body, absolute tranquillity his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. As in Paradise there was no excessive heat or cold, so its inhabitants were exempt from the vicissitudes of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and desire. No sadness of any kind was there, nor any foolish <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> ceaselessly flowed from the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who was loved <q>out of a pure heart, and a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note120760"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:5</a></span> The honest <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of husband and wife made a sure harmony between them. Body and spirit worked harmoniously together, and the commandment was kept without labor. No languor made their leisure wearisome; no sleepiness interrupted their desire to labor.  <em>In tanta facilitate rerum et felicitate hominum, absit ut suspicemur, non potuisse prolem seri sine libidinis morbo: sed eo voluntatis nutu moverentur illa membra qua c&aelig;tera, et sine ardoris illecebroso stimulo cum tranquillitate animi et corporis nulla corruptione integritatis infunderetur gremio maritus uxoris. Neque enim quia experientia probari non potest, ideo credendum non est; quando illas corporis partes non ageret turbidus calor, sed spontanea potestas, sicut opus esset, adhiberet; ita tunc potuisse utero conjugis salva integritate feminei genitalis virile semen immitti, sicut nunc potest eadem integritate salva ex utero virginis fluxus menstrui cruoris emitti. Eadem quippe via posset illud injici, qua hoc potest ejici. Ut enim ad pariendum non doloris gemitus, sed maturitatis impulsus feminea viscera relaxaret: sic ad</em>  <em>f&oelig;tandum et concipiendum non libidinis appetitus, sed voluntarius usus naturam utramque conjungeret.</em> We speak of things which are now shameful, and although we try, as well as we are able, to conceive them as they were before they became shameful, yet necessity compels us rather to limit our discussion to the bounds set by modesty than to extend it as our moderate faculty of discourse might suggest. For since that which I have been speaking of was not experienced even by those who might have experienced it&mdash;I mean our first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> (for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and its merited banishment from Paradise anticipated this passionless generation on their part)&mdash;when sexual intercourse is spoken of now, it suggests to men's thoughts not such a placid <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the will as is conceivable in our first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, but such violent acting of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> as they themselves have experienced. And therefore modesty shuts my mouth, although my mind conceives the matter clearly. But Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the supreme and supremely good Creator of all natures, who aids and rewards good wills, while He abandons and condemns the bad, and rules both, was not destitute of a plan by which He might people His city with the fixed number of citizens which His wisdom had foreordained even out of the condemned <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, discriminating them not now by merits, since the whole mass was condemned as if in a vitiated root, but by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and showing, not only in the case of the redeemed, but also in those who were not delivered, how much <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> He has bestowed upon them. For every one acknowledges that he has been rescued from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not by deserved, but by gratuitous goodness, when he is singled out from the company of those with whom he might <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> have borne a common punishment, and is allowed to go scathless. Why, then, should God not have created those whom He foresaw would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since He was able to show in and by them both what their guilt merited, and what His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed, and since, under His creating and disposing hand, even the perverse disorder of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> could not pervert the right order of things?</p>

<h2>Chapter 27.&mdash; Of the Angels and Men Who Sinned, and that Their Wickedness Did Not Disturb the Order of God's Providence.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do nothing to impede the <q>great works of the Lord which accomplish His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.</q>  For He who by His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and omnipotence distributes to every one his own portion, is able to make good use not only of the good, but also of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. And thus making a good use of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, who, in punishment of his first <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> volition, was doomed to an obduracy that prevents him now from willing any good, why should not God have permitted him to tempt the first man, who had been created upright, that is to say, with a good will? For he had been so constituted, that if he looked to God for help, man's goodness should defeat the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; but if by <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> self-pleasing he abandoned <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his Creator and Sustainer, he should be conquered. If his will remained upright, through leaning on God's help, he should be rewarded; if it became <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, by forsaking <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he should be punished. But even this trusting in God's help could not itself be accomplished without God's help, although man had it in his own power to relinquish the benefits of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> by pleasing himself. For as it is not in our power to live in this world without sustaining ourselves by food, while it is in our power to refuse this nourishment and cease to live, as those do who kill themselves, so it was not in man's power, even in Paradise, to live as he ought without God's help; but it was in his power to live wickedly, though thus he should cut short his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and incur very <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> punishment. Since, then, God was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that man would fall, why should He not have suffered him to be tempted by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> and envied him? It was not, indeed, that He was unaware that he should be conquered, but because He foresaw that by the man's seed, aided by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, this same <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself should be conquered, to the greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. All was brought about in such a manner, that neither did any future event escape God's foreknowledge, nor did His foreknowledge compel any one to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and so as to demonstrate in the experience of the intelligent creation, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and angelic, how great a difference there is between the private presumption of the creature and the Creator's protection. For who will dare to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> or say that it was not in God's power to prevent both <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men from sinning? But God preferred to leave this in their power, and thus to show both what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> could be wrought by their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and what good by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28.&mdash; Of the Nature of the Two Cities, the Earthly and the Heavenly.</h2>

<p>Accordingly, two cities have been formed by two loves: the earthly by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of self, even to the contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the heavenly by  the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even to the contempt of self. The former, in a word, glories in itself, the latter in the Lord. For the one seeks <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from men; but the greatest <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the other is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.
