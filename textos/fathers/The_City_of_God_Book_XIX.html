<h1>The City of God (Book XIX)</h1>

<p class="h1a">In this book the end of the two cities, the earthly and the heavenly, is discussed. Augustine reviews the opinions of the philosophers regarding the supreme good, and their vain efforts to make for themselves a happiness in this life; and, while he refutes these, he takes occasion to show what the peace and happiness belonging to the heavenly city, or the people of Christ, are both now and hereafter.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; That Varro Has Made Out that Two Hundred and Eighty-Eight Different Sects of Philosophy Might Be Formed by the Various Opinions Regarding the Supreme Good.</h2>

<p>As I see that I have still to discuss the fit destinies of the two cities, the earthly and the heavenly, I must first explain, so far as the limits of this work allow me, the reasonings by which men have attempted to make for themselves a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in this unhappy life, in order that it may be evident, not only from divine authority, but also from such reasons as can be adduced to unbelievers, how the empty dreams of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> differ from the hope which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives to us, and from the substantial fulfillment of it which He will give us as our blessedness. Philosophers have expressed a great variety of diverse opinions regarding the ends of goods and of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and this question they have eagerly canvassed, that they might, if possible, discover what makes a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. For the end of our good is that for the sake of which other things are to be desired, while it is to be desired for its own sake; and the end of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is that on account of which other things are to be shunned, while it is avoided on its own account. Thus, by the <em>end of good</em>, we at present mean, not that by which good is destroyed, so that it no longer exists, but that by which it is finished, so that it becomes complete; and by the <em>end of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></em> we mean, not that which abolishes it, but that which completes its development. These two ends, therefore, are the supreme good and the supreme <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and, as I have said, those who have in this vain life professed the study of wisdom have been at great pains to discover these ends, and to obtain the supreme good and avoid the supreme <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in this life. And although they erred in a variety of ways, yet natural insight has prevented them from wandering from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> so far that they have not placed the supreme good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, some in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, some in the body, and some in both. From this tripartite distribution of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, Marcus Varro, in his book <em>De Philosophia</em>,  has drawn so large a variety of opinions, that, by a subtle and minute analysis of distinctions, he numbers without difficulty as many as 288 <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>&mdash;not that these have actually <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, but <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> which are possible.</p>

<p>To illustrate briefly what he means, I must begin with his own introductory statement in the above-mentioned book, that there are four things which men desire, as it were by nature without a master, without the help of any instruction, without industry or the art of living which is called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and which is certainly learned:  either pleasure, which is an agreeable stirring of the bodily sense; or repose, which excludes every bodily inconvenience; or both these, which <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> calls by the one name, pleasure; or the primary objects  of nature,  which comprehend the things already named and other things, either bodily, such as health, and safety, and integrity of the members, or spiritual, such as the greater and less mental gifts that are found in men. Now these four things&mdash; pleasure, repose, the two combined, and the primary objects of nature&mdash; exist in us in such sort that we must either desire <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> on their account, or them for the sake of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or both for their own sake; and consequently there arise from this distinction twelve <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, for each is by this consideration tripled. I will illustrate this in one instance, and, having done so, it will not be difficult to understand the others. According, then, as bodily pleasure is subjected, preferred, or united to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, there are three <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. It is subjected to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> when it is chosen as subservient to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Thus it is a duty of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to live for one's country, and for its sake to beget children, neither of which can be done without bodily pleasure. For there is pleasure in eating and drinking, pleasure also in sexual intercourse. But when it is preferred to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it is desired for its own sake, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is chosen only for its sake, and to effect nothing else than the attainment or preservation of bodily pleasure. And this, indeed, is to make life hideous; for where <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the slave of pleasure it no longer deserves the name of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Yet even this disgraceful distortion has found some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> to patronize and defend it. Then <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is united to pleasure when neither is desired for the other's sake, but both for their own. And therefore, as pleasure, according as it is subjected, preferred, or united to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, makes three <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, so also do repose, pleasure and repose combined, and the prime natural blessings, make their three <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> each. For as men's opinions vary, and these four things are sometimes subjected, sometimes preferred, and sometimes united to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, there are produced twelve <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. But this number again is doubled by the addition of one difference, viz., the social life; for whoever attaches himself to any of these <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> does so either for his own sake alone, or for the sake of a companion, for whom he ought to wish what he desires for himself. And thus there will be twelve of those who think some one of these opinions should be held for their own sakes, and other twelve who decide that they ought to follow this or that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> not for their own sakes only, but also for the sake of others whose good they desire as their own. These twenty-four <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> again are doubled, and become forty-eight by adding a difference taken from the New Academy. For each of these four and twenty <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> can hold and defend their opinion as certain, as the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> defended the position that the supreme good of man consisted solely in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; or they can be held as probable, but not certain, as the New Academics did. There are, therefore, twenty-four who hold their <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> as certainly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, other twenty-four who hold their opinions as probable, but not certain. Again, as each person who attaches himself to any of these <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> may adopt the mode of life either of the <a href="../cathen/04582a.htm">Cynics</a> or of the other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, this distinction will double the number, and so make ninety-six <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. Then, lastly, as each of these <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> may be adhered to either by men who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a life of ease, as those who have through choice or necessity addicted themselves to study, or by men who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a busy life, as those who, while <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophizing</a>, have been much occupied with state affairs and public business, or by men who choose a mixed life, in imitation of those who have apportioned their time partly to erudite leisure, partly to necessary business: by these differences the number of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> is tripled, and becomes 288.</p>

<p>I have thus, as briefly and lucidly as I could, given in my own words the opinions which Varro expresses in his book. But how he refutes all the rest of these <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, and chooses one, the Old Academy, instituted by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and continuing to Polemo, the fourth teacher of that school of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which held that their system was certain; and how on this ground he distinguishes it from the New Academy,  which began with Polemo's successor Arcesilaus, and held that all things are uncertain; and how he seeks to establish that the Old Academy was as free from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> as from <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>&mdash;all this, I say, were too long to enter upon in detail, and yet I must not altogether pass it by in silence. Varro then rejects, as a first step, all those differences which have multiplied the number of <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>; and the ground on which he does so is that they are not differences about the supreme good. He maintains that in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> is created only by its having an opinion of its own different from other schools on the point of the ends-in-chief. For man has no other reason for <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophizing</a> than that he may be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; but that which makes him <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> is itself the supreme good. In other words, the supreme good is the reason of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophizing</a>; and therefore that cannot be called a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which pursues no way of its own towards the supreme good. Thus, when it is  asked whether a wise man will adopt the social life, and desire and be interested in the supreme good of his friend as in his own, or will, on the contrary, do all that he does merely for his own sake, there is no question here about the supreme good, but only about the propriety of associating or not associating a friend in its participation: whether the wise man will do this not for his own sake, but for the sake of his friend in whose good he delights as in his own. So, too, when it is asked whether all things about which <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is concerned are to be considered uncertain, as by the New Academy, or certain, as the other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> maintain, the question here is not what end should be pursued, but whether or not we are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the substantial <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of that end; or, to put it more plainly, whether he who pursues the supreme good must maintain that it is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> good, or only that it appears to him to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, though possibly it may be delusive,&mdash; both pursuing one and the same good. The distinction, too, which is founded on the dress and manners of the <a href="../cathen/04582a.htm">Cynics</a>, does not touch the question of the chief good, but only the question whether he who pursues that good which seems to himself <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> should live as do the <a href="../cathen/04582a.htm">Cynics</a>. There were, in fact, men who, though they pursued different things as the supreme good, some choosing pleasure, others <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, yet adopted that mode of life which gave the <a href="../cathen/04582a.htm">Cynics</a> their name. Thus, whatever it is which distinguishes the <a href="../cathen/04582a.htm">Cynics</a> from other <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, this has no bearing on the choice and pursuit of that good which constitutes <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For if it had any such bearing, then the same habits of life would necessitate the pursuit of the same chief good, and diverse habits would necessitate the pursuit of different ends.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; How Varro, by Removing All the Differences Which Do Not Form Sects, But are Merely Secondary Questions, Reaches Three Definitions of the Chief Good, of Which We Must Choose One.</h2>

<p>The same may be said of those three kinds of life, the life of studious leisure and search after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the life of easy engagement in affairs, and the life in which both these are mingled. When it is asked, which of these should be adopted, this involves no controversy about the end of good, but inquires which of these three puts a man in the best position for finding and retaining the supreme good. For this good, as soon as a man finds it, makes him <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; but lettered leisure, or public business, or the alternation of these, do not necessarily constitute <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Many, in fact, find it possible to adopt one or other of these modes of life, and yet to miss what makes a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. The question, therefore, regarding the supreme good and the supreme <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and which distinguishes <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, is one; and these questions concerning the social life, the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of the Academy, the dress and food of the <a href="../cathen/04582a.htm">Cynics</a>, the three modes of life&mdash; the active, the contemplative, and the mixed&mdash; these are different questions, into none of which the question of the chief good enters. And therefore, as Marcus Varro multiplied the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> to the number of 288 (or whatever larger number he chose) by introducing these four differences derived from the social life, the New Academy, the <a href="../cathen/04582a.htm">Cynics</a>, and the threefold form of life, so, by removing these differences as having no bearing on the supreme good, and as therefore not constituting what can properly be called <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, he returns to those twelve schools which concern themselves with inquiring what that good is which makes man <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, and he shows that one of these is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the rest false. In other words, he dismisses the distinction founded on the threefold mode of life, and so decreases the whole number by two-thirds, reducing the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> to ninety-six. Then, putting aside the Cynic peculiarities, the number decreases by a half, to forty-eight. Taking away next the distinction occasioned by the hesitancy of the New Academy, the number is again halved, and reduced to twenty-four. Treating in a similar way the diversity introduced by the consideration of the social life, there are left but twelve, which this difference had doubled to twenty-four. Regarding these twelve, no reason can be assigned why they should not be called <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. For in them the sole inquiry is regarding the supreme good and the ultimate <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>&mdash;that is to say, regarding the supreme good, for this being found, the opposite <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is thereby found. Now, to make these twelve <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, he multiplies by three these four things&mdash; pleasure, repose, pleasure and repose combined, and the primary objects of nature which Varro calls <em>primigenia</em>. For as these four things are sometimes subordinated to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so that they seem to be desired not for their own sake, but for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> sake; sometimes preferred to it, so that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> seems to be necessary not on its own account, but in order to attain these things; sometimes joined with it, so that both they and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are desired for their own sakes&mdash;we must multiply the four by three, and thus we get twelve <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. But from those four things Varro eliminates three&mdash; pleasure, repose,  pleasure and repose combined&mdash; not because he thinks these are not worthy of the place assigned them, but because they are included in the primary objects of nature. And what need is there, at any rate, to make a threefold division out of these two ends, pleasure and repose, taking them first severally and then conjunctly, since both they, and many other things besides, are comprehended in the primary objects of nature? Which of the three remaining <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> must be chosen? This is the question that Varro dwells upon. For whether one of these three or some other be chosen, reason forbids that more than one be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. This we shall afterwards see; but meanwhile let us explain as briefly and distinctly as we can how Varro makes his selection from these three, that is, from the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> which severally hold that the primary objects of nature are to be desired for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> sake, that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is to be desired for their sake, and that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and these objects are to be desired each for their own sake.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; Which of the Three Leading Opinions Regarding the Chief Good Should Be Preferred, According to Varro, Who Follows Antiochus and the Old Academy.</h2>

<p>Which of these three is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and to be adopted he attempts to show in the following manner. As it is the supreme good, not of a tree, or of a beast, or of a god, but of man that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is in quest of, he thinks that, first of all, we must define man. He is of opinion that there are two parts in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and makes no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that of these two the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the better and by far the more worthy part. But whether the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone is the man, so that the body holds the same relation to it as a horse to the horseman, this he thinks has to be ascertained. The horseman is not a horse and a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but only a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, yet he is called a horseman, because he is in some relation to the horse. Again, is the body alone the man, having a relation to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> such as the cup has to the drink? For it is not the cup and the drink it contains which are called the cup, but the cup alone; yet it is so called because it is made to hold the drink. Or, lastly, is it neither the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone nor the body alone, but both together, which are man, the body and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being each a part, but the whole man being both together, as we call two horses yoked together a pair, of which pair the near and the off horse is each a part, but we do not call either of them, no matter how connected with the other, a pair, but only both together? Of these three alternatives, then, Varro chooses the third, that man is neither the body alone, nor the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone, but both together. And therefore the highest good, in which lies the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is composed of goods of both kinds, both bodily and spiritual. And consequently he thinks that the primary objects of nature are to be sought for their own sake, and that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which is the art of living, and can be communicated by instruction, is the most excellent of spiritual goods. This <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, then, or art of regulating life, when it has received these primary objects of nature which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> independently of it, and prior to any instruction, seeks them all, and itself also, for its own sake; and it uses them, as it also uses itself, that from them all it may derive profit and enjoyment, greater or less, according as they are themselves greater or less; and while it takes pleasure in all of them, it despises the less that it may obtain or retain the greater when occasion demands. Now, of all goods, spiritual or bodily, there is none at all to compare with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> makes a good use both of itself and of all other goods in which lies man's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; and where it is absent, no matter how many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things a man has, they are not for his good, and consequently should not be called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things while they belong to one who makes them useless by using them badly. The life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, then, is called <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> when it enjoys <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and these other spiritual and bodily <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things without which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is impossible. It is called happier if it enjoys some or many other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which are not essential to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and happiest of all, if it lacks not one of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which pertain to the body and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For life is not the same thing as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since not every life, but a wisely regulated life, is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and yet, while there can be life of some kind without <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, there cannot be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> without life. This I might apply to memory and reason, and such mental faculties; for these exist prior to instruction, and without them there cannot be any instruction, and consequently no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, since <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is learned. But bodily advantages, such as swiftness of foot, beauty, or strength, are not essential to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, neither is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> essential to them, and yet they are <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; and, according to our <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, even these advantages are desired by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> for its own sake, and are used and enjoyed by it in a becoming manner.</p>

<p>They say that this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life is also social, and loves the advantages of its friends as its own, and for their sake wishes for them what it desires for itself, whether these friends live in the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, as a wife, children,  domestics; or in the locality where one's home is, as the citizens of the same town; or in the world at large, as the nations bound in common <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> brotherhood; or in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> itself, comprehended in the heavens and the earth, as those whom they call gods, and provide as friends for the wise man, and whom we more familiarly call <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Moreover, they say that, regarding the supreme good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, there is no room for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and that they therefore differ from the New Academy in this respect, and they are not concerned whether a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> pursues those ends which they think <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the Cynic dress and manner of life or in some other. And, lastly, in regard to the three modes of life, the contemplative, the active, and the composite, they declare in favor of the third. That these were the opinions and doctrines of the Old Academy, Varro asserts on the authority of Antiochus, Cicero's master and his own, though Cicero makes him out to have been more frequently in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> than with the Old Academy. But of what importance is this to us, who ought to judge the matter on its own merits, rather than to understand accurately what different men have thought about it?</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; What the Christians Believe Regarding the Supreme Good and Evil, in Opposition to the Philosophers, Who Have Maintained that the Supreme Good is in Themselves.</h2>

<p>If, then, we be asked what the city of God has to say upon these points, and, in the first place, what its opinion regarding the supreme good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is, it will reply that life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> is the supreme good, death <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> the supreme <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that to obtain the one and escape the other we must live rightly. And thus it is written, <q>The just lives by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121263"><a href="../bible/hab002.htm#verse4">Habakkuk&nbsp;2:4</a></span> for we do not as yet see our good, and must therefore live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; neither have we in ourselves power to live rightly, but can do so only if He who has given us <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His help do help us when we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. As for those who have supposed that the sovereign good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are to be found in this life, and have placed it either in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or the body, or in both, or, to speak more explicitly, either in pleasure or in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or in both; in repose or in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or in both; in pleasure and repose, or in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or in all combined; in the primary objects of nature, or in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or in both&mdash;all these have, with a marvelous shallowness, sought to find their blessedness in this life and in themselves. Contempt has been poured upon such ideas by the Truth, saying by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the thoughts of men</q> (or, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> cites the passage, <q>The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the thoughts of the <em>wise</em></q>) <q>that they are vain.</q> </p>

<p>For what flood of eloquence can suffice to detail the miseries of this life? Cicero, in the <em> Consolation</em> on the death of his daughter, has spent all his ability in lamentation; but how inadequate was even his ability here? For when, where, how, in this life can these primary objects of nature be possessed so that they may not be assailed by unforeseen accidents? Is the body of the wise man exempt from any pain which may dispel pleasure, from any disquietude which may banish repose? The amputation or decay of the members of the body puts an end to its integrity, deformity blights its beauty, weakness its health, lassitude its vigor, sleepiness or sluggishness its activity&mdash;and which of these is it that may not assail the flesh of the wise man? Comely and fitting attitudes and movements of the body are numbered among the prime natural blessings; but what if some sickness makes the members tremble? What if a man suffers from curvature of the spine to such an extent that his hands reach the ground, and he goes upon all-fours like a quadruped? Does not this destroy all beauty and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the body, whether at rest or in motion? What shall I say of the fundamental blessings of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, sense and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, of which the one is given for the perception, and the other for the comprehension of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? But what kind of sense is it that remains when a man becomes deaf and blind? Where are reason and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> when disease makes a man delirious? We can scarcely, or not at all, refrain from tears, when we think of or see the actions and words of such frantic <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and consider how different from and even opposed to their own sober judgment and ordinary conduct their present demeanor is. And what shall I say of those who suffer from <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demoniacal</a> possession? &nbsp;Where is their own intelligence hidden and buried while the malignant spirit is using their body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> according to his own will? And who is quite sure that no such thing can happen to the wise man in this life? Then, as to the perception of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, what can we hope for even in this way while in the body, as we read in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> book of Wisdom, <q>The corruptible body weighs down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the earthly tabernacle presses down the mind that muses upon many things?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121265"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span> And eagerness, or  desire of action, if this is the right meaning to put upon the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1F41;&#x03C1;&#x03BC;&#x03B7;</span>, is also reckoned among the primary advantages of nature; and yet is it not this which produces those pitiable movements of the insane, and those actions which we shudder to see, when sense is deceived and reason deranged?</p>

<p>In fine, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself, which is not among the primary objects of nature, but succeeds to them as the result of learning, though it holds the highest place among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, what is its occupation save to wage perpetual <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>&mdash;not those that are outside of us, but within; not other men's, but our own&mdash;a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which is waged especially by that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which the Greeks call <span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C9;&#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;</span>, and we <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>,  and which bridles carnal <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and prevents them from winning the consent of the spirit to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>? For we must not fancy that there is no <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in us, when, as the apostle says, <q>The flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the spirit;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121267"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> for to this <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> there is a contrary <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, when, as the same writer says, <q>The spirit <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the flesh.</q> <q>For these two,</q> he says, <q>are contrary one to the other, so that you cannot do the things which you would.</q> But what is it we wish to do when we seek to attain the supreme good, unless that the flesh should cease to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> against the spirit, and that there be no <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in us against which the spirit may <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>? And as we cannot attain to this in the present life, however ardently we desire it, let us by God's help accomplish at least this, to preserve the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from succumbing and yielding to the flesh that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against it, and to refuse our consent to the perpetration of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Far be it from us, then, to fancy that while we are still engaged in this intestine <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, we have already found the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which we seek to reach by victory. And who is there so wise that he has no conflict at all to maintain against his <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>?</p>

<p>What shall I say of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is called <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>? Is not all its vigilance spent in the discernment of good from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, so that no mistake may be admitted about what we should desire and what avoid? And thus it is itself a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that we are in the midst of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, or that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are in us; for it teaches us that it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to consent to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and a good to refuse this consent. And yet this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, to which <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> teaches and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> enables us not to consent, is removed from this life neither by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> nor by <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. And <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whose office it is to render to every man his due, whereby there is in man himself a certain just order of nature, so that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is subjected to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the flesh to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and consequently both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and flesh to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;does not this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> demonstrate that it is as yet rather laboring towards its end than resting in its finished work? For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is so much the less subjected to God as it is less occupied with the thought of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the flesh is so much the less subjected to the spirit as it <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> more vehemently against the spirit. So long, therefore, as we are beset by this weakness, this plague, this disease, how shall we dare to say that we are safe? And if not safe, then how can we be already enjoying our final beatitude? Then that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which goes by the name of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> is the plainest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the ills of life, for it is these ills which it is compelled to bear patiently. And this holds good, no matter though the ripest wisdom co-exists with it. And I am at a loss to understand how the Stoic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> can presume to say that these are no ills, though at the same time they allow the wise man to commit suicide and pass out of this life if they become so grievous that he cannot or ought not to endure them. But such is the stupid <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of these men who fancy that the supreme good can be found in this life, and that they can become <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> by their own resources, that their wise man, or at least the man whom they fancifully depict as such, is always <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, even though he become blind, deaf, dumb, mutilated, racked with pains, or suffer any conceivable calamity such as may compel him to make away with himself; and they are not ashamed to call the life that is beset with these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. O <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life, which seeks the aid of death to end it? If it is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, let the wise man remain in it; but if these ills drive him out of it, in what sense is it <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>? Or how can they say that these are not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which conquer the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and force it not only to yield, but so to rave that it in one breath calls life <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> and recommends it to be given up? For who is so blind as not to see that if it were <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> it would not be fled from? And if they say we should flee from it on account of the infirmities that beset it, why then do they not lower their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and acknowledge that it is miserable? Was it, I would ask, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> or weakness which prompted Cato to kill himself? For he would not have done so had he not been too weak to endure C&aelig;sar's victory. Where, then, is his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>? It has yielded, it has succumbed, it has been so thoroughly overcome as to abandon, forsake, flee this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life. Or was it no longer <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>? Then it was miserable. How, then, were these not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which made life miserable, and a thing to be escaped from?</p> 

<p>And therefore those who admit that these are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, as the Peripatetics do, and the Old Academy, the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> which Varro advocates, express a more intelligible doctrine; but theirs also is a surprising mistake, for they contend that this is a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life which is beset by these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, even though they be so great that he who endures them should commit suicide to escape them. <q>Pains and anguish of body,</q> says Varro, <q>are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and so much the worse in proportion to their severity; and to escape them you must quit this life.</q> What life, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>? This life, he says, which is oppressed by such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Then it is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in the midst of these very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> on account of which you say we must quit it? Or do you call it <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> because you are at liberty to escape these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> by death? What, then, if by some secret <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> you were held fast and not permitted to die, nor suffered to live without these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>? In that case, at least, you would say that such a life was miserable. It is soon relinquished, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but this does not make it not miserable; for were it <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, you yourself would pronounce it miserable. Its brevity, therefore, does not clear it of misery; neither ought it to be called <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> because it is a brief misery. Certainly there is a mighty force in these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which compel a man&mdash; according to them even a wise man&mdash; to cease to be a man that he may escape them, though they say, and say <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, that it is as it were the first and strongest demand of nature that a man cherish himself, and naturally therefore avoid death, and should so stand his own friend as to wish and vehemently aim at continuing to exist as a living creature, and subsisting in this union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. There is a mighty force in these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to overcome this natural instinct by which death is by every means and with all a man's efforts avoided, and to overcome it so completely that what was avoided is desired, sought after, and if it cannot in any other way be obtained, is inflicted by the man on himself. There is a mighty force in these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which make <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> a homicide,&mdash; if, indeed, that is to be called <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> which is so thoroughly overcome by these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, that it not only cannot preserve by patience the man whom it undertook to govern and defend, but is itself <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to kill him. The wise man, I admit, ought to bear death with patience, but when it is inflicted by another. If, then, as these men maintain, he is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to inflict it on himself, certainly it must be owned that the ills which compel him to this are not only <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, but intolerable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. The life, then, which is either subject to accidents, or environed with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> so considerable and grievous, could never have been called <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, if the men who give it this name had condescended to yield to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and to be conquered by valid arguments, when they inquired after the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life, as they yield to unhappiness, and are overcome by overwhelming <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, when they put themselves to death, and if they had not fancied that the supreme good was to be found in this mortal life; for the very <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of this life, which are certainly its best and most useful possessions, are all the more telling <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of its miseries in proportion as they are helpful against the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of its dangers, toils, and woes. For if these are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>&mdash;and such cannot exist save in those who have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>&mdash;they do not profess to be able to deliver the men who possess them from all miseries; for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> tell no such lies, but they profess that by the hope of the future world this life, which is miserably involved in the many and great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of this world, is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> as it is also safe. For if not yet safe, how could it be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>? And therefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, speaking not of men without <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but of those whose lives were regulated by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and whose <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> were therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, says, <q>For we are saved by hope: now hope which is seen is not hope; for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121268"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;8:24</a></span> As, therefore, we are saved, so we are made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> by hope. And as we do not as yet possess a present, but look for a future <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, so is it with our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and this <q>with patience;</q> for we are encompassed with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, which we ought patiently to endure, until we come to the ineffable enjoyment of unmixed good; for there shall be no longer anything to endure. Salvation, such as it shall be in the world to come, shall itself be our final <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. And this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in, because they do not see it, and attempt to fabricate for themselves a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in this life, based upon a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is as deceitful as it is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; Of the Social Life, Which, Though Most Desirable, is Frequently Disturbed by Many Distresses.</h2>

<p>We give a much more unlimited approval to their idea that the life of the wise man must be social. For how could the city of God (concerning which we are already writing no less than the nineteenth book of this work)  either take a beginning or be developed, or attain its proper destiny, if the life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were not a social life? But who can enumerate all the great grievances with which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society abounds in the misery of this mortal state? Who can weigh them? Hear how one of their comic writers makes one of his characters express the common feelings of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in this matter: <q>I am married; this is one misery. Children are born to me; they are additional cares.</q>  What shall I say of the miseries of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which Terence also recounts&mdash; <q>slights, suspicions, quarrels, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> today, peace tomorrow?</q>  Is not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life full of such things? Do they not often occur even in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> friendships? On all hands we experience these slights, suspicions, quarrels, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, all of which are undoubted <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; while, on the other hand, peace is a doubtful good, because we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the heart of our friend, and though we did <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it today, we should be as <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what it might be tomorrow. Who ought to be, or who are more friendly than those who live in the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>? And yet who can rely even upon this friendship, seeing that secret treachery has often broken it up, and produced enmity as bitter as the amity was sweet, or seemed sweet by the most perfect dissimulation? It is on this account that the words of Cicero so move the heart of every one, and provoke a sigh: <q>There are no snares more dangerous than those which lurk under the guise of duty or the name of relationship. For the man who is your declared foe you can easily baffle by precaution; but this hidden, intestine, and domestic danger not merely exists, but overwhelms you before you can foresee and examine it.</q>  It is also to this that allusion is made by the divine saying, <q>A man's foes are those of his own household,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121272"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse36">Matthew&nbsp;10:36</a></span> &mdash; words which one cannot hear without pain; for though a man have sufficient <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to endure it with equanimity, and sufficient sagacity to baffle the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of a pretended friend, yet if he himself is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, he cannot but be greatly pained at the discovery of the perfidy of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, whether they have always been <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and merely feigned goodness, or have fallen from a better to a malicious disposition. If, then, home, the natural refuge from the ills of life, is itself not safe, what shall we say of the city, which, as it is larger, is so much the more filled with lawsuits civil and criminal, and is never free from the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, if sometimes from the actual outbreak, of disturbing and bloody insurrections and civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; Of the Error of Human Judgments When the Truth is Hidden.</h2>

<p>What shall I say of these judgments which men pronounce on men, and which are necessary in communities, whatever outward peace they enjoy? Melancholy and lamentable judgments they are, since the judges are men who cannot discern the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a> of those at their bar, and are therefore frequently compelled to put innocent witnesses to the torture to ascertain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> regarding the crimes of other men. What shall I say of torture applied to the accused himself? He is tortured to discover whether he is guilty, so that, though innocent, he suffers most undoubted punishment for crime that is still doubtful, not because it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that he committed it, but because it is not ascertained that he did not commit it. Thus the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the judge frequently involves an innocent person in suffering. And what is still more unendurable&mdash; a thing, indeed, to be bewailed, and, if that were possible, watered with fountains of tears&mdash; is this, that when the judge puts the accused to the question, that he may not unwittingly put an innocent man to death, the result of this lamentable <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is that this very person, whom he tortured that he might not condemn him if innocent, is condemned to death both tortured and innocent. For if he has chosen, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> instructions to the wise man, to quit this life rather than endure any longer such tortures, he declares that he has committed the crime which in fact he has not committed. And when he has been condemned and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, the judge is still in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> whether he has <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> an innocent or a guilty person, though he put the accused to the torture for the very purpose of saving himself from condemning the innocent; and consequently he has both tortured an innocent man to discover his innocence, and has put him to death without discovering it. If such darkness shrouds social life, will a wise judge take his seat on the bench or no? Beyond question he will. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society, which he thinks it a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> to abandon, constrains him and compels him to this duty. And he thinks it no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> that innocent witnesses are tortured regarding the crimes of which other men are accused; or that the accused are put to the torture, so that they are often overcome with anguish, and, though innocent, make false confessions regarding themselves, and are punished; or that, though they be not condemned to die, they often die during, or in consequence of, the torture; or that sometimes the accusers, who perhaps have been prompted  by a desire to benefit society by bringing criminals to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, are themselves condemned through the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the judge, because they are unable to prove the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of their accusations though they are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and because the witnesses lie, and the accused endures the torture without being moved to confession. These numerous and important <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> he does not consider <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for the wise judge does these things, not with any intention of doing harm, but because his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> compels him, and because <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society claims him as a judge. But though we therefore acquit the judge of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, we must none the less condemn <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life as miserable. And if he is compelled to torture and punish the innocent because his office and his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> constrain him, is he a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> as well as a guiltless man? Surely it were <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of more profound considerateness and finer feeling were he to recognize the misery of these necessities, and shrink from his own implication in that misery; and had he any <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> about him, he would cry to God <q>From my necessities deliver me.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; Of the Diversity of Languages, by Which the Intercourse of Men is Prevented; And of the Misery of Wars, Even of Those Called Just.</h2>

<p>After the state or city comes the world, the third circle of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society,&mdash; the first being the house, and the second the city. And the world, as it is larger, so it is fuller of dangers, as the greater sea is the more dangerous. And here, in the first place, man is separated from man by the difference of languages. For if two men, each <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the other's language, meet, and are not compelled to pass, but, on the contrary, to remain in company, dumb animals, though of different species, would more easily hold intercourse than they, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings though they be. For their common nature is no help to friendliness when they are prevented by diversity of language from conveying their sentiments to one another; so that a man would more readily hold intercourse with his dog than with a foreigner. But the imperial city has endeavored to impose on subject nations not only her yoke, but her language, as a bond of peace, so that interpreters, far from being scarce, are numberless. This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but how many great <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, how much slaughter and bloodshed, have provided this unity! And though these are past, the end of these miseries has not yet come. For though there have never been wanting, nor are yet wanting, hostile nations beyond the empire, against whom <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> have been and are waged, yet, supposing there were no such nations, the very extent of the empire itself has produced <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of a more obnoxious description&mdash; social and civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>&mdash; and with these the whole race has been agitated, either by the actual conflict or the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of a renewed outbreak. If I attempted to give an adequate description of these manifold disasters, these stern and lasting necessities, though I am quite unequal to the task, what limit could I set? But, say they, the wise man will wage just <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. As if he would not all the rather lament the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of just <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, if he remembers that he is a man; for if they were not just he would not wage them, and would therefore be delivered from all <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. For it is the wrongdoing of the opposing party which compels the wise man to wage just <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>; and this wrong-doing, even though it gave rise to no <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, would still be matter of grief to man because it is man's wrong-doing. Let every one, then, who thinks with pain on all these great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, so horrible, so ruthless, acknowledge that this is misery. And if any one either endures or thinks of them without mental pain, this is a more miserable plight still, for he thinks himself <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> because he has lost <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feeling.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; That the Friendship of Good Men Cannot Be Securely Rested In, So Long as the Dangers of This Life Force Us to Be Anxious.</h2>

<p>In our present wretched condition we frequently mistake a friend for an enemy, and an enemy for a friend. And if we escape this pitiable blindness, is not the unfeigned confidence and mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and good friends our one solace in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society, filled as it is with misunderstandings and calamities? And yet the more friends we have, and the more widely they are scattered, the more numerous are our fears that some portion of the vast masses of the disasters of life may light upon them. For we are not only anxious lest they suffer from famine, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, disease, captivity, or the inconceivable horrors of slavery, but we are also affected with the much more painful dread that their friendship may be changed into perfidy, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. And when these contingencies actually occur&mdash;as they do the more frequently the more friends we have, and the more widely they are scattered&mdash;and when they come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, who but the man who has experienced it can tell with what pangs the heart is torn? We would, in fact, prefer to hear that they  were dead, although we could not without anguish hear of even this. For if their life has solaced us with the charms of friendship, can it be that their death should affect us with no sadness? He who will have none of this sadness must, if possible, have no friendly intercourse. Let him interdict or extinguish friendly affection; let him burst with ruthless insensibility the bonds of every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> relationship; or let him contrive so to use them that no sweetness shall distil into his spirit. But if this is utterly impossible, how shall we contrive to feel no bitterness in the death of those whose life has been sweet to us? Hence arises that grief which affects the tender heart like a wound or a bruise, and which is healed by the application of kindly consolation. For though the cure is affected all the more easily and rapidly the better condition the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in, we must not on this account suppose that there is nothing at all to heal. Although, then, our present life is afflicted, sometimes in a milder, sometimes in a more painful degree, by the death of those very dear to us, and especially of useful public men, yet we would prefer to hear that such men were dead rather than to hear or perceive that they had fallen from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>&mdash;in other words, that they were spiritually dead. Of this vast material for misery the earth is full, and therefore it is written, <q>Is not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life upon earth a trial?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121274"><a href="../bible/job007.htm#verse1">Job&nbsp;7:1</a></span> And with the same reference the Lord says, <q>Woe to the world because of offenses!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121275"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;17:7</a></span> and again, <q>Because iniquity abounded, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of many shall wax cold.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121276"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;24:12</a></span> And hence we enjoy some gratification when our good friends die; for though their death leaves us in sorrow, we have the consolatory assurance that they are beyond the ills by which in this life even the best of men are broken down or corrupted, or are in danger of both results.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; Of the Friendship of the Holy Angels, Which Men Cannot Be Sure of in This Life, Owing to the Deceit of the Demons Who Hold in Bondage the Worshippers of a Plurality of Gods.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who wished us to have the gods for our friends rank the friendship of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the fourth circle of society, advancing now from the three circles of society on earth to the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and embracing heaven itself. And in this friendship we have indeed no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will grieve us by their death or deterioration. But as we cannot mingle with them as familiarly as with men (which itself is one of the grievances of this life), and as <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, as we read, <span class="stiki" id="note121277"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:14</a></span> sometimes transforms himself into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light, to tempt those whom it is necessary to discipline, or just to deceive, there is great need of God's mercy to preserve us from making friends of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> in disguise, while we fancy we have good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> for our friends; for the astuteness and deceitfulness of these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits is equalled by their hurtfulness. And is this not a great misery of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, that we are involved in such <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> as, but for God's mercy, makes us a prey to these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>? And it is very certain that the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the godless city, who have maintained that the gods were their friends, had fallen a prey to the malignant <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who rule that city, and whose <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment is to be shared by it. For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of these beings is sufficiently evinced by the sacred or rather <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> observances which form their worship, and by the filthy games in which their crimes are celebrated, and which they themselves originated and exacted from their worshippers as a fit propitiation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; The Reward Prepared for the Saints After They Have Endured the Trial of This Life.</h2>

<p>But not even the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and faithful worshippers of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and most high God are safe from the manifold <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> and deceits of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For in this abode of weakness, and in these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> days, this state of anxiety has also its use, stimulating us to seek with keener longing for that security where peace is complete and unassailable. There we shall enjoy the gifts of nature, that is to say, all that God the Creator of all natures has bestowed upon ours&mdash;gifts not only good, but <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>&mdash;not only of the spirit, healed now by wisdom, but also of the body renewed by the resurrection. There the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> shall no longer be struggling against any <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but shall enjoy the reward of victory, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> peace which no adversary shall disturb. This is the final blessedness, this the ultimate consummation, the unending end. Here, indeed, we are said to be blessed when we have such peace as can be enjoyed in a good life; but such blessedness is mere misery compared to that final felicity. When we mortals possess such peace as this mortal life can afford, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, if we are living rightly, makes a right use of the advantages of this peaceful condition; and when we have it not, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> makes a good use even of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> a man suffers. But this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>,  when it refers all the advantages it makes a good use of, and all that it does in making good use of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, and itself also, to that end in which we shall enjoy the best and greatest peace possible.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; Of the Happiness of the Eternal Peace, Which Constitutes the End or True Perfection of the Saints.</h2>

<p>And thus we may say of peace, as we have said of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, that it is the end of our good; and the rather because the Psalmist says of the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the subject of this laborious work, <q>Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, O Zion: for He has strengthened the bars of your gates; He has blessed your children within you; who has made your borders peace.</q>  For when the bars of her gates shall be strengthened, none shall go in or come out from her; consequently we ought to understand the peace of her borders as that final peace we are wishing to declare. For even the mystical name of the city itself, that is, <em> Jerusalem</em>, means, as I have already said, <q>Vision of Peace.</q> But as the word peace is employed in connection with things in this world in which certainly life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> has no place, we have preferred to call the end or supreme good of this city life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rather than peace. Of this end the apostle says, <q>But now, being freed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and become servants to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have your fruit unto <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and the end life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121279"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse22">Romans&nbsp;6:22</a></span> But, on the other hand, as those who are not familiar with Scripture may suppose that the life of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, either because of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which some of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> even have recognized, or because of the endless punishment of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, which forms a part of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and which seems impossible unless the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> live for ever, it may therefore be advisable, in order that every one may readily understand what we mean, to say that the end or supreme good of this city is either peace in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, or <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life in peace. For peace is a good so great, that even in this earthly and mortal life there is no word we hear with such pleasure, nothing we desire with such zest, or find to be more thoroughly gratifying. So that if we dwell for a little longer on this subject, we shall not, in my opinion, be wearisome to our readers, who will attend both for the sake of understanding what is the end of this city of which we speak, and for the sake of the sweetness of peace which is dear to all.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; That Even the Fierceness of War and All the Disquietude of Men Make Towards This One End of Peace, Which Every Nature Desires.</h2>

<p>Whoever gives even moderate attention to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs and to our common nature, will recognize that if there is no man who does not wish to be joyful, neither is there any one who does not wish to have peace. For even they who make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> desire nothing but victory&mdash;desire, that is to say, to attain to peace with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For what else is victory than the conquest of those who resist us? And when this is done there is peace. It is therefore with the desire for peace that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> are waged, even by those who take pleasure in exercising their warlike nature in command and battle. And hence it is obvious that peace is the end sought for by <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. For every man seeks peace by waging <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, but no man seeks <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> by making peace. For even they who intentionally interrupt the peace in which they are living have no <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of peace, but only wish it changed into a peace that suits them better. They do not, therefore, wish to have no peace, but only one more to their mind. And in the case of sedition, when men have separated themselves from the community, they yet do not effect what they wish, unless they maintain some kind of peace with their fellow-conspirators. And therefore even <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> take care to maintain peace with their comrades, that they may with greater effect and greater safety invade the peace of other men. And if an individual happen to be of such unrivalled strength, and to be so jealous of partnership, that he trusts himself with no comrades, but makes his own plots, and commits depredations and murders on his own account, yet he maintains some shadow of peace with such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as he is unable to kill, and from whom he wishes to conceal his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. In his own home, too, he makes it his aim to be at peace with his wife and children, and any other members of his household; for unquestionably their prompt <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to his every look is a source of pleasure to him. And if this be not rendered, he is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, he chides and punishes; and even by this storm he secures the calm peace of his own home, as occasion demands. For he sees that peace cannot be maintained unless all the members of the same domestic circle be subject to one head, such as he himself is in his own house. And therefore if a city or nation offered to submit itself to him, to serve him in the same style as he had made his household serve him, he would no longer lurk in a brigand's hiding-places, but lift his head in open day as a king, though the same <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveteousness</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>  ness should remain in him. And thus all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> desire to have peace with their own circle whom they wish to govern as suits themselves. For even those whom they make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against they wish to make their own, and impose on them the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of their own peace.</p>

<p>But let us suppose a man such as poetry and mythology speak of&mdash;a man so insociable and savage as to be called rather a semi-man than a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.  Although, then, his kingdom was the solitude of a dreary cave, and he himself was so singularly bad-hearted that he was named <span class="greek">&#x039A;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>, which is the Greek word for <em>bad</em>; though he had no wife to soothe him with endearing talk, no children to play with, no sons to do his bidding, no friend to enliven him with intercourse, not even his father Vulcan (though in one respect he was happier than his father, not having begotten a monster like himself); although he gave to no man, but took as he wished whatever he could, from whomsoever he could, when he could yet in that solitary den, the floor of which, as Virgil  says, was always reeking with recent slaughter, there was nothing else than peace sought, a peace in which no one should molest him, or disquiet him with any assault or alarm. With his own body he desired to be at peace, and he was satisfied only in proportion as he had this peace. For he ruled his members, and they <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> him; and for the sake of pacifying his mortal nature, which rebelled when it needed anything, and of allaying the sedition of hunger which threatened to banish the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body, he made forays, slew, and devoured, but used the ferocity and savageness he displayed in these actions only for the preservation of his own life's peace. So that, had he been willing to make with other men the same peace which he made with himself in his own cave, he would neither have been called bad, nor a monster, nor a semi-man. Or if the appearance of his body and his vomiting smoky fires frightened men from having any dealings with him, perhaps his fierce ways arose not from a desire to do mischief, but from the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of finding a living. But he may have had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, or, at least, he was not such as the poets fancifully describe him, for they had to exalt Hercules, and did so at the expense of Cacus. It is better, then, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that such a man or semi-man never <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, and that this, in common with many other fancies of the poets, is mere fiction. For the most savage animals (and he is said to have been almost a wild beast) encompass their own species with a ring of protecting peace. They cohabit, beget, produce, suckle, and bring up their young, though very many of them are not gregarious, but solitary&mdash;not like sheep, deer, pigeons, starlings, bees, but such as lions, foxes, eagles, bats. For what tigress does not gently purr over her cubs, and lay aside her ferocity to fondle them? What kite, solitary as he is when circling over his prey, does not seek a mate, build a nest, hatch the eggs, bring up the young birds, and maintain with the mother of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> as peaceful a domestic alliance as he can? How much more powerfully do the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> nature move him to hold fellowship and maintain peace with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> so far as in him lies, since even <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> to maintain the peace of their own circle, and wish that, if possible, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> belonged to them, that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and things might serve but one head, and might, either through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> or <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, yield themselves to peace with him! It is thus that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in its perversity apes God. It abhors equality with other men under Him; but, instead of His rule, it seeks to impose a rule of its own upon its equals. It abhors, that is to say, the just peace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and loves its own <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> peace; but it cannot help loving peace of one kind or other. For there is no <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> so clean contrary to nature that it obliterates even the faintest traces of nature.</p>

<p>He, then, who prefers what is right to what is wrong, and what is well-ordered to what is perverted, sees that the peace of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> men is not worthy to be called peace in comparison with the peace of the just. And yet even what is perverted must of necessity be in harmony with, and in dependence on, and in some part of the order of things, for otherwise it would have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> at all. Suppose a man hangs with his head downwards, this is certainly a perverted attitude of body and arrangement of its members; for that which nature requires to be above is beneath, and <em><a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> vers&acirc;</em>. This perversity disturbs the peace of the body, and is therefore painful. Nevertheless the spirit is at peace with its body, and labors for its preservation, and hence the suffering; but if it is banished from the body by its pains, then, so long as the bodily framework holds together, there is in the remains a kind of peace among the members, and hence the body remains suspended. And inasmuch as the earthly body tends towards the earth, and rests on the bond by which it is suspended, it tends thus to its natural peace, and the voice of its own weight demands a place for it to rest; and though now lifeless and without feeling, it does not fall from the peace that is natural to its place in creation, whether it already has it, or is tending towards it. For if you apply embalming preparations to  prevent the bodily frame from mouldering and dissolving, a kind of peace still unites part to part, and keeps the whole body in a suitable place on the earth&mdash;in other words, in a place that is at peace with the body. If, on the other hand, the body receive no such care, but be left to the natural course, it is disturbed by exhalations that do not harmonize with one another, and that offend our senses; for it is this which is perceived in putrefaction until it is assimilated to the elements of the world, and particle by particle enters into peace with them. Yet throughout this process the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the most high Creator and Governor are strictly observed, for it is by Him the peace of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is administered. For although minute animals are produced from the carcass of a larger animal, all these little atoms, by the law of the same Creator, serve the animals they belong to in peace. And although the flesh of dead animals be eaten by others, no matter where it be carried, nor what it be brought into contact with, nor what it be converted and changed into, it still is ruled by the same <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which pervade all things for the conservation of every mortal race, and which bring things that fit one another into harmony.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; Of the Universal Peace Which the Law of Nature Preserves Through All Disturbances, and by Which Every One Reaches His Desert in a Way Regulated by the Just Judge.</h2>

<p>The peace of the body then consists in the duly proportioned arrangement of its parts. The peace of the irrational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the harmonious repose of the appetites, and that of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the harmony of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and action. The peace of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the well-ordered and harmonious life and health of the living creature. Peace between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the well-ordered <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law. Peace between man and man is well-ordered concord. Domestic peace is the well-ordered concord between those of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> who rule and those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>. Civil peace is a similar concord among the citizens. The peace of the celestial city is the perfectly ordered and harmonious enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of one another in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The peace of all things is the tranquillity of order. Order is the distribution which allots things equal and unequal, each to its own place. And hence, though the miserable, in so far as they are such, do certainly not enjoy peace, but are severed from that tranquillity of order in which there is no disturbance, nevertheless, inasmuch as they are deservedly and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> miserable, they are by their very misery connected with order. They are not, indeed, conjoined with the blessed, but they are disjoined from them by the law of order. And though they are disquieted, their circumstances are notwithstanding adjusted to them, and consequently they have some tranquillity of order, and therefore some peace. But they are wretched because, although not wholly miserable, they are not in that place where any mixture of misery is impossible. They would, however, be more wretched if they had not that peace which arises from being in harmony with the natural order of things. When they suffer, their peace is in so far disturbed; but their peace continues in so far as they do not suffer, and in so far as their nature continues to exist. As, then, there may be life without pain, while there cannot be pain without some kind of life, so there may be peace without <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, but there cannot be <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> without some kind of peace, because <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> supposes the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of some natures to wage it, and these natures cannot exist without peace of one kind or other.</p>

<p>And therefore there is a nature in which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> does not or even cannot exist; but there cannot be a nature in which there is no good. Hence not even the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in so far as it is nature, but it was made <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by being perverted. Thus he did not abide in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note121282"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> but could not escape the judgment of the Truth; he did not abide in the tranquillity of order, but did not therefore escape the power of the Ordainer. The good imparted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to his nature did not screen him from the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of God by which order was preserved in his punishment; neither did God punish the good which He had created, but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> had committed. God did not take back all He had imparted to his nature, but something He took and something He left, that there might remain enough to be sensible of the loss of what was taken. And this very sensibility to pain is evidence of the good which has been taken away and the good which has been left. For, were nothing good left, there could be no pain on account of the good which had been lost. For he who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is still worse if he rejoices in his loss of righteousness. But he who is in pain, if he derives no benefit from it, mourns at least the loss of health. And as righteousness and health are both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and as the loss of any good thing is matter of grief, not of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>&mdash;if, at least, there is no compensation, as spiritual righteousness may compensate for the loss of bodily health&mdash;certainly it is more suitable for  a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man to grieve in punishment than to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in his fault. As, then, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of a sinner who has abandoned what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> is evidence of a bad will, so his grief for the good he has lost when he is punished is evidence of a good nature. For he who laments the peace his nature has lost is stirred to do so by some relics of peace which make his nature friendly to itself. And it is very just that in the final punishment the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and godless should in anguish bewail the loss of the natural advantages they enjoyed, and should perceive that they were most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> taken from them by that God whose benign liberality they had despised. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, the most wise Creator and most just Ordainer of all natures, who placed the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> upon earth as its greatest ornament, imparted to men some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things adapted to this life, to wit, temporal peace, such as we can enjoy in this life from health and safety and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fellowship, and all things needful for the preservation and recovery of this peace, such as the objects which are accommodated to our outward senses, light, night, the air, and waters suitable for us, and everything the body requires to sustain, shelter, heal, or beautify it: &nbsp;and all under this most equitable condition, that every man who made a good use of these advantages suited to the peace of this mortal condition, should receive ampler and better blessings, namely, the peace of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, accompanied by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in an endless life made fit for the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of one another in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but that he who used the present blessings badly should both lose them and should not receive the others.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; Of the Order and Law Which Obtain in Heaven and Earth, Whereby It Comes to Pass that Human Society Is Served by Those Who Rule It.</h2>

<p>The whole use, then, of things temporal has a reference to this result of earthly peace in the earthly community, while in the city of God it is connected with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> peace. And therefore, if we were irrational animals, we should desire nothing beyond the proper arrangement of the parts of the body and the satisfaction of the appetites,&mdash; nothing, therefore, but bodily comfort and abundance of pleasures, that the peace of the body might contribute to the peace of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For if bodily peace be awanting, a bar is put to the peace even of the irrational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since it cannot obtain the gratification of its appetites. And these two together help out the mutual peace of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, the peace of harmonious life and health. For as animals, by shunning pain, show that they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> bodily peace, and, by pursuing pleasure to gratify their appetites, show that they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> peace of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so their shrinking from death is a sufficient indication of their intense <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of that peace which binds <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in close alliance. But, as man has a rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he subordinates all this which he has in common with the beasts to the peace of his rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> may have free play and may regulate his actions, and that he may thus enjoy the well-ordered harmony of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and action which constitutes, as we have said, the peace of the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And for this purpose he must desire to be neither molested by pain, nor disturbed by desire, nor extinguished by death, that he may arrive at some useful <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by which he may regulate his life and manners. But, owing to the liability of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind to fall into mistakes, this very pursuit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> may be a snare to him unless he has a divine Master, whom he may <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> without misgiving, and who may at the same time give him such help as to preserve his own freedom. And because, so long as he is in this mortal body, he is a stranger to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he walks by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not by sight; and he therefore refers all peace, bodily or spiritual or both, to that peace which mortal man has with the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that he exhibits the well-ordered <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> law. But as this divine Master inculcates two precepts,&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of our neighbor&mdash;and as in these precepts a man finds three things he has to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>&mdash;<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, himself, and his neighbor&mdash;and that he who loves God loves himself thereby, it follows that he must endeavor to get his neighbor to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since he is ordered to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> his neighbor as himself. He ought to make this endeavor in behalf of his wife, his children, his household, all within his reach, even as he would wish his neighbor to do the same for him if he needed it; and consequently he will be at peace, or in well-ordered concord, with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as far as in him lies. And this is the order of this concord, that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in the first place, injure no one, and, in the second, do good to every one he can reach. Primarily, therefore, his own household are his care, for the law of nature and of society gives him readier access to them and greater opportunity of serving them. And hence the apostle says, <q>Now, if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and is worse than an <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121283"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:8</a></span> This is the origin of domestic peace,  or the well-ordered concord of those in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> who rule and those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>. For they who care for the rest rule&mdash;the husband the wife, the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> the children, the masters the servants; and they who are cared for <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> their husbands, the children their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, the servants their masters. But in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the just man who lives by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and is as yet a pilgrim journeying on to the celestial city, even those who rule serve those whom they seem to command; for they rule not from a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of power, but from a sense of the duty they owe to others&mdash; not because they are <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of authority, but because they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> mercy.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; Of the Liberty Proper to Man's Nature, and the Servitude Introduced by Sin&mdash;A Servitude in Which the Man Whose Will is Wicked is the Slave of His Own Lust, Though He is Free So Far as Regards Other Men.</h2>

<p>This is prescribed by the order of nature: it is thus that God has created man. For <q>let them,</q> He says, <q>have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every creeping thing which creeps on the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121284"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> He did not intend that His rational creature, who was made in His image, should have dominion over anything but the irrational creation,&mdash; not man over man, but man over the beasts. And hence the righteous men in primitive times were made shepherds of cattle rather than kings of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, God intending thus to teach us what the relative position of the creatures is, and what the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for it is with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that the condition of slavery is the result of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And this is why we do not find the word <q>slave</q> in any part of Scripture until righteous <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> branded the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of his son with this name. It is a name, therefore, introduced by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and not by nature. The origin of the Latin word for slave is supposed to be found in the circumstance that those who by the law of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> were liable to be killed were sometimes preserved by their victors, and were hence called servants.  And these circumstances could never have arisen save through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For even when we wage a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, our adversaries must be sinning; and every victory, even though gained by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, is a result of the first judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who humbles the vanquished either for the sake of removing or of punishing their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Witness that man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Daniel, who, when he was in captivity, confessed to God his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of his people, and declares with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> grief that these were the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the captivity. <span class="stiki" id="note121286"><a href="../bible/dan009.htm">Daniel&nbsp;ix</a></span> The prime <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, then, of slavery is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which brings man under the dominion of his fellow&mdash;that which does not happen save by the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with whom is no unrighteousness, and who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to award fit punishments to every variety of offense. But our Master in heaven says, <q>Every one who does <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121287"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;8:34</a></span> And thus there are many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> masters who have religious men as their slaves, and who are yet themselves in bondage; <q>for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121288"><a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:19</a></span> And beyond question it is a happier thing to be the slave of a man than of a <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; for even this very <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of ruling, to mention no others, lays waste men's hearts with the most ruthless dominion. Moreover, when men are subjected to one another in a peaceful order, the lowly position does as much good to the servant as the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> position does harm to the master. But by nature, as God first created us, no one is the slave either of man or of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This servitude is, however, penal, and is appointed by that law which enjoins the preservation of the natural order and forbids its disturbance; for if nothing had been done in violation of that law, there would have been nothing to restrain by penal servitude. And therefore the apostle admonishes slaves to be subject to their masters, and to serve them heartily and with good-will, so that, if they cannot be freed by their masters, they may themselves make their slavery in some sort free, by serving not in crafty <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but in faithful <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, until all unrighteousness pass away, and all principality and every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power be brought to nothing, and God be all in all.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; Of Equitable Rule.</h2>

<p>And therefore, although our righteous fathers  had slaves, and administered their domestic affairs so as to distinguish between the condition of slaves and the heirship of sons in regard to the blessings of this life, yet in regard to the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whom we hope for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessings, they took an equally loving oversight of all the members of their household. And this is so much in accordance with the natural order, that the head of the household was called <em>paterfamilias</em>; and this name has been so generally accepted, that even those whose rule is unrighteous are glad to apply it to themselves.  But those who are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fathers of their households desire and endeavor that all the members of their household, equally with their own children, should worship and win <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and should come to that heavenly home in which the duty of ruling men is no longer necessary, because the duty of caring for their everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> has also ceased; but, until they reach that home, masters ought to feel their position of authority a greater burden than servants their service. And if any member of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> interrupts the domestic peace by disobedience, he is corrected either by word or blow, or some kind of just and legitimate punishment, such as society permits, that he may himself be the better for it, and be readjusted to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> harmony from which he had dislocated himself. For as it is not benevolent to give a man help at the expense of some greater benefit he might receive, so it is not innocent to spare a man at the risk of his falling into graver <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. To be innocent, we must not only do harm to no man, but also restrain him from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or punish his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so that either the man himself who is punished may profit by his experience, or others be warned by his example. Since, then, the house ought to be the beginning or element of the city, and every beginning bears reference to some end of its own kind, and every element to the integrity of the whole of which it is an element, it follows plainly enough that domestic peace has a relation to civic peace&mdash;in other words, that the well-ordered concord of domestic <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> and domestic rule has a relation to the well-ordered concord of civic <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> and civic rule. And therefore it follows, further, that the father of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> ought to frame his domestic rule in accordance with the law of the city, so that the household may be in harmony with the civic order.</p>

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> which do not live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> seek their peace in the earthly advantages of this life; while the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> which live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> look for those <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessings which are promised, and use as pilgrims such advantages of time and of earth as do not fascinate and divert them from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but rather aid them to endure with greater ease, and to keep down the number of those burdens of the corruptible body which weigh upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Thus the things necessary for this mortal life are used by both kinds of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> alike, but each has its own peculiar and widely different aim in using them. The earthly city, which does not live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, seeks an earthly peace, and the end it proposes, in the well-ordered concord of civic <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> and rule, is the combination of men's wills to attain the things which are helpful to this life. The heavenly city, or rather the part of it which sojourns on earth and lives by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, makes use of this peace only because it must, until this mortal condition which necessitates it shall pass away. Consequently, so long as it lives like a captive and a stranger in the earthly city, though it has already received the promise of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>, and the gift of the Spirit as the earnest of it, it makes no scruple to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the earthly city, whereby the things necessary for the maintenance of this mortal life are administered; and thus, as this life is common to both cities, so there is a harmony between them in regard to what belongs to it. But, as the earthly city has had some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> whose doctrine is condemned by the divine teaching, and who, being deceived either by their own conjectures or by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, supposed that many gods must be invited to take an interest in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, and assigned to each a separate function and a separate department&mdash;to one the body, to another the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and in the body itself, to one the head, to another the neck, and each of the other members to one of the gods; and in like manner, in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to one god the natural capacity was assigned, to another education, to another <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, to another <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; and so the various affairs of life were assigned&mdash;cattle to one, grain to another, wine to another, oil to another, the woods to another, money to another, navigation to another, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and victories to another, marriages to another, births and fecundity to another, and other things to other gods: and as the celestial city, on the other hand, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that one God only was to be worshipped, and that to Him alone was due that service which the Greeks call <span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, and which can be given only to a god, it has come to pass that the two cities could not have common <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of religion, and that the heavenly city has been compelled in this matter to dissent, and to become obnoxious to those who think differently, and to stand the brunt of their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, except in so far as the minds of their enemies have been alarmed by the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and quelled by the manifest protection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> accorded to them. This heavenly city, then, while it sojourns on earth, calls citizens out of all nations, and gathers together a society of pilgrims of all languages, not scrupling about diversities in  the manners, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and institutions whereby earthly peace is secured and maintained, but recognizing that, however various these are, they all tend to one and the same end of earthly peace. It therefore is so far from rescinding and abolishing these diversities, that it even preserves and adopts them, so long only as no hindrance to the worship of the one supreme and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God is thus introduced. Even the heavenly city, therefore, while in its state of pilgrimage, avails itself of the peace of earth, and, so far as it can without injuring <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and godliness, desires and maintains a common agreement among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> regarding the acquisition of the necessaries of life, and makes this earthly peace bear upon the peace of heaven; for this alone can be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> called and esteemed the peace of the reasonable creatures, consisting as it does in the perfectly ordered and harmonious enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of one another in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. When we shall have reached that peace, this mortal life shall give place to one that is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and our body shall be no more this animal body which by its corruption weighs down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but a spiritual body feeling no want, and in all its members subjected to the will. In its pilgrim state the heavenly city possesses this peace by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and by this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it lives righteously when it refers to the attainment of that peace every good action towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; for the life of the city is a social life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; How Different the Uncertainty of the New Academy is from the Certainty of the Christian Faith.</h2>

<p>As regards the uncertainty about everything which Varro alleges to be the differentiating characteristic of the New Academy, the city of God thoroughly detests such <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. Regarding matters which it apprehends by the mind and reason it has most absolute certainty, although its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is limited because of the corruptible body pressing down the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, for, as the apostle says, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121290"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:9</a></span> It believes also the evidence of the senses which the mind uses by aid of the body; for [if one who trusts his senses is sometimes deceived], he is more wretchedly deceived who fancies he should never trust them. It believes also the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, old and new, which we call canonical, and which are the source of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by which the just lives <span class="stiki" id="note121291"><a href="../bible/hab002.htm#verse4">Habakkuk&nbsp;2:4</a></span> and by which we walk without doubting while we are absent from the Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note121292"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> So long as this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> remains inviolate and firm, we may without blame entertain doubts regarding some things which we have neither perceived by sense nor by reason, and which have not been revealed to us by the canonical Scriptures, nor come to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through witnesses whom it is absurd to disbelieve.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; Of the Dress and Habits of the Christian People.</h2>

<p>It is a matter of no moment in the city of God whether he who adopts the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that brings men to God adopts it in one dress and manner of life or another, so long only as he lives in conformity with the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And hence, when <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> themselves become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, they are compelled, indeed, to abandon their erroneous doctrines, but not their dress and mode of living, which are no obstacle to religion. So that we make no account of that distinction of <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> which Varro adduced in connection with the Cynic school, provided always nothing indecent or self-indulgent is retained. As to these three modes of life, the contemplative, the active, and the composite, although, so long as a man's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is preserved, he may choose any of them without detriment to his <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> interests, yet he must never overlook the claims of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and duty. No man has a right to lead such a life of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> as to forget in his own ease the service due to his neighbor; nor has any man a right to be so immersed in active life as to neglect the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The charm of leisure must not be indolent vacancy of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but the investigation or discovery of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that thus every man may make solid attainments without grudging that others do the same. And, in active life, it is not the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> or power of this life we should <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>, since all things under the sun are vanity, but we should aim at using our position and influence, if these have been honorably attained, for the welfare of those who are under us, in the way we have already explained.  It is to this the apostle refers when he says, <q>He that desires the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> desires a good work.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121294"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:1</a></span> He wished to show that the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> is the title of a work, not of an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. It is a Greek word, and signifies that he who governs superintends or takes care of those whom he governs: for <span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x1F77;</span> means <em>over</em>, and <span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03BD;</span>, <em>to see</em>; therefore <span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03BD;</span> means <q>to oversee.</q>  So that he who loves to govern rather than to do good is no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Accordingly no one is prohibited from the search  after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for in this leisure may most laudably be spent; but it is unseemly to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> the high position requisite for governing the people, even though that position be held and that government be administered in a seemly manner. And therefore <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> leisure is longed for by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but it is the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to undertake requisite business. If no one imposes this burden upon us, we are free to sift and contemplate <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but if it be laid upon us, we are necessitated for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love's</a> sake to undertake it. And yet not even in this case are we <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> wholly to relinquish the sweets of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>; for were these to be withdrawn, the burden might prove more than we could bear.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; That the Saints are in This Life Blessed in Hope.</h2>

<p>Since, then, the supreme good of the city of God is perfect and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> peace, not such as mortals pass into and out of by birth and death, but the peace of freedom from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in which the immortals ever abide; who can deny that that future life is most blessed, or that, in comparison with it, this life which now we live is most wretched, be it filled with all blessings of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and external things? And yet, if any man uses this life with a reference to that other which he ardently loves and confidently hopes for, he may well be called even now blessed, though not in reality so much as in hope. But the actual possession of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of this life, without the hope of what is beyond, is but a false <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and profound misery. For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> blessings of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are not now enjoyed; for that is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom which does not direct all its <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> observations, manly actions, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> self-restraint, and just arrangements, to that end in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall be all and all in a secure <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and perfect peace.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.&mdash; Whether There Ever Was a Roman Republic Answering to the Definitions of Scipio in Cicero's Dialogue.</h2>

<p>This, then, is the place where I should fulfill the promise gave in the second book of this work,  and explain, as briefly and clearly as possible, that if we are to accept the definitions laid down by Scipio in Cicero's <em>De Republica</em>, there never was a Roman republic; for he briefly defines a republic as the good of the people. And if this definition be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, there never was a Roman republic, for the people's good was never attained among the Romans. For the people, according to his definition, is an assemblage associated by a common acknowledgment of right and by a community of interests. And what he means by a common acknowledgment of right he explains at large, showing that a republic cannot be administered without <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Where, therefore, there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> there can be no right. For that which is done by right is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> done, and what is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> done cannot be done by right. For the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> inventions of men are neither to be considered nor spoken of as rights; for even they themselves say that right is that which flows from the fountain of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and deny the definition which is commonly given by those who misconceive the matter, that right is that which is useful to the stronger party. Thus, where there is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> there can be no assemblage of men associated by a common acknowledgment of right, and therefore there can be no people, as defined by Scipio or Cicero; and if no people, then no good of the people, but only of some promiscuous multitude unworthy of the name of people. Consequently, if the republic is the good of the people, and there is no people if it be not associated by a common acknowledgment of right, and if there is no right where there is no <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, then most certainly it follows that there is no republic where there is no <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Further, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which gives every one his due. Where, then, is the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when he deserts the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and yields himself to impure <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>? Is this to give every one his due? Or is he who keeps back a piece of ground from the purchaser, and gives it to a man who has no right to it, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, while he who keeps back himself from the God who made him, and serves <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits, is just?</p>

<p>This same book, <em>De Republica</em>, advocates the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> against <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> with great force and keenness. The pleading for <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> against <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> was first heard, and it was asserted that without <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> a republic could neither increase nor even subsist, for it was laid down as an absolutely unassailable position that it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> for some men to rule and some to serve; and yet the imperial city to which the republic belongs cannot rule her provinces without having recourse to this <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. It was replied in behalf of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that this ruling of the provinces is just, because servitude may be advantageous to the provincials, and is so when rightly administered&mdash;that is to say, when lawless men are prevented from doing harm. And further, as they became worse and worse so long as they were free, they will  improve by subjection. To confirm this reasoning, there is added an eminent example drawn from nature: for <q>why,</q> it is asked, <q>does God rule man, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the body, the reason the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and other vicious parts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?</q> This example leaves no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that, to some, servitude is useful; and, indeed, to serve God is useful to all. And it is when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> serves God that it exercises a right control over the body; and in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself the reason must be subject to God if it is to govern as it ought the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. Hence, when a man does not serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> can we ascribe to him, since in this case his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot exercise a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> control over the body, nor his reason over his <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>? And if there is no <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in such an individual, certainly there can be none in a community composed of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Here, therefore, there is not that common acknowledgment of right which makes an assemblage of men a people whose affairs we call a republic. And why need I speak of the advantageousness, the common participation in which, according to the definition, makes a people? For although, if you choose to regard the matter attentively, you will see that there is nothing advantageous to those who live godlessly, as every one lives who does not serve God but <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> you may measure by their desire to receive the worship of men though they are most impure spirits, yet what I have said of the common acknowledgment of right is enough to demonstrate that, according to the above definition, there can be no people, and therefore no republic, where there is no <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For if they assert that in their republic the Romans did not serve unclean spirits, but good and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> gods, must we therefore again reply to this evasion, though already we have said enough, and more than enough, to expose it? He must be an uncommonly stupid, or a shamelessly contentious person, who has read through the foregoing books to this point, and can yet question whether the Romans served <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and impure <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. But, not to speak of their character, it is written in the law of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> unto any god save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121297"><a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;22:20</a></span> He, therefore, who uttered so menacing a commandment decreed that no worship should be given either to good or bad gods.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; Whether the God Whom the Christians Serve is the True God to Whom Alone Sacrifice Ought to Be Paid.</h2>

<p>But it may be replied, Who is this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or what <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is there that He alone is worthy to receive <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> from the Romans? One must be very blind to be still asking who this God is. He is the God whose <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> predicted the things we see accomplished. He is the God from whom <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> received the assurance, <q>In your seed shall all nations be blessed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121298"><a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse18">Genesis&nbsp;22:18</a></span> That this was fulfilled in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who according to the flesh sprang from that seed, is recognized, whether they will or no, even by those who have continued to be the enemies of this name. He is the God whose divine Spirit spoke by the men whose predictions I cited in the preceding books, and which are fulfilled in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which has extended over all the world. This is the God whom Varro, the most learned of the Romans, supposed to be Jupiter, though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what he says; yet I think it right to note the circumstance that a man of such learning was unable to suppose that this God had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> or was contemptible, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Him to be the same as the supreme God. In fine, He is the God whom Porphyry, the most learned of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, though the bitterest enemy of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, confesses to be a great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even according to the oracles of those whom he esteems gods.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.&mdash; Porphyry's Account of the Responses Given by the Oracles of the gods Concerning Christ.</h2>

<p>For in his book called <span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03BA; &#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B3;&#x1F77;&#x03C9;&#x03BD; &#x03C6;&#x03B9;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03C6;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>, in which he collects and comments upon the responses which he pretends were uttered by the gods concerning divine things, he says&mdash; I give his own words as they have been translated from the Greek: <q>To one who inquired what god he should propitiate in order to recall his wife from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, Apollo replied in the following verses.</q> Then the following words are given as those of Apollo: <q>You will probably find it easier to write lasting characters on the water, or lightly fly like a bird through the air, than to restore right feeling in your impious wife once she has polluted herself. Let her remain as she pleases in her foolish deception, and sing false laments to her dead <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who was condemned by right-minded judges, and perished ignominiously by a violent death.</q> Then after these verses of Apollo (which we have given in a Latin version that does not preserve the metrical form), he goes on to say: <q>In these verses Apollo exposed the incurable corruption of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, saying that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, rather than the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, recognized God.</q> See how he misrepresents  Christ, giving the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> the preference to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the recognition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This was his explanation of Apollo's verses, in which he says that Christ was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by right-minded or just judges,&mdash; in other words, that He deserved to die. I leave the responsibility of this oracle regarding Christ on the lying interpreter of Apollo, or on this <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it or possibly himself invented it; as to its agreement with Porphyry's opinions or with other oracles, we shall in a little have something to say. In this passage, however, he says that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as the interpreters of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, judged <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> in pronouncing Christ to be worthy of the most shameful death. He should have listened, then, to this God of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to whom he bears this testimony, when that God says, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to any other god save to the Lord alone shall be utterly destroyed.</q> But let us come to still plainer expressions, and hear how great a God Porphyry thinks the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> is. Apollo, he says, when asked whether word, <em> i.e</em>., reason, or law is the better thing, replied in the following verses. Then he gives the verses of Apollo, from which I select the following as sufficient: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Generator, and the King prior to all things, before whom heaven and earth, and the sea, and the hidden places of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> tremble, and the deities themselves are afraid, for their law is the Father whom the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Hebrews <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.</q> In this oracle of his god Apollo, Porphyry avowed that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the Hebrews is so great that the deities themselves are afraid before Him. I am surprised, therefore, that when God said, He that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to other gods shall be utterly destroyed, Porphyry himself was not afraid lest he should be destroyed for <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> to other gods.</p>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, however, has also some good to say of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, oblivious, as it were, of that contumely of his of which we have just been speaking; or as if his gods spoke <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of Christ only while asleep, and recognized Him to be good, and gave Him His deserved praise, when they awoke. For, as if he were about to proclaim some marvellous thing passing belief, he says, <q>What we are going to say will certainly take some by surprise. For the gods have declared that Christ was very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and has become <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and that they cherish his memory: that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, however, are polluted, contaminated, and involved in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. And many other such things,</q> he says, <q>do the gods say against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</q> Then he gives specimens of the accusations made, as he says, by the gods against them, and then goes on: <q>But to some who asked Hecate whether Christ were a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, she replied, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the condition of the disembodied <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and that if it has been severed from wisdom it always <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> you refer to is that of a man foremost in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>: they worship it because they mistake the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> To this so-called oracular response he adds the following words of his own: <q>Of this very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man, then, Hecate said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, like the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of other good men, was after death dowered with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> worship it. And to those who ask why he was condemned to die, the oracle of the goddess replied, The body, indeed, is always exposed to torments, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> abide in heaven. And the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> you inquire about has been the fatal <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to other <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which were not fated to receive the gifts of the gods, and to have the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> Jove. Such <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are therefore <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by the gods; for they who were fated not to receive the gifts of the gods, and not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were fated to be involved in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by means of him you speak of. He himself, however, was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and heaven has been opened to him as to other good men. You are not, then, to speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of him, but to pity the folly of men: and through him men's danger is imminent.</q></p>

<p>Who is so foolish as not to see that these oracles were either composed by a clever man with a strong animus against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, or were uttered as responses by impure <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> with a similar design&mdash;that is to say, in order that their praise of Christ may win credence for their vituperation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; and that thus they may, if possible, close the way of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which is identical with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>? For they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they are by no means counter working their own hurtful craft by promoting belief in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so long as their <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniation</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> is also accepted; for they thus secure that even the man who thinks well of Christ declines to become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and is therefore not delivered from their own rule by the Christ he praises. Besides, their praise of Christ is so contrived that whosoever believes in Him as thus represented will not be a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> but a Photinian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, recognizing only the humanity, and not also the divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and will thus be precluded from <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and from deliverance out of the meshes of these devilish lies. For our part, we are no better pleased with Hecate's praises of Christ than with Apollo's <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniation</a> of Him. Apollo says that Christ was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by right-minded judges, implying that  He was unrighteous. Hecate says that He was a most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man, but no more. The intention of both is the same, to prevent men from becoming <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, because if this be secured, men shall never be rescued from their power. But it is incumbent on our <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, or rather on those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in these pretended oracles against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, first of all, if they can, to bring Apollo and Hecate to the same mind regarding Christ, so that either both may condemn or both praise Him. And even if they succeeded in this, we for our part would notwithstanding repudiate the testimony of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, whether favorable or adverse to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But when our adversaries find a god and goddess of their own at variance about Christ the one praising, the other vituperating Him, they can certainly give no credence, if they have any judgment, to mere men who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</p>

<p>When Porphyry or Hecate praises Christ, and adds that He gave Himself to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as a fatal gift, that they might be involved in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, he exposes, as he thinks, the causes of this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. But before I cite his words to that purpose, I would ask, If Christ did thus give Himself to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to involve them in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, did He do so willingly, or against His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>? If willingly, how is He righteous? If against His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, how is He blessed? However, let us hear the causes of this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. <q>There are,</q> he says, in a certain place very small earthly spirits, subject to the power of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. The wise men of the Hebrews, among whom was this Jesus, as you have heard from the oracles of Apollo cited above, turned religious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> from these very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and minor spirits, and taught them rather to worship the celestial gods, and especially to adore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. This, he said, <q>the gods enjoin; and we have already shown how they admonish the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and command it to worship Him. But the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and the ungodly, who are not destined to receive favors from the gods, nor to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> Jupiter, not listening to the gods and their messages, have turned away from all gods, and have not only refused to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, but have venerated the prohibited <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Professing to worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they refuse to do those things by which alone God is worshipped. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, indeed, being the Father of all, is in need of nothing; but for us it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to adore Him by means of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and thus to make life itself a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to Him, by inquiring into and imitating His nature. For inquiry,</q> says he, <q>purifies and imitation deifies us, by moving us nearer to Him.</q> He is right in so far as he proclaims <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the conduct by which we should worship Him. Of such precepts the prophetic books of the Hebrews are full, when they praise or blame the life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. But in speaking of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> he is in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and caluminates them as much as is desired by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> whom he takes for gods, as if it were difficult for any man to recollect the disgraceful and shameful actions which used to be done in the theatres and temples to please the gods, and to compare with these things what is heard in our churches, and what is offered to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and from this comparison to conclude where character is edified, and where it is ruined. But who but a diabolical spirit has told or suggested to this man so manifest and vain a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, as that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> reverenced rather than <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, whose worship the Hebrews prohibited? But that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom the Hebrew sages worshipped, forbids <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to be offered even to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of heaven and divine powers, whom we, in this our pilgrimage, venerate and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> as our most blessed fellow citizens. For in the law which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave to His Hebrew people He utters this menace, as in a voice of thunder: <q>He that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121299"><a href="../bible/exo022.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;22:20</a></span> And that no one might suppose that this prohibition extends only to the very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and earthly spirits, whom this <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> calls very small and inferior&mdash;for even these are in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> called gods, not of the Hebrews, but of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> translators have shown in the psalm where it is said, <q>For all the gods of the nations are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>,</q> &mdash; that no one might suppose, I say, that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to these <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> was prohibited, but that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> might be offered to all or some of the celestials, it was immediately added, <q>save unto the Lord alone.</q>  The God of the Hebrews, then, to whom this renowned <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> bears this signal testimony, gave to His Hebrew people a law, composed in the Hebrew language, and not obscure and unknown, but published now in every nation, and in this law it is written, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> unto any god, save unto the Lord alone, he shall be utterly destroyed.</q> What need is there to seek further <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> in the law or the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of this same thing? <em>Seek</em>, we need not say, for the passages are neither few nor difficult to find; but what need to collect and apply to my argument the  <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> which are thickly sown and obvious, and by which it appears clear as day that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> may be paid to none but the supreme and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God? Here is one brief but decided, even menacing, and certainly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> utterance of that God whom the wisest of our adversaries so highly extol. Let this be listened to, feared, fulfilled, that there may be no disobedient <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cut off. <q>He that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>,</q> He says, not because He needs anything, but because it behooves us to be His possession. Hence the Psalmist in the Hebrew Scriptures sings, <q>I have said to the Lord, You are my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for You need not my good.</q>  For we ourselves, who are His own city, are His most noble and worthy <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and it is this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> we celebrate in our <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, which are well known to the faithful, as we have explained in the preceding books. For through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> the oracles of God declared that the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> offered as a shadow of that which was to be would cease, and that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, from the rising to the setting of the sun, would offer one <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. From these oracles, which we now see accomplished, we have made such selections as seemed suitable to our purpose in this work. And therefore, where there is not this righteousness whereby the one supreme God rules the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> city according to His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, so that it <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to none but Him, and whereby, in all the citizens of this <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> city, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> consequently rules the body and reason the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> in the rightful order, so that, as the individual just man, so also the community and people of the just, live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> whereby man loves God as He ought to be loved, and his neighbor as himself&mdash;there, I say, there is not an assemblage associated by a common acknowledgment of right, and by a community of interests. But if there is not this, there is not a people, if our definition be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and therefore there is no republic; for where there is no people there can be no republic.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.&mdash; The Definition Which Must Be Given of a People and a Republic, in Order to Vindicate the Assumption of These Titles by the Romans and by Other Kingdoms.</h2>

<p>But if we discard this definition of a people, and, assuming another, say that a people is an assemblage of reasonable beings bound together by a common agreement as to the objects of their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, then, in order to discover the character of any people, we have only to observe what they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Yet whatever it loves, if only it is an assemblage of reasonable beings and not of beasts, and is bound together by an agreement as to the objects of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, it is reasonably called a people; and it will be a superior people in proportion as it is bound together by higher interests, inferior in proportion as it is bound together by lower. According to this definition of ours, the Roman people is a people, and its good is without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> a commonwealth or republic. But what its tastes were in its early and subsequent days, and how it declined into sanguinary seditions and then to social and civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and so burst asunder or rotted off the bond of concord in which the health of a people consists, history shows, and in the preceding books I have related at large. And yet I would not on this account say either that it was not a people, or that its administration was not a republic, so long as there remains an assemblage of reasonable beings bound together by a common agreement as to the objects of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. But what I say of this people and of this republic I must be understood to think and say of the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> or any Greek state, of the Egyptians, of the early Assyrian <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and of every other nation, great or small, which had a public government. For, in general, the city of the ungodly, which did not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the command of God that it should offer no <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> save to Him alone, and which, therefore, could not give to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> its proper command over the body, nor to the reason its just authority over the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, is void of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25.&mdash; That Where There is No True Religion There are No True Virtues.</h2>

<p>For though the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may seem to rule the body admirably, and the reason the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and reason do not themselves <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as God has commanded them to serve Him, they have no proper authority over the body and the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. For what kind of mistress of the body and the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> can that mind be which is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which, instead of being subject to His authority, is prostituted to the corrupting influences of the most vicious <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>? It is for this reason that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which it seems to itself to possess, and by which it restrains the body and the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> that it may obtain and keep what it desires, are rather <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> than <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> so long as there is no reference to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the matter. For although some suppose that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which have a reference only to themselves, and are desired only on their own account, are yet <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and genuine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, the fact is that even then they are inflated with  <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and are therefore to be reckoned <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For as that which gives life to the flesh is not derived from flesh, but is above it, so that which gives blessed life to man is not derived from man, but is something above him; and what I say of man is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of every celestial power and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> whatsoever.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.&mdash; Of the Peace Which is Enjoyed by the People that are Alienated from God, and the Use Made of It by the People of God in the Time of Its Pilgrimage.</h2>

<p>Wherefore, as the life of the flesh is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so the blessed life of man is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of whom the sacred writings of the Hebrews say, <q>Blessed is the people whose God is the Lord.</q>  Miserable, therefore, is the people which is alienated from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Yet even this people has a peace of its own which is not to be lightly esteemed, though, indeed, it shall not in the end enjoy it, because it makes no good use of it before the end. But it is our interest that it enjoy this peace meanwhile in this life; for as long as the two cities are commingled, we also enjoy the peace of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>. For from <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> the people of God is so freed that it meanwhile sojourns in its company. And therefore the apostle also admonished the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for kings and those in authority, assigning as the reason, <q>that we may live a quiet and tranquil life in all godliness and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q>  And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah, when predicting the captivity that was to befall the ancient people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and giving them the divine command to go obediently to Babylonia, and thus serve their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, counselled them also to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for Babylonia, saying, <q>In the peace thereof shall you have peace,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121305"><a href="../bible/jer029.htm#verse7">Jeremiah&nbsp;29:7</a></span> &mdash; the temporal peace which the good and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> together enjoy.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27.&mdash; That the Peace of Those Who Serve God Cannot in This Mortal Life Be Apprehended in Its Perfection.</h2>

<p>But the peace which is peculiar to ourselves we enjoy now with God by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and shall hereafter enjoy <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> with Him by sight. But the peace which we enjoy in this life, whether common to all or peculiar to ourselves, is rather the solace of our misery than the positive enjoyment of felicity. Our very righteousness, too, though <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in so far as it has respect to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> good, is yet in this life of such a kind that it consists rather in the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> than in the perfecting of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. Witness the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the whole city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in its pilgrim state, for it cries to God by the mouth of all its members, <q>Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121306"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> And this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is efficacious not for those whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <q>without works and dead,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121307"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse17">James&nbsp;2:17</a></span> but for those whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <q>works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121308"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> For as reason, though subjected to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is yet <q>pressed down by the corruptible body,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121309"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span> so long as it is in this mortal condition, it has not perfect authority over <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and therefore this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is needed by the righteous. For though it exercises authority, the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> do not submit without a struggle. For however well one maintains the conflict, and however thoroughly he has subdued these enemies, there steals in some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing, which, if it does not find ready expression in act, slips out by the lips, or insinuates itself into the thought; and therefore his peace is not full so long as he is at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with his <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. For it is a doubtful conflict he wages with those that resist, and his victory over those that are defeated is not secure, but full of anxiety and effort. Amidst these <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, therefore, of all which it has been summarily said in the divine oracles, <q>Is not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life upon earth a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121310"><a href="../bible/job007.htm#verse1">Job&nbsp;7:1</a></span> who but a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> man can presume that he so lives that he has no need to say to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>Forgive us our debts?</q> And such a man is not great, but swollen and puffed up with vanity, and is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> resisted by Him who abundantly gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>. Whence it is said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> resists the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, but gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>.</q>  In this, then, consists the righteousness of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that he submit himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his body to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, even when they rebel, to his reason, which either defeats or at least resists them; and also that he beg from God <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to do his duty,  and the pardon of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and that he render to God thanks for all the blessings he receives. But, in that final peace to which all our righteousness has reference, and for the sake of which it is maintained, as our nature shall enjoy a sound <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and incorruption, and shall have no more <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and as we shall experience no resistance either from ourselves or from others, it will not be necessary that reason should rule <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> which no longer exist, but God shall rule the man, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall rule the body, with a sweetness and facility suitable to the felicity of a life which is done with bondage. And this condition shall there  be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and we shall be assured of its <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; and thus the peace of this blessedness and the blessedness of this peace shall be the supreme good.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28.&mdash; The End of the Wicked.</h2>

<p>But, on the other hand, they who do not belong to this city of God shall inherit <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> misery, which is also called the second death, because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall then be separated from God its life, and therefore cannot be said to live, and the body shall be subjected to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> pains. And consequently this second death shall be the more severe, because no death shall terminate it. But <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> being contrary to peace, as misery to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and life to death, it is not without reason asked what kind of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> can be found in the end of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> answering to the peace which is declared to be the end of the righteous? The person who puts this question has only to observe what it is in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that is hurtful and destructive, and he shall see that it is nothing else than the mutual opposition and conflict of things. And can he conceive a more grievous and bitter <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> than that in which the will is so opposed to passion, and passion to the will, that their hostility can never be terminated by the victory of either, and in which the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of pain so conflicts with the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body, that neither yields to the other? For in this life, when this conflict has arisen, either pain conquers and death expels the feeling of it, or nature conquers and health expels the pain. But in the world to come the pain continues that it may torment, and the nature endures that it may be sensible of it; and neither ceases to exist, lest punishment also should cease. Now, as it is through the last judgment that men pass to these ends, the good to the supreme good, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to the supreme <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, I will treat of this judgment in the following book.</p>
