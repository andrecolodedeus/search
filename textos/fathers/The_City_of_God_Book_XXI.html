<h1>The City of God (Book XXI)</h1>

<p class="h1a">Of the end reserved for the city of the devil, namely, the eternal punishment of the damned; and of the arguments which unbelief brings against it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; Of the Order of the Discussion, Which Requires that We First Speak of the Eternal Punishment of the Lost in Company with the Devil, and Then of the Eternal Happiness of the Saints.</h2>

<p>I Propose, with such ability as God may grant me, to discuss in this book more thoroughly the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the punishment which shall be assigned to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and all his retainers, when the two cities, the one of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, shall have reached their proper ends through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, the Judge of quick and dead. And I have adopted this order, and preferred to speak, first of the punishment of the devils, and afterwards of the blessedness of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, because the body partakes of either destiny; and it seems to be more incredible that bodies endure in everlasting torments than that they continue to exist without any pain in everlasting felicity. Consequently, when I shall have demonstrated that that punishment ought not to be incredible, this will materially aid me in proving that which is much more credible, viz., the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> which are delivered from all pain. Neither is this order out of harmony with the divine writings, in which sometimes, indeed, the blessedness of the good is placed first, as in the words, <q>They that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, unto the resurrection of judgment;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121493"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;5:29</a></span> but sometimes also last, as, <q>The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall send forth His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all things which offend, and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth, Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of His Father;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121494"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;13:41-43</a></span> and that, <q>These shall go away into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, but the righteous into life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121495"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;25:46</a></span> And though we have not room to cite instances, any one who examines the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> will find that they adopt now the one arrangement and now the other. My own reason for following the latter order I have given.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; Whether It is Possible for Bodies to Last for Ever in Burning Fire.</h2>

<p>What, then, can I adduce to convince those who refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies, animated and living, can not only survive death, but also last in the torments of everlasting fires? They will not allow us to refer this simply to the power of the Almighty, but demand that we persuade them by some example. If, then, we reply to them, that there are animals which certainly are corruptible, because they are mortal, and which yet live in the midst of flames; and likewise, that in springs of water so hot that no one can put his hand in it with impunity a species of worm is found, which not only lives there, but cannot live elsewhere; they either refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> these facts unless we can show them, or, if we are in circumstances to prove them by ocular demonstration or by adequate testimony, they contend, with the same scepticism, that these facts are not examples of what we seek to prove, inasmuch as these animals do not live for ever, and besides, they live in that  blaze of heat without pain, the element of fire being congenial to their nature, and causing it to thrive and not to suffer&mdash;just as if it were not more incredible that it should thrive than that it should suffer in such circumstances. It is strange that anything should suffer in fire and yet live, but stranger that it should live in fire and not suffer. If, then, the latter be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, why not also the former?</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; Whether Bodily Suffering Necessarily Terminates in the Destruction of the Flesh.</h2>

<p>But, say they, there is no body which can suffer and cannot also die. How do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this? For who can say with certainty that the devils do not suffer in their bodies, when they own that they are grievously tormented? And if it is replied that there is no earthly body&mdash; that is to say, no solid and perceptible body, or, in one word, no flesh&mdash; which can suffer and cannot die, is not this to tell us only what men have gathered from experience and their bodily senses? For they indeed have no acquaintance with any flesh but that which is mortal; and this is their whole argument, that what they have had no experience of they judge quite impossible. For we cannot call it reasoning to make pain a presumption of death, while, in fact, it is rather a sign of life. For though it be a question whether that which suffers can continue to live for ever, yet it is certain that everything which suffers pain does live, and that pain can exist only in a living subject. It is necessary, therefore, that he who is pained be living, not necessary that pain kill him; for every pain does not kill even those mortal bodies of ours which are destined to die. And that any pain kills them is caused by the circumstance that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is so connected with the body that it succumbs to great pain and withdraws; for the structure of our members and vital parts is so infirm that it cannot bear up against that <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> which causes great or extreme agony. But in the life to come this connection of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body is of such a kind, that as it is dissolved by no lapse of time, so neither is it burst asunder by any pain. And so, although it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in this world there is no flesh which can suffer pain and yet cannot die, yet in the world to come there shall be flesh such as now there is not, as there will also be death such as now there is not. For death will not be abolished, but will be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will neither be able to enjoy God and live, nor to die and escape the pains of the body. The first death drives the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the body against her will: the second death holds the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the body against her will. The two have this in common, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffers against her will what her own body inflicts.</p>

<p>Our opponents, too, make much of this, that in this world there is no flesh which can suffer pain and cannot die; while they make nothing of the fact that there is something which is greater than the body. For the spirit, whose presence animates and rules the body, can both suffer pain and cannot die. Here then is something which, though it can feel pain, is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. And this capacity, which we now see in the spirit of all, shall be hereafter in the bodies of the damned. Moreover, if we attend to the matter a little more closely, we see that what is called bodily pain is rather to be referred to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For it is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> not the body, which is pained, even when the pain originates with the body&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> feeling pain at the point where the body is hurt. As then we speak of bodies feeling and living, though the feeling and life of the body are from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so also we speak of bodies being pained, though no pain can be suffered by the body apart from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, then, is pained with the body in that part where something occurs to hurt it; and it is pained alone, though it be in the body, when some invisible <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> distresses it, while the body is safe and sound. Even when not associated with the body it is pained; for certainly that rich man was suffering in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> when he cried, <q>I am tormented in this flame.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121496"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse24">Luke&nbsp;16:24</a></span> But as for the body, it suffers no pain when it is soulless; and even when animate it can suffer only by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> suffering. If, therefore, we might draw a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> presumption from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of pain to that of death, and conclude that where pain can be felt death can occur, death would rather be the property of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for to it pain more peculiarly belongs. But, seeing that that which suffers most cannot die, what ground is there for supposing that those bodies, because destined to suffer, are therefore, destined to die? The Platonists indeed maintained that these earthly bodies and dying members gave rise to the fears, desires, griefs, and joys of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <q>Hence,</q> says Virgil (<em>i.e</em>., from these earthly bodies and dying members),</p>

<blockquote><p>Hence wild desires and grovelling fears,
<br>And <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laughter, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> tears. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>But in the fourteenth book of this work  we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that, according to the Platonists' own theory, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, even when purged from all pollution of the body, are yet possessed  by a monstrous desire to return again into their bodies. But where desire can exist, certainly pain also can exist; for desire frustrated, either by missing what it aims at or losing what it had attained, is turned into pain. And therefore, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is either the only or the chief sufferer, has yet a kind of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of its own, it is inconsequent to say that because the bodies of the damned shall suffer pain, therefore they shall die. In fine, if the body causes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to suffer, why can the body not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> death as well as suffering, unless because it does not follow that what causes pain causes death as well? And why then is it incredible that these fires can <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pain but not death to those bodies we speak of, just as the bodies themselves <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pain, but not therefore death, to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>? Pain is therefore no necessary presumption of death.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; Examples from Nature Proving that Bodies May Remain Unconsumed and Alive in Fire.</h2>

<p>If, therefore, the salamander lives in fire, as naturalists  have recorded, and if certain famous mountains of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> have been continually on fire from the remotest antiquity until now, and yet remain entire, these are sufficiently convincing examples that everything which burns is not consumed. As the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> too, is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that not everything which can suffer pain can also die, why then do they yet demand that we produce real examples to prove that it is not incredible that the bodies of men condemned to everlasting punishment may retain their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the fire, may burn without being consumed, and may suffer without perishing? For suitable properties will be communicated to the substance of the flesh by Him who has endowed the things we see with so marvellous and diverse properties, that their very multitude prevents our wonder. For who but God the Creator of all things has given to the flesh of the peacock its antiseptic property? This property, when I first heard of it, seemed to me incredible; but it happened at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> that a bird of this kind was cooked and served up to me, and, taking a suitable slice of flesh from its breast, I ordered it to be kept, and when it had been kept as many days as make any other flesh stinking, it was produced and set before me, and emitted no offensive smell. And after it had been laid by for thirty days and more, it was still in the same state; and a year after, the same still, except that it was a little more shrivelled, and drier. Who gave to chaff such power to freeze that it preserves snow buried under it, and such power to warm that it ripens green fruit?</p>

<p>But who can explain the strange properties of fire itself, which blackens everything it burns, though itself bright; and which, though of the most beautiful colors, discolors almost all it touches and feeds upon, and turns blazing fuel into grimy cinders? Still this is not laid down as an absolutely uniform law; for, on the contrary, stones baked in glowing fire themselves also glow, and though the fire be rather of a red hue, and they white, yet white is congruous with light, and black with darkness. Thus, though the fire burns the wood in calcining the stones, these contrary effects do not result from the contrariety of the materials. For though wood and stone differ, they are not contraries, like black and white, the one of which colors is produced in the stones, while the other is produced in the wood by the same action of fire, which imparts its own brightness to the former, while it begrimes the latter, and which could have no effect on the one were it not fed by the other. Then what wonderful properties do we find in charcoal, which is so brittle that a light tap breaks it and a slight pressure pulverizes it, and yet is so strong that no moisture rots it, nor any time causes it to decay. So enduring is it, that it is customary in laying down landmarks to put charcoal underneath them, so that if, after the longest interval, any one raises an action, and pleads that there is no boundary stone, he may be convicted by the charcoal below. What then has enabled it to last so long without rotting, though buried in the damp earth in which [its original] wood rots, except this same fire which consumes all things?</p>

<p>Again, let us consider the wonders of lime; for besides growing white in fire, which makes other things black, and of which I have already said enough, it has also a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> property of conceiving fire within it. Itself cold to the touch, it yet has a hidden store of fire, which is not at once apparent to our senses, but which experience teaches us, lies as it were slumbering within it even while unseen. And it is for this reason called <q>quick lime,</q> as if the fire were the invisible <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> quickening the visible substance or body. But the marvellous thing is, that this fire is kindled when it is extinguished. For to disengage the hidden fire the lime is moistened or drenched with water, and then, though it be cold before, it becomes hot by that very application which cools what is hot. As if the  fire were departing from the lime and breathing its last, it no longer lies hid, but appears; and then the lime lying in the coldness of death cannot be requickened, and what we before called <q>quick,</q> we now call <q>slaked.</q> What can be stranger than this? Yet there is a greater marvel still. For if you treat the lime, not with water, but with oil, which is as fuel to fire, no amount of oil will heat it. Now if this marvel had been told us of some Indian mineral which we had no opportunity of experimenting upon, we should either have immediately pronounced it a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, or certainly should have been greatly astonished. But things that daily present themselves to our own observation we despise, not because they are really less marvellous, but because they are common; so that even some products of India itself, remote as it is from ourselves, cease to excite our admiration as soon as we can admire them at our leisure. </p>

<p>The diamond is a stone possessed by many among ourselves, especially by jewellers and lapidaries, and the stone is so hard that it can be wrought neither by iron nor fire, nor, they say, by anything at all except goat's blood. But do you suppose it is as much admired by those who own it and are familiar with its properties as by those to whom it is shown for the first time? Persons who have not seen it perhaps do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what is said of it, or if they do, they wonder as at a thing beyond their experience; and if they happen to see it, still they marvel because they are unused to it, but gradually familiar experience [of it] dulls their admiration. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the loadstone has a wonderful power of attracting iron. When I first saw it I was thunderstruck, for I saw an iron ring attracted and suspended by the stone; and then, as if it had communicated its own property to the iron it attracted, and had made it a substance like itself, this ring was put near another, and lifted it up; and as the first ring clung to the magnet, so did the second ring to the first. A third and a fourth were similarly added, so that there hung from the stone a kind of chain of rings, with their hoops connected, not interlinking, but attached together by their outer surface. Who would not be amazed at this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the stone, subsisting as it does not only in itself, but transmitted through so many suspended rings, and binding them together by invisible links? Yet far more astonishing is what I heard about this stone from my brother in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, Severus <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Milevis. He told me that Bathanarius, once count of Africa, when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was dining with him, produced a magnet, and held it under a silver plate on which he placed a bit of iron; then as he moved his hand with the magnet underneath the plate, the iron upon the plate moved about accordingly. The intervening silver was not affected at all, but precisely as the magnet was moved backwards and forwards below it, no matter how quickly, so was the iron attracted above. I have related what I myself have witnessed; I have related what I was told by one whom I trust as I trust my own eyes. Let me further say what I have read about this magnet. When a diamond is laid near it, it does not lift iron; or if it has already lifted it, as soon as the diamond approaches, it drops it. These stones come from India. But if we cease to admire them because they are now familiar, how much less must they admire them who procure them very easily and send them to us? Perhaps they are held as cheap as we hold lime, which, because it is common, we think nothing of, though it has the strange property of burning when water, which is wont to quench fire, is poured on it, and of remaining cool when mixed with oil, which ordinarily feeds fire.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; That There are Many Things Which Reason Cannot Account For, and Which are Nevertheless True.</h2>

<p>Nevertheless, when we declare the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has wrought, or will yet work, and which we cannot bring under the very eyes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, sceptics keep demanding that we shall explain these marvels to reason. And because we cannot do so, inasmuch as they are above <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> comprehension, they suppose we are speaking <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>. These <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> themselves, therefore, ought to account for all these marvels which we either can or do see. And if they perceive that this is impossible for man to do, they should acknowledge that it cannot be concluded that a thing has not been or shall not be because it cannot be reconciled to reason, since there are things now in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of which the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. I will not, then, detail the multitude of marvels which are related in books, and which refer not to things that happened once and passed away, but that are permanent in certain places, where, if any one has the desire and opportunity, he may ascertain their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but a few only I recount. The following are some of the marvels men tell us:&mdash; The <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> of Agrigentum in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, when thrown into the  fire, becomes fluid as if it were in water, but in the water it crackles as if it were in the fire. The Garamant&aelig; have a fountain so cold by day that no one can drink it, so hot by night no one can touch it.  In Epirus, too, there is a fountain which, like all others, quenches lighted torches, but, unlike all others, lights quenched torches. There is a stone found in Arcadia, and called asbestos, because once lit it cannot be put out. The wood of a certain kind of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> fig-tree sinks in water, and does not float like other wood; and, stranger still, when it has been sunk to the bottom for some time, it rises again to the surface, though nature requires that when soaked in water it should be heavier than ever. Then there are the apples of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> which grow indeed to an appearance of ripeness, but, when you touch them with hand or tooth, the peal cracks, and they crumble into dust and ashes. The Persian stone pyrites burns the hand when it is tightly held in it and so gets its name from fire. In <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> too, there is found another stone called selenite, because its interior brilliancy waxes and wanes with the moon. Then in Cappadocia the mares are impregnated by the wind, and their foals live only three years. Tilon, an Indian island, has this advantage over all other lands, that no tree which grows in it ever loses its foliage.</p>

<p>These and numberless other marvels recorded in the history, not of past events, but of permanent localities, I have no time to enlarge upon and diverge from my main object; but let those sceptics who refuse to credit the divine writings give me, if they can, a rational account of them. For their only ground of unbelief in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> is, that they contain incredible things, just such as I have been recounting. For, say they, reason cannot admit that flesh burn and remain unconsumed, suffer without dying. Mighty reasoners, indeed, who are competent to give the reason of all the marvels that exist! Let them then give us the reason of the few things we have cited, and which, if they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, and were only assured by us they would at some future time occur, they would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> still less than that which they now refuse to credit on our word. For which of them would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> us if, instead of saying that the living bodies of men hereafter will be such as to endure everlasting pain and fire without ever dying, we were to say that in the world to come there will be <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> which becomes liquid in fire as if it were in water, and crackles in water as if it were in fire; or that there will be a fountain whose water in the chill air of night is so hot that it cannot be touched, while in the heat of day it is so cold that it cannot be drunk; or that there will be a stone which by its own heat burns the hand when tightly held, or a stone which cannot be extinguished if it has been lit in any part; or any of those wonders I have cited, while omitting numberless others? If we were to say that these things would be found in the world to come, and our sceptics were to reply, <q>If you wish us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> these things, satisfy our reason about each of them,</q> we should confess that we could not, because the frail comprehension of man cannot master these and such-like wonders of God's working; and that yet our reason was thoroughly convinced that the Almighty does nothing without reason, though the frail mind of man cannot explain the reason; and that while we are in many instances uncertain what He intends, yet that it is always most certain that nothing which He intends is impossible to Him; and that when He declares His <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him whom we cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be either powerless or false. Nevertheless these cavillers at <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and exactors of reason, how do they dispose of those things of which a reason cannot be given, and which yet exist, though in apparent contrariety to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things? If we had announced that these things were to be, these sceptics would have demanded from us the reason of them, as they do in the case of those things which we are announcing as destined to be. And consequently, as these present marvels are not non-existent, though <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reason and discourse are lost in such works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so those things we speak of are not impossible because inexplicable; for in this particular they are in the same predicament as the marvels of earth.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; That All Marvels are Not of Nature's Production, But that Some are Due to Human Ingenuity and Others to Diabolic Contrivance.</h2>

<p>At this point they will perhaps reply, <q>These things have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; we don't <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> one of them; they are travellers' tales and fictitious romances;</q> and they may add what has the appearance of argument, and say, <q>If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> such things as these, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what is recorded in the same books, that there was or is a temple of Venus in which a candelabrum set in the open air holds a lamp, which burns so strongly that no storm  or rain extinguishes it, and which is therefore called, like the stone mentioned above, the asbestos or inextinguishable lamp.</q> They may say this with the intention of putting us into a dilemma: for if we say this is incredible, then we shall impugn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the other recorded marvels; if, on the other hand, we admit that this is credible, we shall avouch the pagan deities. But, as I have already said in the eighteenth book of this work, we do not hold it necessary to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> all that profane history contains, since, as Varro says, even historians themselves disagree on so many points, that one would think they intended and were at pains to do so; but we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, if we are disposed, those things which are not contradicted by these books, which we do not hesitate to say we are bound to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. But as to those permanent <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of nature, whereby we wish to persuade the sceptical of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the world to come, those are quite sufficient for our purpose which we ourselves can observe or of which it is not difficult to find trustworthy witnesses. Moreover, that temple of Venus, with its inextinguishable lamp, so far from hemming us into a corner, opens an advantageous field to our argument. For to this inextinguishable lamp we add a host of marvels wrought by men, or by magic,&mdash; that is, by men under the influence of devils, or by the devils directly&mdash;for such marvels we cannot deny without impugning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the sacred Scriptures we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. That lamp, therefore, was either by some mechanical and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> device fitted with asbestos, or it was arranged by magical art in order that the worshippers might be astonished, or some <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> under the name of Venus so signally manifested himself that this prodigy both began and became permanent. Now devils are attracted to dwell in certain temples by means of the creatures (God's creatures, not theirs), who present to them what suits their various tastes. They are attracted not by food like animals, but, like spirits, by such <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> as suit their taste, various kinds of stones, woods, plants, animals, songs, <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. And that men may provide these attractions, the devils first of all cunningly seduce them, either by imbuing their hearts with a secret poison, or by revealing themselves under a friendly guise, and thus make a few of them their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who become the instructors of the multitude. For unless they first instructed men, it were impossible to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what each of them desires, what they shrink from, by what name they should be invoked or constrained to be present. Hence the origin of magic and magicians. But, above all, they possess the hearts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and are chiefly <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of this possession when they transform themselves into <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of light. Very many things that occur, therefore, are their doing; and these <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of theirs we ought all the more carefully to shun as we acknowledge them to be very surprising. And yet these very <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> forward my present arguments. For if such marvels are wrought by unclean devils, how much mightier are the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>! And what can not that God do who made the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> themselves capable of working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>!</p>

<p>If, then, very many effects can be contrived by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> art, of so surprising a kind that the uninitiated think them divine, as when, <em>e.g</em>., in a certain temple two magnets have been adjusted, one in the roof, another in the floor, so that an iron image is suspended in mid-air between them, one would suppose by the power of the divinity, were he <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the magnets above and beneath; or, as in the case of that lamp of Venus which we already mentioned as being a skillful adaptation of asbestos; if, again, by the help of magicians, whom Scripture calls sorcerers and enchanters, the devils could gain such power that the noble poet Virgil should consider himself justified in describing a very powerful magician in these lines:</p>

<blockquote><p>Her charms can cure what <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> she please,

<br>Rob other hearts of healthful ease,

<br>Turn rivers backward to their source,

<br>And make the stars forget their course,

<br>And call up ghosts from night:

<br>The ground shall bellow 'neath your feet:

<br>The mountain-ash shall quit its seat,

<br>And travel down the height; &mdash;
</p></blockquote>

<p>if this be so, how much more able is God to do those things which to sceptics are incredible, but to His power easy, since it is He who has given to stones and all other things their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and to men their skill to use them in wonderful ways; He who has given to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> a nature more mighty than that of all that lives on earth; He whose power surpasses all marvels, and whose wisdom in working, ordaining, and permitting is no less marvellous in its governance of all things than in its creation of all!</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; That the Ultimate Reason for Believing Miracles is the Omnipotence of the Creator.</h2>

<p>Why, then, cannot God effect both that the bodies of the dead shall rise, and that the bodies of the damned shall be tormented in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>&mdash;<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made the world  full of countless <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in sky, earth, air, and waters, while itself is a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> unquestionably greater and more admirable than all the marvels it is filled with? But those with whom or against whom we are arguing, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> both that there is a God who made the world, and that there are gods created by Him who administer the world's <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as His viceregents,&mdash; our adversaries, I say, who, so far from denying emphatically, assert that there are powers in the world which effect marvellous results (whether of their own accord, or because they are invoked by some rite or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, or in some magical way), when we lay before them the wonderful properties of other things which are neither rational animals nor rational spirits, but such material objects as those we have just cited, are in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of replying, This is their natural property, their nature; these are the powers naturally belonging to them. Thus the whole reason why Agrigentine <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> dissolves in fire and crackles in water is that this is its nature. Yet this seems rather contrary to nature, which has given not to fire but to water the power of melting <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, and the power of scorching it not to water but to fire. But this they say, is the natural property of <em>this</em> <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, to show effects contrary to these. The same reason, therefore, is assigned to account for that Garamantian fountain, of which one and the same runlet is chill by day and boiling by night, so that in either extreme it cannot be touched. So also of that other fountain which, though it is cold to the touch, and though it, like other fountains, extinguishes a lighted torch, yet, unlike other fountains, and in a surprising manner, kindles an extinguished torch. So of the asbestos stone, which, though it has no heat of its own, yet when kindled by fire applied to it, cannot be extinguished. And so of the rest, which I am weary of reciting, and in which, though there seems to be an extraordinary property contrary to nature, yet no other reason is given for them than this, that this is their nature,&mdash; a brief reason <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, and, I own, a satisfactory reply. But since God is the author of all natures, how is it that our adversaries, when they refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what we affirm, on the ground that it is impossible, are unwilling to accept from us a better explanation than their own, viz., that this is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;for certainly He is called Almighty only because He is mighty to do all He will&mdash;He who was able to create so many marvels, not only unknown, but very well ascertained, as I have been showing, and which, were they not under our own observation, or reported by recent and credible witnesses, would certainly be pronounced impossible? For as for those marvels which have no other testimony than the writers in whose books we read them, and who wrote without being divinely instructed, and are therefore liable to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, we cannot <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> blame any one who declines to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them.</p>

<p>For my own part, I do not wish all the marvels I have cited to be rashly accepted, for I do not myself <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them implicitly, save those which have either come under my own observation, or which any one can readily verify, such as the lime which is heated by water and cooled by oil; the magnet which by its <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> and insensible suction attracts the iron, but has no affect on a straw; the peacock's flesh which triumphs over the corruption from which not the flesh of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> is exempt; the chaff so chilling that it prevents snow from melting, so heating that it forces apples to ripen; the glowing fire, which, in accordance with its glowing appearance, whitens the stones it bakes, while, contrary to its glowing appearance, it begrimes most things it burns (just as dirty stains are made by oil, however pure it be, and as the lines drawn by white silver are black); the charcoal, too, which by the action of fire is so completely changed from its original, that a finely marked piece of wood becomes hideous, the tough becomes brittle, the decaying incorruptible. Some of these things I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in common with many other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, some of them in common with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; and there are many others which I have not room to insert in this book. But of those which I have cited, though I have not myself seen, but only read about them, I have been unable to find trustworthy witnesses from whom I could ascertain whether they are facts, except in the case of that fountain in which burning torches are extinguished and extinguished torches lit, and of the apples of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, which are ripe to appearance, but are filled with dust. And indeed I have not met with any who said they had seen that fountain in Epirus, but with some who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> there was a similar fountain in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> not far from Grenoble. The fruit of the trees of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, however, is not only spoken of in books worthy of credit, but so many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> say that they have seen it that I cannot <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the fact. But the rest of the prodigies I receive without definitely affirming or denying them; and I have cited them because I read them in the authors of our adversaries, and that I might prove how many things many among themselves <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, because they are written in the works of their own literary men, though no rational explanation of them is given, and yet they scorn to  <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> us when we assert that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> will do what is beyond their experience and observation; and this they do even though we assign a reason for His work. For what better and stronger reason for such things can be given than to say that the Almighty is able to bring them to pass, and will bring them to pass, having predicted them in those books in which many other marvels which have already come to pass were predicted? Those things which are regarded as impossible will be accomplished according to the word, and by the power of that God who predicted and effected that the incredulous nations should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> incredible wonders.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; That It is Not Contrary to Nature That, in an Object Whose Nature is Known, There Should Be Discovered an Alteration of the Properties Which Have Been Known as Its Natural Properties.</h2>

<p>But if they reply that their reason for not believing us when we say that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies will always burn and yet never die, is that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be quite otherwise constituted; if they say that for this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> we cannot give the reason which was valid in the case of those natural <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, viz., that this is the natural property, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing&mdash;for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh&mdash;we find our answer in the sacred writings, that even this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh was constituted in one fashion before there was <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash;was constituted, in fact, so that it could not die&mdash;and in another fashion after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, being made such as we see it in this miserable state of mortality, unable to retain enduring life. And so in the resurrection of the dead shall it be constituted differently from its present well-known condition. But as they do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> these writings of ours, in which we read what nature man had in paradise, and how remote he was from the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of death&mdash;and indeed, if they did <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, we should of course have little trouble in debating with them the future punishment of the damned,&mdash; we must produce from the writings of their own most learned authorities some instances to show that it is possible for a thing to become different from what it was formerly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> characteristically to be.</p>

<p>From the book of Marcus Varro, entitled, <em>Of the Race of the Roman People</em>, I cite word for word the following instance: <q>There occurred a remarkable celestial portent; for Castor records that, in the brilliant star Venus, called Vesperugo by Plautus, and the lovely Hesperus by Homer, there occurred so strange a prodigy, that it changed its color, size, form, course, which never happened before nor since. Adrastus of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>, and Dion of Naples, famous mathematicians, said that this occurred in the reign of Ogyges.</q> So great an author as Varro would certainly not have called this a portent had it not seemed to be contrary to nature. For we say that all portents are contrary to nature; but they are not so. For how is that contrary to nature which happens by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of so mighty a Creator is certainly the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of each created thing? A portent, therefore, happens not contrary to nature, but contrary to what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> as nature. But who can number the multitude of portents recorded in profane histories? Let us then at present fix our attention on this one only which concerns the matter in hand. What is there so arranged by the Author of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of heaven and earth as the exactly ordered course of the stars? What is there established by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> so sure and inflexible? And yet, when it pleased Him who with sovereignty and supreme power regulates all He has created, a star conspicuous among the rest by its size and splendor changed its color, size, form, and, most wonderful of all, the order and law of its course! Certainly that phenomenon disturbed the canons of the astronomers, if there were any then, by which they tabulate, as by unerring computation, the past and future movements of the stars, so as to take upon them to affirm that this which happened to the morning star (Venus) never happened before nor since. But we read in the divine books that even the sun itself stood still when a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, Joshua the son of Nun, had begged this from God until victory should finish the battle he had begun; and that it even went back, that the promise of fifteen years added to the life of king Hezekiah might be sealed by this additional prodigy. But these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, which were vouchsafed to the merits of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, even when our adversaries <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, they attribute to magical arts; so Virgil, in the lines I quoted above, ascribes to magic the power to</p>

<blockquote><p>Turn rivers backward to their source,

<br>And make the stars forget their course.
</p></blockquote>

<p>For in our sacred books we read that this also happened, that a river <q>turned backward,</q> was stayed above while the lower part flowed on, when the people passed over under the above-mentioned leader, Joshua the son of Nun; and also when Elias the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> crossed; and afterwards, when his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> Elisha passed through it: and we have just  mentioned how, in the case of king Hezekiah the greatest of the <q>stars forgot its course.</q> But what happened to Venus, according to Varro, was not said by him to have happened in answer to any man's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>

<p>Let not the sceptics then benight themselves in this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things, as if divine power cannot bring to pass in an object anything else than what their own experience has shown them to be in its nature. Even the very things which are most commonly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as natural would not be less wonderful nor less effectual to excite surprise in all who beheld them, if men were not accustomed to admire nothing but what is rare. For who that thoughtfully observes the countless multitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and their similarity of nature, can fail to remark with surprise and admiration the individuality of each man's appearance, suggesting to us, as it does, that unless men were like one another, they would not be distinguished from the rest of the animals; while unless, on the other hand, they were unlike, they could not be distinguished from one another, so that those whom we declare to be like, we also find to be unlike? And the unlikeness is the more wonderful consideration of the two; for a common nature seems rather to require similarity. And yet, because the very rarity of things is that which makes them wonderful, we are filled with much greater wonder when we are introduced to two men so like, that we either always or frequently mistake in endeavoring to distinguish between them.</p>

<p>But possibly, though Varro is a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> historian, and a very learned one, they may disbelieve that what I have cited from him <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> occurred; or they may say the example is invalid, because the star did not for any length of time continue to follow its new course, but returned to its ordinary orbit. There is, then, another phenomenon at present open to their observation, and which, in my opinion, ought to be sufficient to convince them that, though they have observed and ascertained some natural law, they ought not on that account to prescribe to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as if He could not change and turn it into something very different from what they have observed. The land of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> was not always as it now is; but once it had the appearance of other lands, and enjoyed equal if not richer fertility; for, in the divine narrative, it was compared to the paradise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But after it was touched [by fire] from heaven, as even pagan history testifies, and as is now witnessed by those who visit the spot, it became unnaturally and horribly sooty in appearance; and its apples, under a deceitful appearance of ripeness, contain ashes within. Here is a thing which was of one kind, and is of another. You see how its nature was converted by the wonderful transmutation wrought by the Creator of all natures into so very disgusting a diversity&mdash;an alteration which after so long a time took place, and after so long a time still continues. As therefore it was not impossible to God to create such natures as He pleased, so it is not impossible to Him to change these natures of His own creation into whatever He pleases, and thus spread abroad a multitude of those marvels which are called monsters, portents, prodigies, phenomena,  and which if I were minded to cite and record, what end would there be to this work? They say that they are called <q>monsters,</q> because they demonstrate or signify something; <q>portents,</q> because they portend something; and so forth.  But let their <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a> see how they are either deceived, or even when they do predict <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> things, it is because they are inspired by spirits, who are intent upon entangling the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> (worthy, indeed, of such a <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>) in the meshes of a hurtful curiosity, or how they light now and then upon some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because they make so many predictions. Yet, for our part, these things which happen contrary to nature, and are said to be contrary to nature (as the apostle, speaking after the manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, says, that to graft the wild olive into the good olive, and to partake of its fatness, is contrary to nature), and are called monsters, phenomena, portents, prodigies, ought to demonstrate, portend, predict that God will bring to pass what He has foretold regarding the bodies of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, no difficulty preventing Him, no law of nature prescribing to Him His limit. How He has foretold what He is to do, I think I have sufficiently shown in the preceding book, culling from the sacred Scriptures, both of the New and Old Testaments, not, indeed, all the passages that relate to this, but as many as I judged to suffice for this work.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; Of Hell, and the Nature of Eternal Punishments.</h2>

<p>So then what God by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has said of the everlasting punishment of the damned shall come to pass&mdash; shall without fail come to pass&mdash;<q>their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121505"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse24">Isaiah&nbsp;66:24</a></span> In order to impress this upon us most forcibly, the Lord Jesus Himself, when ordering us to cut off  our members, meaning thereby those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom a man loves as the most useful members of his body, says, <q>It is better for you to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, into the fire that never shall be quenched; where their worm dies not, and their fire is not quenched.</q> Similarly of the foot: <q>It is better for you to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, into the fire that never shall be quenched; where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.</q> So, too, of the eye: <q>It is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> fire: where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121506"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse43">Mark&nbsp;9:43-48</a></span> He did not shrink from using the same words three times over in one passage. And who is not terrified by this repetition, and by the threat of that punishment uttered so vehemently by the lips of the Lord Himself?</p>

<p>Now they who would refer both the fire and the worm to the spirit, and not to the body, affirm that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, who are separated from the kindgdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall be burned, as it were, by the anguish of a spirit repenting too late and fruitlessly; and they contend that fire is therefore not inappropriately used to express this burning torment, as when the apostle exclaims <q>Who is offended, and I burn not?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121507"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse29">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:29</a></span> The worm, too, they think, is to be similarly understood. For it is written they say, <q>As the moth consumes the garment, and the worm the wood, so does grief consume the heart of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121508"><a href="../bible/isa051.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;51:8</a></span> But they who make no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that in that future punishment both body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall suffer, affirm that the body shall be burned with fire, while the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be, as it were, gnawed by a worm of anguish. Though this view is more reasonable&mdash;for it is absurd to suppose that either body or <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will escape pain in the future punishment&mdash;yet, for my own part, I find it easier to understand both as referring to the body than to suppose that neither does; and I think that Scripture is silent regarding the spiritual pain of the damned, because, though not expressed, it is necessarily understood that in a body thus tormented the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also is tortured with a fruitless repentance. For we read in the ancient Scriptures, <q>The vengeance of the flesh of the ungodly is fire and worms.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121509"><a href="../bible/sir007.htm#verse17">Sirach&nbsp;7:17</a></span> It might have been more briefly said, <q>The vengeance of the ungodly.</q> Why, then, was it said, <q>The flesh of the ungodly,</q> unless because both the fire and the worm are to be the punishment of the flesh? Or if the object of the writer in saying, <q>The vengeance of the flesh,</q> was to indicate that this shall be the punishment of those who live after the flesh (for this leads to the second death, as the apostle intimated when he said, <q>For if you live after the flesh, you shall die</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121510"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;8:13</a></span>, let each one make his own choice, either assigning the fire to the body and the worm to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash;the one figuratively, the other really&mdash;or assigning both really to the body. For I have already sufficiently made out that animals can live in the fire, in burning without being consumed, in pain without dying, by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the most <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> Creator, to whom no one can deny that this is possible, if he be not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> by whom has been made all that is wonderful in all nature. For it is God Himself who has wrought all these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, great and small, in this world which I have mentioned, and incomparably more which I have omitted, and who has enclosed these marvels in this world, itself the greatest <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of all. Let each man, then, choose which he will, whether he thinks that the worm is real and pertains to the body, or that spiritual things are meant by bodily representations, and that it belongs to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But which of these is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> will be more readily discovered by the facts themselves, when there shall be in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as shall not require that their own experience teach them the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of these punishments, but as shall, by its own fullness and perfection, suffice to instruct them in this matter. For <q>now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part, until that which is perfect has come;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121511"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:9-10</a></span> only, this we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> about those future bodies, that they shall be such as shall certainly be pained by the fire.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; Whether the Fire of Hell, If It Be Material Fire, Can Burn the Wicked Spirits, that is to Say, Devils, Who are Immaterial.</h2>

<p>Here arises the question: If the fire is not to be immaterial, analogous to the pain of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but material, burning by contact, so that bodies may be tormented in it, how can <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> be punished in it? For it is undoubtedly the same fire which is to serve for the punishment of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and of devils, according to the words of Christ: <q>Depart from me, you cursed, into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121512"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> unless, perhaps, as learned men have thought, the devils have a kind of body made of that dense and humid air which we feel strikes us when the  wind is blowing. And if this kind of substance could not be affected by fire, it could not burn when heated in the baths. For in order to burn, it is first burned, and affects other things as itself is affected. But if any one maintains that the devils have no bodies, this is not a matter either to be laboriously investigated, or to be debated with keenness. For why may we not assert that even immaterial spirits may, in some extraordinary way, yet really be pained by the punishment of material fire, if the spirits of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which also are certainly immaterial, are both now contained in material members of the body, and in the world to come shall be indissolubly united to their own bodies? Therefore, though the devils have no bodies, yet their spirits, that is, the devils themselves, shall be brought into thorough contact with the material fires, to be tormented by them; not that the fires themselves with which they are brought into contact shall be animated by their connection with these spirits, and become animals composed of body and spirit, but, as I said, this junction will be effected in a wonderful and ineffable way, so that they shall receive pain from the fires, but give no life to them. And, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, this other mode of union, by which bodies and spirits are bound together and become animals, is thoroughly marvellous, and beyond the comprehension of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, though this it is which is man.</p>

<p>I would indeed say that these spirits will burn without any body of their own, as that rich man was burning in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> when he exclaimed, <q>I am tormented in this flame,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121513"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse24">Luke&nbsp;16:24</a></span> were I not aware that it is aptly said in reply, that that flame was of the same nature as the eyes he raised and fixed on Lazarus, as the tongue on which he entreated that a little cooling water might be dropped, or as the finger of Lazarus, with which he asked that this might be done&mdash;all of which took place where <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> exist without bodies. Thus, therefore, both that flame in which he burned and that drop he begged were immaterial, and resembled the visions of sleepers or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, to whom immaterial objects appear in a bodily form. For the man himself who is in such a state, though it be in spirit only, not in body, yet sees himself so like to his own body that he cannot discern any difference whatever. But that <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, which also is called a lake of fire and brimstone, <span class="stiki" id="note121514"><a href="../bible/rev020.htm#verse10">Revelation&nbsp;20:10</a></span> will be material fire, and will torment the bodies of the damned, whether men or devils,&mdash; the solid bodies of the one, aerial bodies of the others; or if only men have bodies as well as <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, yet the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, though without bodies, shall be so connected with the bodily fires as to receive pain without imparting life. One fire certainly shall be the lot of both, for thus the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has declared.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; Whether It is Just that the Punishments of Sins Last Longer Than the Sins Themselves Lasted.</h2>

<p>Some, however, of those against whom we are defending the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, think it <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> that any man be doomed to an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which, no matter how great they were, were perpetrated in a brief space of time; as if any law ever regulated the duration of the punishment by the duration of the offense punished! Cicero tells us that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> recognize eight kinds of penalty,&mdash; damages, imprisonment, scourging, reparation,  disgrace, exile, death, slavery. Is there any one of these which may be compressed into a brevity proportioned to the rapid commission of the offense, so that no longer time may be spent in its punishment than in its perpetration, unless, perhaps, reparation? For this requires that the offender suffer what he did, as that clause of the law says, <q>Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121516"><a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse24">Exodus&nbsp;21:24</a></span> For certainly it is possible for an offender to lose his eye by the severity of legal retaliation in as brief a time as he deprived another of his eye by the cruelty of his own lawlessness. But if scourging be a reasonable penalty for kissing another man's wife, is not the fault of an instant visited with long hours of atonement, and the momentary delight punished with lasting pain? What shall we say of imprisonment? Must the criminal be confined only for so long a time as he spent on the offense for which he is committed? Or is not a penalty of many years' confinement imposed on the slave who has provoked his master with a word, or has struck him a blow that is quickly over? And as to damages, disgrace, exile, slavery, which are commonly inflicted so as to admit of no relaxation or pardon, do not these resemble <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishments in so far as this short life allows a resemblance? For they are not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> only because the life in which they are endured is not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; and yet the crimes which are punished with these most protracted sufferings are perpetrated in a very brief space of time. Nor is there any one who would suppose that the pains of punishment should occupy as short a time as the offense; or that <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, sacrilege, or any other crime, should be measured, not by the enormity  of the injury or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but by the length of time spent in its perpetration. Then as to the award of death for any great crime, do the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> reckon the punishment to consist in the brief moment in which death is inflicted, or in this, that the offender is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> banished from the society of the living? And just as the punishment of the first death cuts men off from this present mortal city, so does the punishment of the second death cut men off from that future <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> city. For as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of this present city do not provide for the executed criminal's return to it, so neither is he who is condemned to the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">second death</a> recalled again to life everlasting. But if temporal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is visited with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, how then, they say, is that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which your Christ says, <q>With the same measure that you mete withal it shall be measured to you again?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121517"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;6:38</a></span> and they do not observe that <q>the same measure</q> refers, not to an equal space of time, but to the retribution of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or, in other words, to the law by which he who has done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> suffers <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Besides, these words could be appropriately understood as referring to the matter of which our Lord was speaking when He used them, viz., judgments and condemnation. Thus, if he who <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> judges and condemns is himself <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> judged and condemned, he receives <q>with the same measure</q> though not the same thing as he gave. For judgment he gave, and judgment he receives, though the judgment he gave was <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, the judgment he receives just.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; Of the Greatness of the First Transgression, on Account of Which Eternal Punishment is Due to All Who are Not Within the Pale of the Saviour's Grace.</h2>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment seems hard and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> perceptions, because in the weakness of our mortal condition there is wanting that highest and purest wisdom by which it can be perceived how great a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> was committed in that first transgression. The more enjoyment man found in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the greater was his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in abandoning Him; and he who destroyed in himself a good which might have been <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, became worthy of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Hence the whole mass of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is condemned; for he who at first gave entrance to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has been punished with all his posterity who were in him as in a root, so that no one is exempt from this just and due punishment, unless delivered by mercy and undeserved <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is so apportioned that in some is displayed the efficacy of merciful <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in the rest the efficacy of just retribution. For both could not be displayed in all; for if all had remained  under the punishment of just condemnation, there would have been seen in no one the mercy of redeeming <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And, on the other hand, if all had been transferred from darkness to light, the severity of retribution would have been manifested in none. But many more are left under punishment than are delivered from it, in order that it may thus be shown what was due to all. And had it been inflicted on all, no one could <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> have found fault with the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of Him who takes vengeance; whereas, in the deliverance of so many from that just award, there is <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to render the most cordial thanks to the gratuitous bounty of Him who delivers.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; Against the Opinion of Those Who Think that the Punishments of the Wicked After Death are Purgatorial.</h2>

<p>The Platonists, indeed, while they maintain that no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are unpunished, suppose that all punishment is administered for remedial purposes,  be it inflicted by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> or divine law, in this life or after death; for a man may be scathless here, or, though punished, may yet not amend. Hence that passage of Virgil, where, when he had said of our earthly bodies and mortal members, that our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> derive&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p>Hence wild desires and grovelling fears,

<br>And <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> laughter, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> tears;

<br>Immured in dungeon-seeming night,

<br>They look abroad, yet see no light,

<br>goes on to say:

<p>Nay, when at last the life has fled,

<br>And left the body cold and dead,

<br>Ee'n then there passes not away

<br>The painful heritage of clay;

<br>Full many a long-contracted stain

<br>Perforce must linger deep in grain.

<br>So penal sufferings they endure

<br>For ancient crime, to make them pure;

<br>Some hang aloft in open view,

<br>For winds to pierce them through and through,

<br>While others purge their guilt deep-dyed

<br>In burning fire or whelming tide. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>They who are of this opinion would have all punishments after death to be purgatorial; and as the elements of air, fire, and water are superior to earth, one or other of these may  be the instrument of expiating and purging away the stain contracted by the contagion of earth. So Virgil hints at the air in the words, <q>Some hang aloft for winds to pierce;</q> at the water in <q>whelming tide;</q> and at fire in the expression <q>in burning fire.</q> For our part, we recognize that even in this life some punishments are purgatorial,&mdash; not, indeed, to those whose life is none the better, but rather the worse for them, but to those who are constrained by them to amend their life. All other punishments, whether temporal or <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, inflicted as they are on every one by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine providence</a>, are sent either on account of past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> presently allowed in the life, or to exercise and reveal a man's graces. They may be inflicted by the instrumentality of bad men and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as well as of the good. For even if any one suffers some hurt through another's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> or mistake, the man indeed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> whose <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> does the harm; but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who by His just though hidden judgment permits it to be done, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not. But temporary punishments are suffered by some in this life only, by others after death, by others both now and then; but all of them before that last and strictest judgment. But of those who suffer temporary punishments after death, all are not doomed to those everlasting pains which are to follow that judgment; for to some, as we have already said, what is not remitted in this world is remitted in the next, that is, they are not punished with the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment of the world to come.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; Of the Temporary Punishments of This Life to Which the Human Condition is Subject.</h2>

<p>Quite exceptional are those who are not punished in this life, but only afterwards. Yet that there have been some who have reached the decrepitude of age without experiencing even the slightest sickness, and who have had uninterrupted enjoyment of life, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both from report and from my own observation. However, the very life we mortals lead is itself all punishment, for it is all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> declare, where it is written, <q>Is not the life of man upon earth a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121521"><a href="../bible/job007.htm#verse1">Job&nbsp;7:1</a></span> For <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is itself no slight punishment, or want of culture, which it is with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> thought so necessary to escape, that boys are compelled, under pain of severe punishment, to learn trades or letters; and the learning to which they are driven by punishment is itself so much of a punishment to them, that they sometimes prefer the pain that drives them to the pain to which they are driven by it. And who would not shrink from the alternative, and elect to die, if it were proposed to him either to suffer death or to be again an infant? Our infancy, indeed, introducing us to this life not with laughter but with tears, seems unconsciously to predict the ills we are to encounter.  Zoroaster alone is said to have laughed when he was born, and that unnatural omen portended no good to him. For he is said to have been the inventor of magical arts, though indeed they were unable to secure to him even the poor felicity of this present life against the assaults of his enemies. For, himself king of the Bactrians, he was conquered by Ninus king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>. In short, the words of Scripture, <q>An heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of their mother's womb till the day that they return to the mother of all things,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121523"><a href="../bible/sir040.htm#verse1">Sirach&nbsp;40:1</a></span> &mdash; these words so infallibly find fulfillment, that even the little ones, who by the layer of regeneration have been freed from the bond of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in which alone they were held, yet suffer many ills, and in some instances are even exposed to the assaults of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>. But let us not for a moment suppose that this suffering is prejudicial to their future <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, even though it has so increased as to sever <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from body, and to terminate their life in that early age.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; That Everything Which the Grace of God Does in the Way of Rescuing Us from the Inveterate Evils in Which We are Sunk, Pertains to the Future World, in Which All Things are Made New.</h2>

<p>Nevertheless, in the <q>heavy yoke that is laid upon the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of their mother's womb to the day that they return to the mother of all things,</q> there is found an admirable though painful monitor teaching us to be sober-minded, and convincing us that this life has become penal in consequence of that outrageous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> which was perpetrated in Paradise, and that all to which the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> invites belongs to that future inheritance which awaits us in the world to come, and is offered for our acceptance, as the earnest that we may, in its own due time, obtain that of which it is the pledge. Now, therefore, let us walk in hope, and let us by the spirit mortify the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the flesh, and so make progress from day to day. For <q>the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>  them that are His;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121524"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:19</a></span> and <q>as many as are led by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, they are sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121525"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;8:14</a></span> but by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not by nature. For there is but one <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> by nature, who in His compassion became <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> for our sakes, that we, by nature sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, might by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> become through Him sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For He, abiding unchangeable, took upon Him our nature, that thereby He might take us to Himself; and, holding fast His own divinity, He became partaker of our infirmity, that we, being changed into some better thing, might, by participating in His righteousness and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, lose our own properties of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and mortality, and preserve whatever good quality He had implanted in our nature perfected now by sharing in the goodness of His nature. For as by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one man we have fallen into a misery so deplorable, so by the righteousness of one Man, who also is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall we come to a blessedness inconceivably exalted. Nor ought any one to trust that he has passed from the one man to the other until he shall have reached that place where there is no <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, and have entered into the peace which he seeks in the many and various conflicts of this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, in which <q>the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121526"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> Now, such a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> as this would have had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> if <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> had, in the exercise of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, continued steadfast in the uprightness in which it was created. But now in its misery it makes <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon itself, because in its blessedness it would not continue at peace with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this, though it be a miserable calamity, is better than the earlier stages of this life, which do not recognize that a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is to be maintained. For better is it to contend with <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> than without conflict to be subdued by them. Better, I say, is <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the hope of peace everlasting than captivity without any thought of deliverance. We long, indeed, for the cessation of this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and, kindled by the flame of divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, we burn for entrance on that well-ordered peace in which whatever is inferior is for ever subordinated to what is above it. But if (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) there had been no hope of so blessed a consummation, we should still have preferred to endure the hardness of this conflict, rather than, by our non-resistance, to yield ourselves to the dominion of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; The Laws of Grace, Which Extend to All the Epochs of the Life of the Regenerate.</h2>

<p>But such is God's mercy towards the vessels of mercy which He has prepared for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that even the first age of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that is, infancy, which submits without any resistance to the flesh, and the second age, which is called boyhood, and which has not yet understanding enough to undertake this warfare, and therefore yields to almost every vicious pleasure (because though this age has the power of speech,  and may therefore seem to have passed infancy, the mind is still too weak to comprehend the commandment), yet if either of these ages has received the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the Mediator, then, although the present life be immediately brought to an end, the child, having been translated from the power of darkness to the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, shall not only be saved from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishments, but shall not even suffer purgatorial torments after death. For spiritual regeneration of itself suffices to prevent any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> consequences resulting after death from the connection with death which carnal generation forms.  But when we reach that age which can now comprehend the commandment, and submit to the dominion of law, we must declare <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and wage this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> keenly, lest we be landed in damnable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And if <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> have not gathered strength, by habitual victory they are more easily overcome and subdued; but if they have been used to conquer and rule, it is only with difficulty and labor they are mastered. And indeed this victory cannot be sincerely and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> gained but by delighting in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> righteousness, and it is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Christ that gives this. For if the law be present with its command, and the Spirit be absent with His help, the presence of the prohibition serves only to increase the desire to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and adds the guilt of transgression. Sometimes, indeed, patent <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are overcome by other and hidden <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, which are reckoned <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, though <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and a kind of ruinous self-sufficiency are their informing principles. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are then only to be considered overcome when they are conquered by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself alone gives, and which He gives only through the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who became a partaker of our mortality that He might make us partakers of His divinity. But few indeed are they who are so <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> as to have passed their youth without committing any damnable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, either by dissolute or violent conduct, or by following some godless and unlawful opinions, but have subdued by their greatness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> everything in them which could make them the slaves of carnal pleasures. The greater  number having first become transgressors of the law that they have received, and having allowed <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> to have the ascendency in them, then flee to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for help, and so, by a penitence more bitter, and a struggle more violent than it would otherwise have been, they subdue the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thus give it its lawful authority over the flesh, and become victors. Whoever, therefore, desires to escape <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, let him not only be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but also justified in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and so let him in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> pass from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And let him not fancy that there are any purgatorial pains except before that final and dreadful judgment. We must not, however deny that even the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> will be proportioned to the deserts of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, so that to some it will be more, and to others less painful, whether this result be accomplished by a variation in the temperature of the fire itself, graduated according to every one's merit, or whether it be that the heat remains the same, but that all do not feel it with equal intensity of torment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.&mdash; Of Those Who Fancy that No Men Shall Be Punished Eternally.</h2>

<p>I must now, I see, enter the lists of amicable controversy with those tender-hearted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who decline to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that any, or that all of those whom the infallibly just Judge may pronounce worthy of the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, shall suffer <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, and who suppose that they shall be delivered after a fixed term of punishment, longer or shorter according to the amount of each man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. In respect of this matter, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> was even more indulgent; for he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that even the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, after suffering those more severe and prolonged pains which their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> deserved, should be delivered from their torments, and associated with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not without reason, condemned him for this and other <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, especially for his theory of the ceaseless alternation of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and misery, and the interminable transitions from the one state to the other at fixed periods of ages; for in this theory he lost even the credit of being merciful, by allotting to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> real miseries for the expiation of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and false <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, which brought them no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and secure <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that is, no fearless assurance of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessedness. Very different, however, is the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> we speak of, which is dictated by the tenderness of these <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who suppose that the sufferings of those who are condemned in the judgment will be temporary, while the blessedness of all who are sooner or later set <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Which opinion, if it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> because it is merciful, will be so much the better and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> in proportion as it becomes more merciful. Let, then, this fountain of mercy be extended, and flow forth even to the lost <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and let them also be set free, at least after as many and long ages as seem fit! Why does this stream of mercy flow to all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and dry up as soon as it reaches the angelic? And yet they dare not extend their pity further, and propose the deliverance of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself. Or if any one is bold enough to do so, he does indeed put to shame their charity, but is himself convicted of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that is more unsightly, and a wresting of God's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that is more perverse, in proportion as his clemency of sentiment seems to be greater. </p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; Of Those Who Fancy That, on Account of the Saints' Intercession, Man Shall Be Damned in the Last Judgment.</h2>

<p>There are others, again, with whose opinions I have become acquainted in conversation, who, though they seem to reverence the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, are yet of reprehensible life, and who accordingly, in their own interest, attribute to God a still greater compassion towards men. For they acknowledge that it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> predicted in the divine word that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and unbelieving are worthy of punishment, but they assert that, when the judgment comes, mercy will prevail. For, say they, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having compassion on them, will give them up to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and intercessions of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. For if the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> used to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them when they suffered from their cruel <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, how much more will they do so when they see them prostrate and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> suppliants? For we cannot, they say, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall lose their bowels of compassion when they have attained the most perfect and complete <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; so that they who, when still sinners, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for their enemies, should now, when they are freed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, withhold from interceding for their suppliants. Or shall God refuse to listen to so many of His beloved children, when their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has purged their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of all hindrance to His answering them? And the passage of the psalm which is cited by those who admit that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men and infidels shall be punished for a long time, though in the end  delivered from all sufferings, is claimed also by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> we are now speaking of as making much more for them. The verse runs: <q>Shall God forget to be gracious? Shall He in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> shut up His tender mercies?</q>  His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, they say, would condemn all that are unworthy of everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to endless punishment. But if He suffer them to be punished for a long time, or even at all, must He not shut up His tender mercies, which the Psalmist implies He will not do? For he does not say, Shall He in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> shut up His tender mercies for a long period? But he implies that He will not shut them up at all.</p>

<p>And they deny that thus God's threat of judgment is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be false even though He condemn no man, any more than we can say that His threat to overthrow Nineveh was false, though the destruction which was absolutely predicted was not accomplished. For He did not say, <q>Nineveh shall be overthrown if they do not repent and amend their ways,</q> but without any such condition He foretold that the city should be overthrown. And this prediction, they maintain, was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> because God predicted the punishment which they deserved, although He was not to inflict it. For though He spared them on their repentance yet He was certainly aware that they would repent, and, notwithstanding, absolutely and definitely predicted that the city should be overthrown. This was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, they say, in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of severity, because they were worthy of it; but in respect of the compassion which checked His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, so that He spared the suppliants from the punishment with which He had threatened the rebellious, it was not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. If, then, He spared those whom His own <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> was provoked at His sparing, how much more shall He spare those more wretched suppliants for whom all His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall intercede? And they suppose that this conjecture of theirs is not hinted at in Scripture, for the sake of stimulating many to reformation of life through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of very protracted or <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> sufferings, and of stimulating others to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for those who have not reformed. However, they think that the divine oracles are not altogether silent on this point; for they ask to what purpose is it said, <q>How great is Your goodness which You have hidden for them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> You,</q>  if it be not to teach us that the great and hidden sweetness of God's mercy is concealed in order that men may <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? To the same purpose they think the apostle said, <q>For God has concluded all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in unbelief, that He may have mercy upon all,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121532"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;11:32</a></span> signifying that no one should be condemned by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And yet they who hold this opinion do not extend it to the acquittal or liberation of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> tenderness is moved only towards men, and they plead chiefly their own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, holding out false hopes of impunity to their own depraved lives by means of this quasi compassion of God to the whole race. Consequently they who promise this impunity even to the prince of the devils and his satellites make a still fuller exhibition of the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; Of Those Who Promise Impunity from All Sins Even to Heretics, Through Virtue of Their Participation of the Body of Christ.</h2>

<p>So, too, there are others who promise this deliverance from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, not, indeed, to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but only to those who have been washed in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and who become partakers of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, no matter how they have lived, or what <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or impiety they have fallen into. They ground this opinion on the saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <q>This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that if any man eat thereof, he shall not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If a man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121533"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse50">John&nbsp;6:50-51</a></span> Therefore, say they, it follows that these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> must be delivered from death <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and at one time or other be introduced to everlasting life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; Of Those Who Promise This Indulgence Not to All, But Only to Those Who Have Been Baptized as Catholics, Though Afterwards They Have Broken Out into Many Crimes and Heresies.</h2>

<p>There are others still who make this promise not even to all who have received the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ and of His body, but only to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, however badly they have lived. For these have eaten the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not only sacramentally but really, being incorporated in His body, as the apostle says, <q>We, being many, are one bread, one body;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121534"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:17</a></span> so that, though they have afterwards lapsed into some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, or even into <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, yet by virtue of this one thing, that they have received the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and eaten the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is to say, in the Catholic Church, they shall not die <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, but at one time or other obtain <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; and all that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of theirs shall not avail to make their punishment  <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, but only proportionately long and severe.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.&mdash; Of Those Who Assert that All Catholics Who Continue in the Faith Even Though by the Depravity of Their Lives They Have Merited Hell Fire, Shall Be Saved on Account of the <q>Foundation</q> Of Their Faith.</h2>

<p>There are some, too, who found upon the expression of Scripture, <q>He that endures to the end shall be saved,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121535"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;24:13</a></span> and who promise <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> only to those who continue in the Catholic Church; and though such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have lived badly, yet, say they, they shall be saved as by fire through <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the foundation of which the apostle says, <q>For other foundation has no man laid than that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus. Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day of the Lord shall declare it, for it shall be revealed by fire; and each man's work shall be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> of what sort it is. If any man's work shall endure which he has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. But if any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121536"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:11-15</a></span> They say, accordingly, that the Catholic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, no matter what his life be, has Christ as his foundation, while this foundation is not possessed by any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which is separated from the unity of His body. &nbsp;And therefore, through <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of this foundation, even though the Catholic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> by the inconsistency of his life has been as one building up wood, hay, stubble, upon it, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he shall be saved by fire, in other words, that he shall be delivered after tasting the pain of that fire to which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall be condemned at the last judgment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; Of Those Who Fancy that the Sins Which are Intermingled with Alms-Deeds Shall Not Be Charged at the Day of Judgment.</h2>

<p>I have also met with some who are of opinion that such only as neglect to cover their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a> shall be punished in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>; and they cite the words of the Apostle James, <q>He shall have judgment without mercy who has shown no mercy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121537"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse13">James&nbsp;2:13</a></span> Therefore, say they, he who has not amended his ways, but yet has intermingled his profligate and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> actions with works of mercy, shall receive mercy in the judgment, so that he shall either quite escape condemnation, or shall be liberated from his doom after some time shorter or longer. They suppose that this was the reason why the Judge Himself of quick and dead declined to mention anything else than works of mercy done or omitted, when awarding to those on His right hand life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and to those on His left everlasting punishment. <span class="stiki" id="note121538"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;25:33</a></span> To the same purpose, they say, is the daily petition we make in the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a>, <q>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121539"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> For, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, whoever pardons the person who has wronged him does a charitable action. And this has been so highly commended by the Lord Himself, that He says, <q>For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121540"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;6:14-15</a></span> And so it is to this kind of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a> that the saying of the Apostle James refers, <q>He shall have judgment without mercy that has shown no mercy.</q> And our Lord, they say, made no distinction of great and small <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but <q>Your Father will forgive your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, if you forgive men theirs.</q> Consequently they conclude that, though a man has led an abandoned life up to the last day of it, yet whatsoever his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have been, they are all remitted by virtue of this daily <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, if only he has been mindful to attend to this one thing, that when they who have done him any injury ask his pardon, he forgive them from his heart.</p>

<p>When, by God's help, I have replied to all these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, I shall conclude this (twenty-first) book.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.&mdash; Against Those Who are of Opinion that the Punishment Neither of the Devil Nor of Wicked Men Shall Be Eternal.</h2>

<p>First of all, it behooves us to inquire and to recognize why the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has not been able to tolerate the idea that promises cleansing or indulgence to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> even after the most severe and protracted punishment. For so many <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, imbued with the spirit of the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, did not grudge to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of any rank or character that they should enjoy the blessedness of the heavenly kingdom after being cleansed by suffering, but rather they perceived that they could not invalidate nor evacuate the divine sentence which the Lord predicted that He would pronounce in the judgment, saying, <q>Depart from me, you cursed, into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121541"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> For  here it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> shall burn in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>. And there is also that declaration in the Apocalypse, <q>The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> their deceiver was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where also are the beast and the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a>. And they shall be tormented day and night for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121542"><a href="../bible/rev020.htm#verse10">Revelation&nbsp;20:10</a></span> In the former passage <q>everlasting</q> is used, in the latter <q>for ever;</q> and by these words Scripture is wont to mean nothing else than endless duration. And therefore no other reason, no reason more obvious and just, can be found for holding it as the fixed and immovable belief of the truest <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> shall never return to the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, than that Scripture, which deceives no man, says that God spared them not, and that they were condemned beforehand by Him, and cast into prisons of darkness in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note121543"><a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:4</a></span> being reserved to the judgment of the last day, when <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> shall receive them, in which they shall be tormented world without end. And if this be so, how can it be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or even some, shall be withdrawn from the endurance of punishment after some time has been spent in it? How can this be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> without enervating our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment of the devils? For if all or some of those to whom it shall be said, <q>Depart from me, you cursed, into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121544"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> are not to be always in that fire, then what reason is there for believing that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> shall always be there? Or is perhaps the sentence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is to be pronounced on <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> alike, to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the case of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, false in that of men? Plainly it will be so if the conjectures of men are to weigh more than the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But because this is absurd, they who desire to be rid of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment ought to abstain from arguing against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and rather, while yet there is opportunity, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the divine commands. Then what a fond fancy is it to suppose that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment means long continued punishment, while <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life means life without end, since Christ in the very same passage spoke of both in similar terms in one and the same sentence, <q>These shall go away into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, but the righteous into life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121545"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;25:46</a></span> If both destinies are <q><a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>,</q> then we must either understand both as long-continued but at last terminating, or both as endless. For they are correlative&mdash;on the one hand, punishment <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, on the other hand, life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. And to say in one and the same sense, life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> shall be endless, punishment <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> shall come to an end, is the height of absurdity. Wherefore, as the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall be endless, so too the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment of those who are doomed to it shall have no end.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.&mdash; Against Those Who Fancy that in the Judgment of God All the Accused Will Be Spared in Virtue of the Prayers of the Saints.</h2>

<p>And this reasoning is equally conclusive against those who, in their own interest, but under the guise of a greater tenderness of spirit, attempt to invalidate the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who assert that these words are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, not because men shall suffer those things which are threatened by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but because they deserve to suffer them. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they say, will yield them to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, who will then the more earnestly <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for their enemies, as they shall be more perfect in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and whose <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> will be the more efficacious and the more worthy of God's ear, because now purged from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatsoever. Why, then, if in that perfected <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> be so pure and all-availing, will they not use them in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> for whom <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> is prepared, that God may mitigate His sentence and alter it, and extricate them from that fire? Or will there, perhaps, be some one hardy enough to affirm that even the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will make common <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men (then become the equals of God's <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>), and will intercede for the guilty, both men and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, that mercy may spare them the punishment which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has pronounced them to deserve? But this has been asserted by no one sound in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; nor will be. Otherwise there is no reason why the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should not even now <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, since God her Master has ordered her to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for her enemies. The reason, then, which prevents the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from now <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, whom she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to be her enemies, is the identical reason which shall prevent her, however perfected in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> at the last judgment for those men who are to be punished in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>. At present she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for her enemies among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, because they have yet opportunity for fruitful repentance. For what does she especially beg for them but that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would grant them repentance,</q> as the apostle says, <q>that they may return to soberness out of the snare of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, by whom they are held captive according to his will?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121546"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse25">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:25-26</a></span> But if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>  were certified who those are, who, though they are still abiding in this life, are yet <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to go with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, then for them she could no more <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> than for him. But since she has this certainty regarding no man, she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for all her enemies who yet live in this world; and yet she is not heard in behalf of all. But she is heard in the case of those only who, though they oppose the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are yet <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to become her sons through her intercession. But if any retain an impenitent heart until death, and are not converted from enemies into sons, does the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> continue to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them, for the spirits, <em>i.e</em>., of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> deceased? And why does she cease to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them, unless because the man who was not translated into Christ's kingdom while he was in the body, is now judged to be of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan's</a> following?</p>

<p>It is then, I say, the same reason which prevents the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at any time from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, which prevents her from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> hereafter for those men who are to be punished in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>; and this also is the reason why, though she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> even for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> so long as they live, she yet does not even in this world <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the unbelieving and godless who are dead. For some of the dead, indeed, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> individuals is heard; but it is for those who, having been regenerated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, did not spend their life so wickedly that they can be judged unworthy of such compassion, nor so well that they can be considered to have no need of it.  As also, after the resurrection, there will be some of the dead to whom, after they have endured the pains proper to the spirits of the dead, mercy shall be accorded, and acquittal from the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>. For were there not some whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, though not remitted in this life, shall be remitted in that which is to come, it could not be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said, <q>They shall not be forgiven, neither in this world, neither in that which is to come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121548"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;12:32</a></span> But when the Judge of quick and dead has said, <q>Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world,</q> and to those on the other side, <q>Depart from me, you cursed, into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, which is prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q> and <q>These shall go away into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, but the righteous into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life,</q>  it were excessively presumptuous to say that the punishment of any of those whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has said shall go away into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment shall not be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and so bring either despair or <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> upon the corresponding promise of life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>

<p>Let no man then so understand the words of the Psalmist, <q>Shall God forget to be gracious? Shall He shut up in His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> His tender mercies</q>  as if the sentence of God were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of good men, false of bad men, or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of good men and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but false of bad men. For the Psalmist's words refer to the vessels of mercy and the children of the promise, of whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> himself was one; for when he had said, <q>Shall God forget to be gracious? Shall He shut up in His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> His tender mercies?</q> and then immediately subjoins, <q>And I said, Now I begin: this is the change wrought by the right hand of the Most High,</q>  he manifestly explained what he meant by the words, <q>Shall he shut up in His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> His tender mercies?</q> For God's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is this mortal life, in which man is made like to vanity, and his days pass as a shadow.  Yet in this <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> God does not forget to be gracious, causing His sun to shine and His rain to descend on the just and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note121553"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> and thus He does not in His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> cut short His tender mercies, and especially in what the Psalmist speaks of in the words, <q>Now I begin: this change is from the right hand of the Most High;</q> for He changes for the better the vessels of mercy, even while they are still in this most wretched life, which is God's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and even while His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is manifesting itself in this miserable corruption; for <q>in His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> He does not shut up His tender mercies.</q> And since the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this divine canticle is quite satisfied by this application of it, there is no need to give it a reference to that place in which those who do not belong to the city of God are punished in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>. But if any persist in extending its application to the torments of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, let them at least understand it so that the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which has threatened the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, shall abide, but shall be mixed with mercy to the extent of alleviating the torments which might <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> be inflicted; so that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall neither wholly escape, nor only for a time endure these threatened pains, but that they shall be less severe and more endurable than they deserve. Thus the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of God shall continue, and at the same time He will not in this <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> shut up His tender mercies. But even this hypothesis I am not to be supposed to affirm because I do not positively oppose it. </p> 

<p>As for those who find an empty threat rather than a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in such passages as these: <q>Depart from me, you cursed, into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>;</q> and <q>These shall go away into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121555"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41,&nbsp;46</a></span> and <q>They shall be tormented for ever and ever;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121556"><a href="../bible/rev020.htm#verse10">Revelation&nbsp;20:10</a></span> and <q>Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121557"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse24">Isaiah&nbsp;66:24</a></span> &mdash; such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, I say, are most emphatically and abundantly refuted, not by me so much as by the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> itself. For the men of Nineveh repented in this life, and therefore their repentance was fruitful, inasmuch as they sowed in that field which the Lord meant to be sown in tears that it might afterwards be reaped in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. And yet who will deny that God's prediction was fulfilled in their case, if at least he observes that God destroys sinners not only in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> but also in compassion? For sinners are destroyed in two ways&mdash;either, like the Sodomites, the men themselves are punished for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or, like the Ninevites, the men's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are destroyed by repentance. God's prediction, therefore, was fulfilled&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> Nineveh was overthrown, and a good Nineveh built up. For its walls and houses remained standing; the city was overthrown in its depraved manners. And thus, though the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> was provoked that the destruction which the inhabitants dreaded, because of his prediction, did not take place, yet that which God's foreknowledge had predicted did take place, for He who foretold the destruction <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how it should be fulfilled in a less calamitous sense.</p>

<p>But that these perversely compassionate <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> may see what is the purport of these words, <q>How great is the abundance of Your sweetness, Lord, which You have hidden for them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> You,</q>  let them read what follows: <q>And You have perfected it for them that hope in You.</q> For what means, <q>You have hidden it for them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> You,</q> <q>You have perfected it for them that hope in You,</q> unless this, that to those who through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment seek to establish their own righteousness by the law, the righteousness of God is not sweet, because they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it? They have not tasted it. For they hope in themselves, not in Him; and therefore God's abundant sweetness is hidden from them. They <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, indeed, but it is with that servile <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <q>which is not in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; for perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> casts out <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121559"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:18</a></span> Therefore to them that hope in Him He perfects His sweetness, inspiring them with His own <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, so that with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> does not cast out, but which endures for ever, they may, when they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord. For the righteousness of God is Christ, <q>who is of God made unto us,</q> as the apostle says, <q>wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: as it is written, He that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a>, let him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121560"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse30">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:30-31</a></span> This righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> without merits, is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by those who go about to establish their own righteousness, and are therefore not subject to the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note121561"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;10:3</a></span> But it is in this righteousness that we find the great abundance of God's sweetness, of which the psalm says, <q>Taste and see how sweet the Lord is.</q>  And this we rather taste than partake of to satiety in this our pilgrimage. We hunger and thirst for it now, that hereafter we may be satisfied with it when we see Him as He is, and that is fulfilled which is written, <q>I shall be satisfied when Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall be manifested.</q>  It is thus that Christ perfects the great abundance of His sweetness to them that hope in Him. But if God conceals His sweetness from them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him in the sense that these our objectors fancy, so that men's <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of His purpose of mercy towards the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> may lead them to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him and live better, and so that there may be <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> made for those who are not living as they ought, how then does He perfect His sweetness to them that hope in Him, since, if their dreams be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it is this very sweetness which will prevent Him from punishing those who do not hope in Him? Let us then seek that sweetness of His, which He perfects to them that hope in Him, not that which He is supposed to perfect to those who despise and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> Him; for in vain, after this life, does a man seek for what he has neglected to provide while in this life.</p>

<p>Then, as to that saying of the apostle, <q>For God has concluded all in unbelief, that He may have mercy upon all,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121564"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;11:32</a></span> it does not mean that He will condemn no one; but the foregoing context shows what is meant. The apostle composed the epistle for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who were already <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>; and when he was speaking to them of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who were yet to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, he says, <q>For as you in times past <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief; even so have these also now not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</q> Then he added the words in question with which these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> beguile themselves: <q>For God concluded all in unbelief, that He might have mercy upon all.</q> All whom, if not all those of whom he  was speaking, just as if he had said, <q>Both you and them?</q> God then concluded all those in unbelief, both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, whom He foreknew and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be conformed to the image of His Son, in order that they might be confounded by the bitterness of unbelief, and might repent and believingly turn to the sweetness of God's mercy, and might take up that exclamation of the psalm, <q>How great is the abundance of Your sweetness, O Lord, which You have hidden for them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> You, but have perfected to them that hope,</q> not in themselves, but <q>in You.</q> He has mercy, then, on all the vessels of mercy. And what means <q>all?</q> Both those of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and those of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> whom He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, called, justified, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>: none of these will be condemned by Him; but we cannot say none of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> whatever.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25.&mdash; Whether Those Who Received Heretical Baptism, and Have Afterwards Fallen Away to Wickedness of Life; Or Those Who Have Received Catholic Baptism, But Have Afterwards Passed Over to Heresy and Schism; Or Those Who Have Remained in the Catholic Church in Which They Were Baptized, But Have Continued to Live Immorally&mdash;May Hope Through the Virtue of the Sacraments for the Remission of Eternal Punishment.</h2>

<p>But let us now reply to those who promise deliverance from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, not to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (as neither do they of whom we have been speaking), nor even to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> whatever, but only to those who have been washed by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and have become partakers of His body and blood, no matter how they have lived, no matter what <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or impiety they have fallen into. But they are contradicted by the apostle, where he says, <q>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, <a href="../cathen/15674b.htm">witchcraft</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, variances, emulations, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, strife, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, envyings, <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, revellings, and the like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, for they which do such things shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121565"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians&nbsp;5:19-21</a></span> Certainly this sentence of the apostle is false, if such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> shall be delivered after any lapse of time, and shall then inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. But as it is not false, they shall certainly never inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. And if they shall never enter that kingdom, then they shall always be retained in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment; for there is no middle place where he may live unpunished who has not been admitted into that kingdom.</p>

<p>And therefore we may reasonably inquire how we are to understand these words of the Lord Jesus: <q>This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121566"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse50">John&nbsp;6:50-51</a></span> And those, indeed, whom we are now answering, are refuted in their interpretation of this passage by those whom we are shortly to answer, and who do not promise this deliverance to all who have received the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the Lord's body, but only to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, however wickedly they live; for these, say they, have eaten the Lord's body not only sacramentally, but really, being constituted members of His body, of which the apostle says, <q>We being many are one bread, one body.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121567"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:17</a></span> He then who is in the unity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body (that is to say, in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> membership), of which body the faithful have been wont to receive the sacrament at the altar, that man is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said to eat the body and drink the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And consequently <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics being separate from the unity of this body, are able to receive the same sacrament, but with no profit to themselves&mdash;nay, rather to their own hurt, so that they are rather more severely judged than liberated after some time. For they are not in that bond of peace which is symbolized by that sacrament.</p>

<p>But again, even those who sufficiently understand that he who is not in the body of Christ cannot be said to eat the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> when they promise liberation from the fire of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who fall away from the unity of that body into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, or even into heathenish <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. For, in the first place, they ought to consider how intolerable it is, and how discordant with sound doctrine, to suppose that many, indeed, or almost all, who have forsaken the Catholic Church, and have originated impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and become heresiarchs, should enjoy a destiny superior to those who never were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but have fallen into the snares of these others; that is to say, if the fact of their Catholic <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and original reception of the sacrament of the body of Christ in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> body of Christ is sufficient to deliver these heresiarchs from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment. For certainly he who deserts the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and from a deserter becomes an assailant, is worse than he who has not  deserted the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he never held. And, in the second place, they are contradicted by the apostle, who, after enumerating the works of the flesh, says with reference to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, <q>They who do such things shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q></p>

<p>And therefore neither ought such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as lead an abandoned and damnable life to be confident of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, though they persevere to the end in the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> catholic, and comfort themselves with the words, <q>He that endures to the end shall be saved.</q> By the iniquity of their life they abandon that very righteousness of life which Christ is to them, whether it be by fornication, or by perpetrating in their body the other uncleannesses which the apostle would not so much as mention, or by a dissolute luxury, or by doing any one of those things of which he says, <q>They who do such things shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> Consequently, they who do such things shall not exist anywhere but in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, since they cannot be in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. For, while they continue in such things to the very end of life, they cannot be said to abide in Christ to the end; for to abide in Him is to abide in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, according to the apostle's definition of it, <q>works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121568"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> And <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> as he elsewhere says, <q>works no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121569"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;13:10</a></span> Neither can these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> be said to eat the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for they cannot even be reckoned among His members. For, not to mention other reasons, they cannot be at once the members of Christ and the members of a harlot. In fine, He Himself, when He says, <q>He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121570"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse56">John&nbsp;6:56</a></span> shows what it is in reality, and not sacramentally, to eat His body and drink His blood; for this is to dwell in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that He also may dwell in us. So that it is as if He said, He that dwells not in me, and in whom I do not dwell, let him not say or think that he eats my body or drinks my blood. Accordingly, they who are not Christ's members do not dwell in Him. And they who make themselves members of a harlot, are not members of Christ unless they have penitently abandoned that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and have returned to this good to be reconciled to it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.&mdash; What It is to Have Christ for a Foundation, and Who They are to Whom Salvation as by Fire is Promised.</h2>

<p>But, say they, the Catholic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> have Christ for a foundation, and they have not fallen away from union with Him, no matter how depraved a life they have built on this foundation, as wood, hay, stubble; and accordingly the well-directed <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by which Christ is their foundation will suffice to deliver them some time from the continuance of that fire, though it be with loss, since those things they have built on it shall be burned. Let the Apostle James summarily reply to them: <q>If any man say he has <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and have not works, can <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> save him?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121571"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse14">James&nbsp;2:14</a></span> And who then is it, they ask, of whom the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says, <q>But he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire?</q>  Let us join them in their inquiry; and one thing is very certain, that it is not he of whom James speaks, else we should make the two <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> contradict one another, if the one says, <q>Though a man's works be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will save him as by fire,</q> while the other says, <q>If he have not good works, can his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> save him?</q></p>

<p>We shall then ascertain who it is who can be saved by fire, if we first discover what it is to have Christ for a foundation. And this we may very readily learn from the image itself. In a building the foundation is first. Whoever, then, has Christ in his heart, so that no earthly or temporal things&mdash; not even those that are legitimate and allowed&mdash; are preferred to Him, has Christ as a foundation. But if these things be preferred, then even though a man seem to have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, yet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not the foundation to that man; and much more if he, in contempt of wholesome precepts, seek forbidden gratifications, is he clearly convicted of putting Christ not first but last, since he has despised Him as his ruler, and has preferred to fulfill his own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, in contempt of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> commands and allowances. Accordingly, if any <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man loves a harlot, and, attaching himself to her, becomes one body, he has not now Christ for a foundation. But if any one loves his own wife, and loves her as Christ would have him <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> her, who can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he has Christ for a foundation? But if he loves her in the world's fashion, carnally, as the disease of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> prompts him, and as the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even this the apostle, or rather Christ by the apostle, allows as a venial fault. And therefore even such a man may have Christ for a foundation. For so long as he does not prefer such an affection or pleasure to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Christ is his foundation, though on it he builds wood, hay,  stubble; and therefore he shall be saved as by fire. For the fire of affliction shall burn such luxurious pleasures and earthly loves, though they be not damnable, because enjoyed in lawful wedlock. And of this fire the fuel is bereavement, and all those calamities which consume these joys. Consequently the superstructure will be loss to him who has built it, for he shall not retain it, but shall be agonized by the loss of those things in the enjoyment of which he found pleasure. But by this fire he shall be saved through <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the foundation, because even if a persecutor demanded whether he would retain Christ or these things, he would prefer Christ. Would you hear, in the apostle's own words, who he is who builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones? <q>He that is unmarried,</q> he says, <q>cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121573"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse32">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:32</a></span> Would you hear who he is that builds wood, hay, stubble? But he that is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife. <span class="stiki" id="note121574"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse33">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:33</a></span> <q>Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it,</q>&mdash; the day, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, of tribulation&mdash; <q>because,</q> says he, <q>it shall be revealed by fire.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121575"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:13</a></span> He calls tribulation fire, just as it is elsewhere said, <q>The furnace proves the vessels of the potter, and the trial of affliction righteous men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121576"><a href="../bible/sir027.htm#verse5">Sirach&nbsp;27:5</a></span> And <q>The fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work abide</q>&mdash; for a man's care for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord, abides&mdash; <q>which he has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward,</q>&mdash; that is, he shall reap the fruit of his care. <q>But if any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss,</q>&mdash; for what he loved he shall not retain:&mdash; <q> but he himself shall be saved,</q>&mdash; for no tribulation shall have moved him from that stable foundation&mdash;<q>yet so as by fire;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121577"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:14-15</a></span> for that which he possessed with the sweetness of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> he does not lose without the sharp sting of pain. Here, then, as seems to me, we have a fire which destroys neither, but enriches the one, brings loss to the other, proves both.</p>

<p>But if this passage [of Corinthians] is to interpret that fire of which the Lord shall say to those on His left hand, <q>Depart from me, you cursed, into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121578"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> so that among these we are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> there are those who build on the foundation wood, hay, stubble, and that they, through <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the good foundation, shall after a time be liberated from the fire that is the award of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deserts, what then shall we think of those on the right hand, to whom it shall be said, <q>Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121579"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;25:34</a></span> unless that they are those who have built on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones? &nbsp;But if the fire of which our Lord speaks is the same as that of which the apostle says, <q>Yet so as by fire,</q> then both&mdash; that is to say, both those on the right as well as those on the left&mdash; are to be cast into it. For that fire is to try both, since it is said, <q>For the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121580"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:13</a></span> If, therefore, the fire shall try both, in order that if any man's work abide&mdash; <em>i.e</em>., if the superstructure be not consumed by the fire&mdash; he may receive a reward, and that if his work is burned he may suffer loss, certainly that fire is not the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> itself. For into this latter fire only those on the left hand shall be cast, and that with final and everlasting doom; but that former fire proves those on the right hand. But some of them it so proves that it does not burn and consume the structure which is found to have been built by them on Christ as the foundation; while others of them it proves in another fashion, so as to burn what they have built up, and thus <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to suffer loss, while they themselves are saved because they have retained Christ, who was laid as their sure foundation, and have loved Him above all. But if they are saved, then certainly they shall stand at the right hand, and shall with the rest hear the sentence, <q>Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you;</q> and not at the left hand, where those shall be who shall not be saved, and shall therefore hear the doom, <q>Depart from me, you cursed, into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>.</q> For from that fire no man shall be saved, because they all shall go away into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, where their worms shall not die, nor their fire be quenched, in which they shall be tormented day and night for ever.</p>

<p>But if it be said that in the interval of time between the death of this body and that last day of judgment and retribution which shall follow the resurrection, the bodies of the dead shall be exposed to a fire of such a nature that it shall not affect those who have not in this life indulged in such pleasures and pursuits as shall be consumed like wood, hay, stubble, but shall affect those others who have carried with them structures of that kind; if  it be said that such worldliness, being venial, shall be consumed in the fire of tribulation either here only, or here and hereafter both, or here that it may not be hereafter&mdash;this I do not contradict, because possibly it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For perhaps even the death of the body is itself a part of this tribulation, for it results from the first transgression, so that the time which follows death takes its color in each case from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the man's building. The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, too, which have crowned the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of all kinds suffer, try both buildings like a fire, consuming some, along with the builders themselves, if Christ is not found in them as their foundation, while others they consume without the builders, because Christ is found in them, and they are saved, though with loss; and other buildings still they do not consume, because such materials as abide for ever are found in them. In the end of the world there shall be in the time of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> tribulation such as has never before been. How many edifices there shall then be, of gold or of hay, built on the best foundation, Christ Jesus, which that fire shall prove, bringing <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to some, loss to others, but without destroying either sort, because of this stable foundation! But whosoever prefers, I do not say his wife, with whom he lives for carnal pleasure, but any of those <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> who afford no delight of such a kind, and whom it is right to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>&mdash;whosoever prefers these to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and loves them after a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and carnal fashion, has not Christ as a foundation, and will therefore not be saved by fire, nor indeed at all; for he shall not possibly dwell with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, who says very explicitly concerning this very matter, <q>He that loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121581"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;10:37</a></span> But he who loves his relations carnally, and yet so that he does not prefer them to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but would rather want them than Christ if he were put to the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, shall be saved by fire, because it is necessary that by the loss of these relations he suffer pain in proportion to his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And he who loves father, mother, sons, daughters, according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so that he aids them in obtaining His kingdom and cleaving to Him, or loves them because they are members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, God forbid that this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> should be consumed as wood, hay, stubble, and not rather be reckoned a structure of gold, silver, precious stones. For how can a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those more than Christ whom he loves only for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake?</p>

<h2>Chapter 27.&mdash; Against the Belief of Those Who Think that the Sins Which Have Been Accompanied with Almsgiving Will Do Them No Harm.</h2>

<p>It remains to reply to those who maintain that those only shall burn in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> who neglect <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a> proportioned to their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, resting this opinion on the words of the Apostle James, <q>He shall have judgment without mercy that has showed no mercy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121582"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse13">James&nbsp;2:13</a></span> Therefore, they say, he that has showed mercy, though he has not reformed his dissolute conduct, but has lived wickedly and iniquitously even while abounding in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, shall have a merciful judgment, so that he shall either be not condemned at all, or shall be delivered from final judgment after a time. And for the same reason they suppose that Christ will discriminate between those on the right hand and those on the left, and will send the one party into His kingdom, the other into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, on the sole ground of their attention to or neglect of works of charity. Moreover, they endeavor to use the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which the Lord Himself taught as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> and bulwark of their opinion, that daily <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are never abandoned can be expiated through <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>, no matter how offensive or of what sort they be. For, say they, as there is no day on which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> ought not to use this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, so there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of any kind which, though committed every day, is not remitted when we say, <q>Forgive us our debts,</q> if we take care to fulfill what follows, <q>as we forgive our debtors.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121583"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> For, they go on to say, the Lord does not say, <q>If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will forgive you your little daily <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q> but <q>will forgive you your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> Therefore, be they of any kind or magnitude whatever, be they perpetrated daily and never abandoned or subdued in this life, they can be pardoned, they presume, through <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>.</p>

<p>But they are right to inculcate the giving of aims proportioned to past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for if they said that any kind of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> could obtain the divine pardon of great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed daily and with habitual enormity, if they said that such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> could thus be daily remitted, they would see that their doctrine was absurd and ridiculous. For they would thus be driven to acknowledge that it were possible for a very <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> man to buy absolution from murders, adulteries, and all manner of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, by paying a daily <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of ten paltry coins. And if it be most absurd and insane to make such an acknowledgment, and if we still ask what  are those fitting <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of which even the forerunner of Christ said, <q>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121584"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;3:8</a></span> undoubtedly it will be found that they are not such as are done by men who undermine their life by daily enormities even to the very end. For they suppose that by giving to the poor a small fraction of the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> they acquire by extortion and spoliation they can propitiate Christ, so that they may with impunity commit the most damnable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in the persuasion that they have bought from Him a license to transgress, or rather do buy a daily indulgence. And if they for one crime have distributed all their goods to Christ's needy members, that could profit them nothing unless they desisted from all similar actions, and attained charity which works no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> He therefore who does <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a> proportioned to his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> must first begin with himself. For it is not reasonable that a man who exercises charity towards his neighbor should not do so towards himself, since he hears the Lord saying, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbor as yourself,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121585"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;22:39</a></span> and again, <q>Have compassion on your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and please God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121586"><a href="../bible/sir030.htm#verse24">Sirach&nbsp;30:24</a></span> He then who has not compassion on his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that he may please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how can he be said to do <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a> proportioned to his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? To the same purpose is that written, <q>He who is bad to himself, to whom can he be good?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121587"><a href="../bible/sir021.htm#verse1">Sirach&nbsp;21:1</a></span> We ought therefore to do <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> that we may be heard when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that our past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be forgiven, not that while we continue in them we may think to provide ourselves with a license for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> by <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>.</p>

<p>The reason, therefore, of our predicting that He will impute to those on His right hand the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a> they have done, and charge those on His left with omitting the same, is that He may thus show the efficacy of charity for the deletion of past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, not for impunity in their perpetual commission. And such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, indeed, as decline to abandon their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> habits of life for a better course cannot be said to do charitable <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. For this is the purport of the saying, <q>Inasmuch as you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121588"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;25:45</a></span> He shows them that they do not perform charitable actions even when they think they are doing so. For if they gave bread to a hungering <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> because he is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, assuredly they would not deny to themselves the bread of righteousness, that is, Christ Himself; for God considers not the person to whom the gift is made, but the spirit in which it is made. He therefore who loves Christ in a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> extends <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to him in the same spirit in which he draws near to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not in that spirit which would abandon Christ if it could do so with impunity. For in proportion as a man loves what Christ disapproves does he himself abandon Christ. For what does it profit a man that he is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, if he is not justified? Did not He who said, <q>Unless a man be born of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he shall not enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121589"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;3:5</a></span> say also, <q>Unless your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, you shall not enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121590"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;5:20</a></span> Why do many through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the first saying run to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, while few through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the second seek to be justified? As therefore it is not to his brother a man says, <q>You fool,</q> if when he says it he is indignant not at the brotherhood, but at the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the offender&mdash;for otherwise he were guilty of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> fire&mdash;so he who extends charity to a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> does not extend it to a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> if he does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ in him. Now he does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ who refuses to be justified in Him. Or, again, if a man has been guilty of this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of calling his brother Fool, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> reviling him without any desire to remove his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, his <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a> go a small way towards expiating this fault, unless he adds to this the remedy of reconciliation which the same passage enjoins. For it is there said, <q>Therefore, if you bring your gift to the altar, and there rememberest that your brother has anything against you; leave there your gift before the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121591"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;5:23-24</a></span> Just so it is a small matter to do <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>, no matter how great they be, for any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so long as the offender continues in the practice of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Then as to the daily <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which the Lord Himself taught, and which is therefore called the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a>, it obliterates indeed the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the day, when day by day we say, <q>Forgive us our debts,</q> and when we not only say but act out that which follows, <q>as we forgive our debtors;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121592"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> but we utter this petition because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have been committed, and not that they may be. For by it our Saviour designed to teach us that, however righteously we live in this life of infirmity and darkness, we still commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> for the remission of which we ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, while we must pardon those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against us that we ourselves also may be pardoned. The Lord then did not utter the words, <q>If you forgive men their trespasses, your Father will also forgive you your trespasses,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121593"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;6:14</a></span> in order that we might  contract from this petition such confidence as should enable us to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> securely from day to day, either putting ourselves above the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, or craftily deceiving men concerning our conduct, but in order that we might thus learn not to suppose that we are without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, even though we should be free from crimes; as also God admonished the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the old law to this same effect regarding their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, which He commanded them to offer first for their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and then for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the people. For even the very words of so great a Master and Lord are to be intently considered. For He does not say, If you forgive men their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, your Father will also forgive you your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, no matter of what sort they be, but He says, your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for it was a daily <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> He was teaching, and it was certainly to <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> already justified He was speaking. What, then, does He mean by <q>your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q> but those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from which not even you who are justified and sanctified can be free? While, then, those who seek occasion from this petition to indulge in habitual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> maintain that the Lord meant to include great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because He did not say, He will forgive you your small <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but <q>your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q> we, on the other hand, taking into account the character of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> He was addressing, cannot see our way to interpret the expression <q>your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></q> of anything but small <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are no longer guilty of great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Nevertheless not even great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> themselves&mdash; <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from which we must flee with a total reformation of life&mdash; are forgiven to those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, unless they observe the appended precept, <q>as you also forgive your debtors.</q> For if the very small <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which attach even to the life of the righteous be not remitted without that condition, how much further from obtaining indulgence shall those be who are involved in many great crimes, if, while they cease from perpetrating such enormities, they still inexorably refuse to remit any debt incurred to themselves, since the Lord says, <q>But if you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121594"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;6:15</a></span> For this is the purport of the saying of the Apostle James also, <q>He shall have judgment without mercy that has showed no mercy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121595"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse13">James&nbsp;2:13</a></span> For we should remember that servant whose debt of ten thousand talents his lord cancelled, but afterwards ordered him to pay up, because the servant himself had no pity for his fellow-servant, who owed him an hundred pence. <span class="stiki" id="note121596"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;18:23</a></span> The words which the Apostle James subjoins,<q>And mercy rejoices against judgment,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121597"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse13">James&nbsp;2:13</a></span> find their application among those who are the children of the promise and vessels of mercy. For even those righteous men, who have lived with such <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> that they receive into the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> habitations others also who have won their friendship with the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of unrighteousness, <span class="stiki" id="note121598"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;16:9</a></span> became such only through the merciful deliverance of Him who justifies the ungodly, imputing to him a reward according to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not according to debt. For among this number is the apostle, who says, <q>I obtained mercy to be faithful.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121599"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:25</a></span> </p>

<p>But it must be admitted, that those who are thus received into the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> habitations are not of such a character that their own life would suffice to rescue them without the aid of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and consequently in their case especially does mercy <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> against judgment. And yet we are not on this account to suppose that every abandoned profligate, who has made no amendment of his life, is to be received into the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> habitations if only he has assisted the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> with the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of unrighteousness&mdash;that is to say, with money or <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> which has been <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> acquired, or, if rightfully acquired, is yet not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> riches, but only what iniquity counts riches, because it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> riches in which those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> abound, who even receive others also into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> habitations. There is then a certain kind of life, which is neither, on the one hand, so bad that those who adopt it are not helped towards the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> by any bountiful <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> by which they may relieve the wants of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and make friends who could receive them into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> habitations, nor, on the other hand, so good that it of itself suffices to win for them that great blessedness, if they do not obtain mercy through the merits of those whom they have made their friends. And I frequently wonder that even Virgil should give expression to this sentence of the Lord, in which He says, <q>Make to yourselves friends of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of unrighteousness, that they may receive you into everlasting habitations;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121600"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;16:9</a></span> and this very similar saying, <q>He that receives a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, in the name of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, shall receive a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> reward; and he that receives a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121601"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;10:41</a></span> For when that poet described the Elysian fields, in which they suppose that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the blessed dwell, he placed there not only those who had been able by their own merit to reach that abode, but added&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>And they who grateful memory won
<br>By services to others done; 
</p></blockquote>

<p>  that is, they who had served others, and thereby merited to be remembered by them. Just as if they used the expression so common in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> lips, where some <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> person commends himself to one of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and says, Remember me, and secures that he do so by deserving well at his hand. But what that kind of life we have been speaking of is, and what those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are which prevent a man from winning the kingdom of God by himself, but yet permit him to avail himself of the merits of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, it is very difficult to ascertain, very perilous to define. For my own part, in spite of all investigation, I have been up to the present hour unable to discover this. And possibly it is hidden from us, lest we should become careless in avoiding such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and so cease to make progress. For if it were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are which, though they continue, and be not abandoned for a higher life, do yet not prevent us from seeking and hoping for the intercession of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sloth would presumptuously wrap itself in these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and would take no steps to be disentangled from such wrappings by the deft energy of any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but would only desire to be rescued by the merits of other people, whose friendship had been won by a bountiful use of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of unrighteousness. But now that we are left in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the precise nature of that iniquity which is venial, even though it be persevered in, certainly we are both more vigilant in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and efforts for progress, and more careful to secure with the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of unrighteousness friends for ourselves among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;But this deliverance, which is effected by one's own <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, or the intercession of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, secures that a man be not cast into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, but not that, when once he has been cast into it, he should after a time be rescued from it. For even those who fancy that what is said of the good ground bringing forth abundant fruit, some thirty, some sixty, some an hundred fold, is to be referred to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, so that in proportion to their merits some of them shall deliver thirty men, some sixty, some an hundred&mdash;even those who maintain this are yet commonly inclined to suppose that this deliverance will take place at, and not after the day of judgment. Under this impression, some one who observed the unseemly folly with which men promise themselves impunity on the ground that all will be included in this method of deliverance, is reported to have very happily remarked, that we should rather endeavor to live so well that we shall be all found among the number of those who are to intercede for the liberation of others, lest these should be so few in number, that, after they have delivered one thirty, another sixty, another a hundred, there should still remain many who could not be delivered from punishment by their intercessions, and among them every one who has vainly and rashly promised himself the fruit of another's labor. But enough has been said in reply to those who acknowledge the authority of the same sacred Scriptures as ourselves, but who, by a mistaken interpretation of them, conceive of the future rather as they themselves wish, than as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> teach. And having given this reply, I now, according to promise, close this book.</p>
