<h1>The City of God (Book XXII)</h1>

<p class="h1a">This book treats of the end of the city of God, that is to say, of the eternal happiness of the saints; the faith of the resurrection of the body is established and explained; and the work concludes by showing how the saints, clothed in immortal and spiritual bodies, shall be employed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; Of the Creation of Angels and Men.</h2>

<p>As we promised in the immediately preceeding book, this, the last of the whole work, shall contain a discussion of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessedness of the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This blessedness is named <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, not because it shall endure for many ages, though at last it shall come to an end, but because, according to the words of the gospel, <q>of His kingdom there shall be no end.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121603"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;1:33</a></span> Neither shall it enjoy the mere appearance of perpetuity which is maintained by the rise of fresh generations to occupy the place of those that have died out, as in an evergreen the same freshness seems to continue permanently, and the same appearance of dense foliage is preserved by the growth of fresh leaves in the room of those that have withered and fallen; but in that city all the citizens shall be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, men now for the first time enjoying what the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have never lost. And this shall be accomplished by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the most almighty Founder of the city. For He has promised it, and cannot lie, and has already performed many of His promises, and has done many unpromised kindnesses to those whom He now asks to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He will do this also.</p>

<p>For it is He who in the beginning created the world full of all visible and intelligible beings, among which He created nothing better than those spirits whom He endowed with intelligence, and made capable of contemplating and enjoying Him, and united in our society, which we call the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and heavenly city, and in which the material of their sustenance and blessedness is God Himself, as it were their common food and nourishment. It is He who gave to this intellectual nature <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> of such a kind, that if he wished to forsake <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em> i.e</em>., his blessedness, misery should immediately result. It is He who, when He foreknew that certain <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> would in their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> desire to suffice for their own blessedness, and would forsake their great good, did not deprive them of this power, deeming it to be more befitting His power and goodness to bring good out of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than to prevent the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from coming into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. And indeed <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> had never been, had not the mutable nature&mdash; mutable, though good, and created by the most high God and immutable Good, who created all things good&mdash; brought <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> upon itself by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And this its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is itself <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that its nature was originally good. For had it not been very good, though not equal to its Creator, the desertion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as its light could not have been an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to it. For as blindness is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of the eye, and this very fact indicates that the eye was created to see the light, and as, consequently, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> itself proves that the eye is more excellent than the other members, because it is capable of light (for on no other supposition would it be a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of the eye to want light), so the nature which once enjoyed God teaches, even by its very <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, that it was created the best of all, since it is now miserable because it does not enjoy God. It is he who with very <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> punishment doomed the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who voluntarily fell to everlasting misery, and rewarded those who continued in their attachment to the supreme good with the assurance of endless stability as the meed of their fidelity. It is He who made also man himself  upright, with the same freedom of will,&mdash; an earthly animal, indeed, but fit for heaven if he remained faithful to his Creator, but destined to the misery appropriate to such a nature if he forsook Him. It is He who when He foreknew that man would in his turn <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by abandoning God and breaking His law, did not deprive him of the power of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, because He at the same time foresaw what good He Himself would bring out of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and how from this mortal race, deservedly and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> condemned, He would by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> collect, as now He does, a people so numerous, that He thus fills up and repairs the blank made by the fallen <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and that thus that beloved and heavenly city is not defrauded of the full number of its citizens, but perhaps may even <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in a still more overflowing population.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.&mdash; Of the Eternal and Unchangeable Will of God.</h2>

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men do many things contrary to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; but so great is His wisdom and power, that all things which seem adverse to His purpose do still tend towards those just and good ends and issues which He Himself has foreknown. And consequently, when God is said to change His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as when, <em>e.g</em>., He becomes <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with those to whom He was gentle, it is rather they than He who are changed, and they find Him changed in so far as their experience of suffering at His hand is new, as the sun is changed to injured eyes, and becomes as it were fierce from being mild, and hurtful from being delightful, though in itself it remains the same as it was. That also is called the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which He does in the hearts of those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> His commandments; and of this the apostle says, <q>For it is God that works in you both to will.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121604"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;2:13</a></span> As God's <q>righteousness</q> is used not only of the righteousness wherewith He Himself is righteous, but also of that which He produces in the man whom He justifies, so also that is called His law, which, though given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is rather the law of men. For certainly they were men to whom Jesus said, <q>It is written in your law,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121605"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;8:17</a></span> though in another place we read, <q>The law of his God is in his heart.</q>  According to this will which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works in men, He is said also to will what He Himself does not will, but causes His people to will; as He is said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what He has caused those to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it. For when the apostle says, <q>But now, after that you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or rather are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121607"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse9">Galatians&nbsp;4:9</a></span> we cannot suppose that God there for the first time <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> those who were foreknown by Him before the foundation of the world; but He is said to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> them then, because then He caused them to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. But I remember that I discussed these modes of expression in the preceding books. According to this will, then, by which we say that God wills what He causes to be willed by others, from whom the future is hidden, He wills many things which He does not perform.</p>

<p>Thus His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, inspired by His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> will, desire many things which never happen. They <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, <em> e.g</em>., for certain individuals&mdash; they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> manner&mdash; but what they request He does not perform, though He Himself by His own <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> has wrought in them this will to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. And consequently, when the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in conformity with God's <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, will and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> be saved, we can use this mode of expression: God wills and does not perform&mdash;meaning that He who causes them to will these things Himself wills them. But if we speak of that will of His which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> as His foreknowledge, certainly He has already done all things in heaven and on earth that He has willed,&mdash; not only past and present things, but even things still future. But before the arrival of that time in which He has willed the occurrence of what He foreknew and arranged before all time, we say, It will happen when God wills. But if we are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> not only of the time in which it is to be, but even whether it shall be at all, we say, It will happen if God wills,&mdash; not because God will then have a new will which He had not before, but because that event, which from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> has been prepared in His unchangeable will, shall then come to pass.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.&mdash; Of the Promise of Eternal Blessedness to the Saints, and Everlasting Punishment to the Wicked.</h2>

<p>Wherefore, not to mention many other instances besides, as we now see in Christ the fulfillment of that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> promised to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> when He said, <q>In your seed shall all nations be blessed,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121608"><a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse18">Genesis&nbsp;22:18</a></span> so this also shall be fulfilled which He promised to the same race, when He said by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>They that are in their sepulchres shall rise again,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121609"><a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;26:19</a></span> and also, <q>There shall be a new heaven and a new earth: and the former shall not be mentioned, nor come into mind; but they shall find <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and rejoicing in it: for I will make Jerusalem a rejoicing, and my people a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. And I will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in Jerusalem, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in  my people, and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121610"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse17">Isaiah&nbsp;65:17-19</a></span> And by another <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> He uttered the same prediction: <q>At that time your people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. And many of them that sleep in the dust</q> (or, as some interpret it, <q>in the mound</q>) <q>of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121611"><a href="../bible/dan012.htm#verse1">Daniel&nbsp;12:1-2</a></span> And in another place by the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and shall possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121612"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse18">Daniel&nbsp;7:18</a></span> And a little after he says, <q>His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121613"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse27">Daniel&nbsp;7:27</a></span> Other prophecies referring to the same subject I have advanced in the twentieth book, and others still which I have not advanced are found written in the same Scriptures; and these predictions shall be fulfilled, as those also have been which unbelieving men supposed would be frustrate. For it is the same God who promised both, and predicted that both would come to pass&mdash;the God whom the pagan deities tremble before, as even Porphyry, the noblest of pagan <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, testifies.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; Against the Wise Men of the World, Who Fancy that the Earthly Bodies of Men Cannot Be Transferred to a Heavenly Habitation.</h2>

<p>But men who use their learning and intellectual ability to resist the force of that great authority which, in fulfillment of what was so long before predicted, has converted all races of men to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope in its promises, seem to themselves to argue acutely against the resurrection of the body while they cite what Cicero mentions in the third book <em>De Republica</em>. For when he was asserting the apotheosis of Hercules and Romulus, he says: <q>Whose bodies were not taken up into heaven; for nature would not permit a body of earth to exist anywhere except upon earth.</q> This, forsooth, is the profound reasoning of the wise men, whose thoughts God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that they are vain. For if we were only <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, that is, spirits without any body, and if we dwelt in heaven and had no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of earthly animals, and were told that we should be bound to earthly bodies by some wonderful bond of union, and should animate them, should we not much more vigorously refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this, and maintain that nature would not permit an incorporeal substance to be held by a corporeal bond? And yet the earth is full of living spirits, to which terrestrial bodies are bound, and with which they are in a wonderful way implicated. If, then, the same God who has created such beings wills this also, what is to hinder the earthly body from being raised to a heavenly body, since a spirit, which is more excellent than all bodies, and consequently than even a heavenly body, has been tied to an earthly body? If so small an earthly particle has been able to hold in union with itself something better than a heavenly body, so as to receive sensation and life, will heaven disdain to receive, or at least to retain, this sentient and living particle, which derives its life and sensation from a substance more excellent than any heavenly body? If this does not happen now, it is because the time is not yet come which has been determined by Him who has already done a much more marvellous thing than that which these men refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For why do we not more intensely wonder that incorporeal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which are of higher rank than heavenly bodies, are bound to earthly bodies, rather than that bodies, although earthly, are exalted to an abode which, though heavenly, is yet corporeal, except because we have been accustomed to see this, and indeed are this, while we are not as yet that other marvel, nor have as yet ever seen it? Certainly, if we consult sober reason, the more wonderful of the two divine works is found to be to attach somehow corporeal things to incorporeal, and not to connect earthly things with heavenly, which, though diverse, are yet both of them corporeal.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.&mdash; Of the Resurrection of the Flesh, Which Some Refuse to Believe, Though the World at Large Believes It.</h2>

<p>But granting that this was once incredible, behold, now, the world has come to the belief that the earthly body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was received up into heaven. Already both the learned and unlearned have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the resurrection of the flesh and its ascension to the heavenly places, while only a very few either of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> or uneducated are still staggered by it. If this is a credible thing which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, then let those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> see how stolid they are; and if it is incredible, then this also is an incredible thing, that what is incredible should have received such credit. Here then we have two incredibles,&mdash; to wit, the resurrection of our body to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and that the world should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> so incredible a thing; and both these incredibles the same God predicted should come to pass before either had as yet occurred. We see that already one of the two has come to pass,  for the world has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> what was incredible; why should we despair that the remaining one shall also come to pass, and that this which the world <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, though it was incredible, shall itself occur? For already that which was equally incredible has come to pass, in the world's believing an incredible thing. Both were incredible: the one we see accomplished, the other we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> shall be; for both were predicted in those same Scriptures by means of which the world <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. And the very manner in which the world's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was won is found to be even more incredible if we consider it. Men uninstructed in any branch of a liberal education, without any of the refinement of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> learning, unskilled in grammar, not armed with dialectic, not adorned with rhetoric, but plain fishermen, and very few in number&mdash;these were the men whom Christ sent with the nets of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the sea of this world, and thus took out of every race so many fishes, and even the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> themselves, wonderful as they are rare. Let us add, if you please, or because you ought to be pleased, this third incredible thing to the two former. And now we have three incredibles, all of which have yet come to pass. It is incredible that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> should have risen in the flesh and ascended with flesh into heaven; it is incredible that the world should have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> so incredible a thing; it is incredible that a very few men, of mean birth and the lowest rank, and no education, should have been able so effectually to persuade the world, and even its learned men, of so incredible a thing. Of these three incredibles, the parties with whom we are debating refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the first; they cannot refuse to see the second, which they are unable to account for if they do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the third. It is indubitable that the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and His ascension into heaven with the flesh in which He rose, is already preached and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the whole world. If it is not credible, how is it that it has already received credence in the whole world? If a number of noble, exalted, and learned men had said that they had witnessed it, and had been at pains to publish what they had witnessed, it were not wonderful that the world should have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it, but it were very stubborn to refuse credence; but if, as is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the world has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> a few obscure, inconsiderable, uneducated <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who state and write that they witnessed it, is it not unreasonable that a handful of wrong-headed men should oppose themselves to the creed of the whole world, and refuse their belief? And if the world has put <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in a small number of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, of mean birth and the lowest rank, and no education, it is because the divinity of the thing itself appeared all the more manifestly in such contemptible witnesses. The eloquence, indeed, which lent persuasion to their message, consisted of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a>, not words. For they who had not seen Christ risen in the flesh, nor ascending into heaven with His risen body, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> those who related how they had seen these things, and who testified not only with words but wonderful signs. For men whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be acquainted with only one, or at most two languages, they marvelled to hear speaking in the tongues of all nations. They saw a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, lame from his mother's womb, after forty years stand up sound at their word in the name of Christ; that handkerchiefs taken from their bodies had <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to heal the sick; that countless <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, sick of various diseases, were laid in a row in the road where they were to pass, that their shadow might fall on them as they walked, and that they immediately received health; that many other stupendous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought by them in the name of Christ; and, finally, that they even raised the dead. If it be admitted that these things occurred as they are related, then we have a multitude of incredible things to add to those three incredibles. That the one incredibility of the resurrection and ascension of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> may be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, we accumulate the testimonies of countless incredible <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but even so we do not bend the frightful obstinacy of these sceptics. But if they do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought by Christ's <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to gain credence to their preaching of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> and ascension, this one grand <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> suffices for us, that the whole world has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> without any <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.&mdash; That Rome Made Its Founder Romulus a God Because It Loved Him; But the Church Loved Christ Because It Believed Him to Be God.</h2>

<p>Let us here recite the passage in which Tully expresses his astonishment that the apotheosis of Romulus should have been credited. I shall insert his words as they stand: <q>It is most worthy of remark in Romulus, that other men who are said to have become gods lived in less <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> ages, when there was a greater propensity to the fabulous, and when the uninstructed were easily persuaded to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> anything. But the age of Romulus was barely six hundred years ago, and already literature and science had dispelled the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> that attach to an uncultured age.</q> And a little after he says of the same Romulus words to this effect:  <q>From this we may perceive that Homer had flourished long before Romulus, and that there was now so much learning in individuals, and so generally diffused an enlightenment, that scarcely any room was left for fable. For antiquity admitted fables, and sometimes even very clumsy ones; but this age [of Romulus] was sufficiently enlightened to reject whatever had not the air of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> Thus one of the most learned men, and certainly the most eloquent, M. Tullius Cicero, says that it is surprising that the divinity of Romulus was <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in, because the times were already so enlightened that they would not accept a fabulous fiction. But who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that Romulus was a god except Rome, which was itself small and in its infancy? Then afterwards it was necessary that succeeding generations should preserve the tradition of their ancestors; that, drinking in this <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> with their mother's milk, the state might grow and come to such power that it might dictate this belief, as from a point of vantage, to all the nations over whom its sway extended. And these nations, though they might not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Romulus was a god, at least said so, that they might not give offense to their sovereign state by refusing to give its founder that title which was given him by Rome, which had adopted this belief, not by a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. But though Christ is the founder of the heavenly and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> city, yet it did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to be God because it was founded by Him, but rather it is founded by Him, in virtue of its belief. Rome, after it had been built and dedicated, worshipped its founder in a temple as a god; but this Jerusalem laid Christ, its <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as its foundation, that the building and dedication might proceed. The former city loved its founder, and therefore <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him to be a god; the latter <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Christ to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore loved Him. There was an antecedent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the former city, and for its believing that even a false dignity attached to the object of its <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; so there was an antecedent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for the belief of the latter, and for its loving the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> dignity which a proper <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not a rash surmise, ascribed to its object. For, not to mention the multitude of very striking <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there were also divine prophecies heralding Him, prophecies most worthy of belief, which being already accomplished, we have not, like the fathers, to wait for their verification. Of Romulus, on the other hand, and of his building Rome and reigning in it, we read or hear the narrative of what did take place, not prediction which beforehand said that such things should be. And so far as his reception among the gods is concerned, history only records that this was <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and does not state it as a fact; for no miraculous signs testified to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this. For as to that wolf which is said to have nursed the twin-brothers, and which is considered a great marvel, how does this prove him to have been divine? For even supposing that this nurse was a real wolf and not a mere courtezan, yet she nursed both brothers, and Remus is not reckoned a god. Besides, what was there to hinder any one from asserting that Romulus or Hercules, or any such man, was a god? Or who would rather choose to die than profess belief in his divinity? And did a single nation worship Romulus among its gods, unless it were forced through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Roman name? But who can number the multitudes who have chosen death in the most cruel shapes rather than deny the divinity of Christ? And thus the dread of some slight indignation, which it was supposed, perhaps groundlessly, might exist in the minds of the Romans, constrained some states who were subject to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to worship Romulus as a god; whereas the dread, not of a slight mental shock, but of severe and various punishments, and of death itself, the most formidable of all, could not prevent an immense multitude of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> throughout the world from not merely worshipping but also confessing Christ as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The city of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which, although as yet a stranger upon earth, had countless hosts of citizens, did not make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon its godless persecutors for the sake of temporal security, but preferred to win <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by abstaining from <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. They were bound, imprisoned, beaten, tortured, burned, torn in pieces, massacred, and yet they multiplied. It was not given to them to fight for their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> except by despising their temporal <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for their Saviour's sake.</p>

<p>I am aware that Cicero, in the third book of his <em>De Republica</em>, if I mistake not, argues that a first-rate power will not engage in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> except either for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> or for safety. What he has to say about the question of safety, and what he means by safety, he explains in another place, saying, <q>Private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> frequently evade, by a speedy death, destitution, exile, bonds, the scourge, and the other pains which even the most insensible feel. But to states, death, which seems to emancipate individuals from all punishments, is itself a punishment; for a state should be so constituted as to be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. And thus death is not natural to a republic as to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to whom death is not only necessary, but often even desirable. But when a state is destroyed,  obliterated, annihilated, it is as if (to compare great things with small) this whole world perished and collapsed.</q> Cicero said this because he, with the Platonists, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the world would not perish. It is therefore agreed that, according to Cicero, a state should engage in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> for the safety which preserves the state permanently in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> though its citizens change; as the foliage of an olive or laurel, or any tree of this kind, is perennial, the old leaves being replaced by fresh ones. For death, as he says, is no punishment to individuals, but rather delivers them from all other punishments, but it is a punishment to the state. And therefore it is reasonably asked whether the Saguntines did right when they chose that their whole state should perish rather than that they should break <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with the Roman republic; for this deed of theirs is applauded by the citizens of the earthly republic. But I do not see how they could follow the advice of Cicero, who tell us that no <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is to be undertaken save for safety or for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; neither does he say which of these two is to be preferred, if a case should occur in which the one could not be preserved without the loss of the other. For manifestly, if the Saguntines chose safety, they must break <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; if they kept <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they must reject safety; as also it fell out. But the safety of the city of God is such that it can be retained, or rather acquired, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be abandoned, no one can attain it. It is this thought of a most steadfast and patient spirit that has made so many noble <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, while Romulus has not had, and could not have, so much as one to die for his divinity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.&mdash; That the World's Belief in Christ is the Result of Divine Power, Not of Human Persuasion.</h2>

<p>But it is thoroughly ridiculous to make mention of the false divinity of Romulus as any way comparable to that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Nevertheless, if Romulus lived about six hundred years before Cicero, in an age which already was so enlightened that it rejected all impossibilities, how much more, in an age which certainly was more enlightened, being six hundred years later, the age of Cicero himself, and of the emperors Augustus and <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, would the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind have refused to listen to or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body and its ascension into heaven, and have scouted it as an impossibility, had not the divinity of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, or the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the divinity, and corroborating miraculous signs, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that it could happen and had happened? Through <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of these testimonies, and notwithstanding the opposition and terror of so many cruel <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, the resurrection and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the flesh, first in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and subsequently in all in the new world, was <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, was intrepidly proclaimed, and was sown over the whole world, to be fertilized richly with the blood of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. For the predictions of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> that had preceded the events were read, they were corroborated by powerful signs, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was seen to be not contradictory to reason, but only different from customary ideas, so that at length the world embraced the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it had furiously <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.&mdash; Of Miracles Which Were Wrought that the World Might Believe in Christ, and Which Have Not Ceased Since the World Believed.</h2>

<p>Why, they say, are those <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, which you affirm were wrought formerly, wrought no longer? I might, indeed, reply that <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were necessary before the world <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, in order that it might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. And whoever now-a-days demands to see prodigies that he may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, is himself a great prodigy, because he does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, though the whole world does. But they make these objections for the sole purpose of insinuating that even those former <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were never wrought. How, then, is it that everywhere Christ is celebrated with such firm belief in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> and ascension? How is it that in enlightened times, in which every impossibility is rejected, the world has, without any <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> things marvellously incredible? Or will they say that these things were credible, and therefore were credited? Why then do they themselves not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? Our argument, therefore, is a summary one&mdash; either incredible things which were not witnessed have caused the world to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> other incredible things which both occurred and were witnessed, or this matter was so credible that it needed no <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of it, and therefore convicts these unbelievers of unpardonable scepticism. This I might say for the sake of refuting these most frivolous objectors. But we cannot deny that many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought to confirm that one grand and health-giving <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> ascension to heaven with the flesh in which He rose. For these most trustworthy books of ours contain in one narrative both the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that were wrought and the creed which they were wrought to confirm. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were published that they might produce <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which they produced brought them into  greater prominence. For they are read in congregations that they may be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and yet they would not be so read unless they were <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. For even now <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are wrought in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whether by His <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> or by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> or relics of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; but they are not so brilliant and conspicuous as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to be published with such <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as accompanied the former <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. For the canon of the sacred writings, which behooved to be closed,  causes those to be everywhere recited, and to sink into the memory of all the congregations; but these modern <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are scarcely <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> even to the whole population in the midst of which they are wrought, and at the best are confined to one spot. For frequently they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only to a very few <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, while all the rest are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of them, especially if the state is a large one; and when they are reported to other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in other localities, there is no sufficient authority to give them prompt and unwavering credence, although they are reported to the faithful by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> which was wrought at Milan when I was there, and by which a blind man was restored to sight, could come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of many; for not only is the city a large one, but also the emperor was there at the time, and the occurrence was witnessed by an immense concourse of people that had gathered to the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> Protasius and Gervasius, which had long lain concealed and unknown, but were now made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Ambrose in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, and discovered by him. By <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of these remains the darkness of that blind man was scattered, and he saw the light of day. </p>

<p>But who but a very small number are aware of the cure which was wrought upon Innocentius, ex-advocate of the deputy prefecture, a cure wrought at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, in my presence, and under my own eyes? For when I and my brother Alypius,  who were not yet clergymen,  though already servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, came from abroad, this man received us, and made us live with him, for he and all his household were devotedly <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>. He was being treated by medical men for fistul&aelig;, of which he had a large number intricately seated in the rectum. He had already undergone an operation, and the surgeons were using every means at their command for his relief. In that operation he had suffered long-continued and acute pain; yet, among the many folds of the gut, one had escaped the operators so entirely, that, though they ought to have laid it open with the knife, they never touched it. And thus, though all those that had been opened were cured, this one remained as it was, and frustrated all their labor. The patient, having his suspicions awakened by the delay thus occasioned, and fearing greatly a second operation, which another medical man&mdash; one of his own domestics&mdash; had told him he must undergo, though this man had not even been allowed to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> the first operation, and had been banished from the house, and with difficulty allowed to come back to his enraged master's presence&mdash;the patient, I say, broke out to the surgeons, saying, <q>Are you going to cut me again? Are you, after all, to fulfill the prediction of that man whom you would not allow even to be present?</q> The surgeons laughed at the unskillful doctor, and soothed their patient's fears with fair words and promises. So several days passed, and yet nothing they tried did him good. Still they persisted in promising that they would cure that fistula by drugs, without the knife. They called in also another old practitioner of great repute in that department, Ammonius (for he was still alive at that time); and he, after examining the part, promised the same result as themselves from their care and skill. On this great authority, the patient became confident, and, as if already well, vented his good spirits in facetious remarks at the expense of his domestic physician, who had predicted a second operation. To make a long story short, after a number of days had thus uselessly elapsed, the surgeons, wearied and confused, had at last to confess that he could only be cured by the knife. Agitated with excessive <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, he was terrified, and grew pale with dread; and when he collected himself and was able to speak, he ordered them to go away and never to return. Worn out with weeping, and driven by necessity, it occurred to him to call in an <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a>, who was at that time esteemed a wonderfully skillful operator, that he might perform the operation his rage would not suffer them to do. But when he had come, and examined with a professional eye the traces  of their careful work, he acted the part of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, and persuaded his patient to allow those same hands the satisfaction of finishing his cure which had begun it with a skill that excited his admiration, adding that there was no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> his only hope of a cure was by an operation, but that it was thoroughly inconsistent with his nature to win the credit of the cure by doing the little that remained to be done, and rob of their reward men whose consummate skill, care, and diligence he could not but admire when be saw the traces of their work. They were therefore again received to favor; and it was agreed that, in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a>, they should operate on the fistula, which, by the consent of all, could now only be cured by the knife. The operation was deferred till the following day. But when they had left, there arose in the house such a wailing, in sympathy with the excessive despondency of the master, that it seemed to us like the mourning at a funeral, and we could scarcely repress it. Holy men were in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of visiting him daily; Saturninus of blessed memory, at that time <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Uzali, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Gelosus, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> of the church of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>; and among these was the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Aurelius, who alone of them all survives&mdash;a man to be named by us with due reverence&mdash;and with him I have often spoken of this affair, as we conversed together about the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and I have found that he distinctly remembers what I am now relating. When these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> visited him that evening according to their custom, he besought them, with pitiable tears, that they would do him the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of being present next day at what he judged his funeral rather than his suffering. For such was the terror his former pains had produced, that he made no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he would die in the hands of the surgeons. They comforted him, and exhorted him to put his trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and nerve his will like a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Then we went to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; but while we, in the usual way, were kneeling and bending to the ground, he cast himself down, as if some one were hurling him violently to the earth, and began to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; but in what a manner, with what earnestness and emotion, with what a flood of tears, with what groans and sobs, that shook his whole body, and almost prevented him speaking, who can describe! Whether the others <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and had not their attention wholly diverted by this conduct, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. For myself, I could not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> at all. This only I briefly said in my heart: <q>O Lord, what <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Your people do You hear if You hear not these?</q> For it seemed to me that nothing could be added to this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, unless he expired in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>. We rose from our knees, and, receiving the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, departed, the patient beseeching his visitors to be present next morning, they exhorting him to keep up his heart. The dreaded day dawned. The servants of God were present, as they had promised to be; the surgeons arrived; all that the circumstances required was ready; the frightful instruments are produced; all look on in wonder and suspense. While those who have most influence with the patient are cheering his fainting spirit, his limbs are arranged on the couch so as to suit the hand of the operator; the knots of the bandages are untied; the part is bared; the surgeon examines it, and, with knife in hand, eagerly looks for the sinus that is to be cut. He searches for it with his eyes; he feels for it with his finger; he applies every kind of scrutiny: he finds a perfectly firm cicatrix! No words of mine can describe the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and praise, and thanksgiving to the merciful and almighty God which was poured from the lips of all, with tears of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>. Let the scene be imagined rather than described!</p>

<p>In the same city of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> lived Innocentia, a very devout <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of the highest rank in the state. She had cancer in one of her breasts, a disease which, as physicians say, is incurable. Ordinarily, therefore, they either amputate, and so separate from the body the member on which the disease has seized, or, that the patient's life may be prolonged a little, though death is inevitable even if somewhat delayed, they abandon all remedies, following, as they say, the advice of Hippocrates. This the lady we speak of had been advised to by a skillful physician, who was intimate with her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; and she betook herself to God alone by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. On the approach of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, she was instructed in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> to wait for the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that came out from the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a>  after being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and to ask her to make the sign of Christ upon her sore. She did so, and was immediately cured. The physician who had advised her to apply no remedy if she wished to live a little longer, when he had examined her after this, and found that she who, on his former examination, was afflicted with that disease was now perfectly cured, eagerly asked her what remedy she had used, anxious, as we may well <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, to discover the drug which should defeat the decision of Hippocrates. But when she told him what had happened, he is said to have replied, with religious  politeness, though with a contemptuous tone, and an expression which made her <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> he would utter some <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>I thought you would make some great discovery to me.</q> She, shuddering at his indifference, quickly replied, <q>What great thing was it for Christ to heal a cancer, who raised one who had been four days dead?</q> When, therefore, I had heard this, I was extremely indignant that so great a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> wrought in that well-known city, and on a person who was certainly not obscure, should not be divulged, and I considered that she should be spoken to, if not reprimanded on this score. And when she replied to me that she had not kept silence on the subject, I asked the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> with whom she was best acquainted whether they had ever heard of this before. They told me they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing of it. <q>See,</q> I said, <q>what your not keeping silence amounts to, since not even those who are so familiar with you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of it.</q> And as I had only briefly heard the story, I made her tell how the whole thing happened, from beginning to end, while the other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> listened in great astonishment, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> God.</p>

<p>A gouty doctor of the same city, when he had given in his name for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and had been prohibited the day before his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> from being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> that year, by black woolly-haired boys who appeared to him in his dreams, and whom he understood to be devils, and when, though they trod on his feet, and inflicted the acutest pain he had ever yet experienced, he refused to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> them, but overcame them, and would not defer being washed in the laver of regeneration, was relieved in the very act of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, not only of the extraordinary pain he was tortured with, but also of the disease itself, so that, though he lived a long time afterwards, he never suffered from gout; and yet who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>? We, however, do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, and so, too, do the small number of brethren who were in the neighborhood, and to whose ears it might come.</p>

<p>An old comedian of Curubis  was cured at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> not only of paralysis, but also of hernia, and, being delivered from both afflictions, came up out of the font of regeneration as if he had had nothing wrong with his body. Who outside of Curubis <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of this, or who but a very few who might hear it elsewhere? But we, when we heard of it, made the man come to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, by order of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Aurelius, although we had already ascertained the fact on the information of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whose word we could not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>.</p>

<p>Hesperius, of a tribunitian <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and a neighbor of our own,  has a farm called Zubedi in the Fussalian district;  and, finding that his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, his cattle, and his servants were suffering from the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, he asked our <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, during my absence, that one of them would go with him and banish the spirits by his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. One went, offered there the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> with all his might that that vexation might cease. It did cease immediately, through God's mercy. Now he had received from a friend of his own some <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> earth brought from Jerusalem, where Christ, having been buried, rose again the third day. This earth he had hung up in his bedroom to preserve himself from harm. But when his house was purged of that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demoniacal</a> invasion, he began to consider what should be done with the earth; for his reverence for it made him unwilling to have it any longer in his bedroom. It so happened that I and Maximinus <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Synita, and then my colleague, were in the neighborhood. Hesperius asked us to visit him, and we did so. When he had related all the circumstances, he begged that the earth might be buried somewhere, and that the spot should be made a place of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> where <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> might assemble for the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We made no objection: it was done as he desired. There was in that neighborhood a young countryman who was paralytic, who, when he heard of this, begged his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to take him without delay to that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place. When he had been brought there, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and immediately went away on his own feet perfectly cured.</p>

<p>There is a country-seat called Victoriana, less than thirty miles from Hippo-regius. At it there is a monument to the Milanese <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, Protasius and Gervasius. Thither a young man was carried, who, when he was watering his horse one summer day at noon in a pool of a river, had been taken possession of by a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. As he lay at the monument, near death, or even quite like a dead person, the lady of the manor, with her maids and religious attendants, entered the place for evening <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and praise, as her custom was, and they began to sing <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. At this sound the young man, as if electrified, was thoroughly aroused, and with frightful screaming seized the altar, and held it as if he did not dare or were not able to let it go, and as if he were fixed or tied to it; and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in him, with loud lamentation, besought that he might be spared, and confessed where and when and how he took possession of the youth.  At last, declaring that he would go out of him, he named one by one the parts of his body which he threatened to mutilate as he went out and with these words he departed from the man. But his eye, falling out on his cheek, hung by a slender vein as by a root, and the whole of the pupil which had been black became white. When this was witnessed by those present (others too had now gathered to his cries, and had all joined in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for him), although they were delighted that he had recovered his sanity of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, yet, on the other hand, they were grieved about his eye, and said he should seek medical advice. But his sister's husband, who had brought him there, said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has banished the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, is able to restore his eye at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</q> Therewith he replaced the eye that was fallen out and hanging, and bound it in its place with his handkerchief as well as he could, and advised him not to loose the bandage for seven days. When he did so, he found it quite healthy. Others also were cured there, but of them it were tedious to speak.</p>

<p>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of Hippo was immediately dispossessed of a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, on anointing herself with oil, mixed with the tears of the prebsyter who had been <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for her. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> once <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for a <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniac</a> young man whom he never saw, and that he was cured on the spot.</p>

<p>There was a fellow-townsman of ours at Hippo, Florentius, an old man, religious and poor, who supported himself as a tailor. Having lost his coat, and not having means to buy another, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the Twenty Martyrs,  who have a very celebrated memorial shrine in our town, begging in a distinct voice that he might be clothed. Some scoffing young men, who happened to be present, heard him, and followed him with their sarcasm as he went away, as if he had asked the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> for fifty pence to buy a coat. But he, walking on in silence, saw on the shore a great fish, gasping as if just cast up, and having secured it with the good-natured assistance of the youths, he sold it for curing to a cook of the name of Catosus, a good <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man, telling him how he had come by it, and receiving for it three hundred pence, which he laid out in wool, that his wife might exercise her skill upon, and make into a coat for him. But, on cutting up the fish, the cook found a gold ring in its belly; and immediately, moved with compassion, and influenced, too, by religious <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, gave it up to the man, saying, <q>See how the Twenty Martyrs have clothed you.</q></p>

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Projectus was bringing the relics of the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Stephen to the waters of Tibilis, a great concourse of people came to meet him at the shrine. There a blind <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> entreated that she might be led to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who was carrying the relics. He gave her the flowers he was carrying. She took them, applied them to her eyes, and immediately saw. Those who were present were astounded, while she, with every expression of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, preceded them, pursuing her way without further need of a guide.</p>

<p>Lucillus <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Sinita, in the neighborhood of the colonial town of Hippo, was carrying in procession some relics of the same <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, which had been deposited in the castle of Sinita. A fistula under which he had long labored, and which his private physician was watching an opportunity to cut, was suddenly cured by the mere carrying of that sacred fardel, &mdash; at least, afterwards there was no trace of it in his body.</p>

<p>Eucharius, a Spanish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, residing at Calama, was for a long time a sufferer from stone. By the relics of the same <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Possidius brought him, he was cured. Afterwards the same <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, sinking under another disease, was lying dead, and already they were binding his hands. By the succor of the same <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> he was raised to life, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> cloak having been brought from the oratory and laid upon the corpse.</p>

<p>There was there an old nobleman named Martial, who had a great aversion to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, but whose daughter was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, while her husband had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> that same year. When he was ill, they besought him with tears and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but he positively refused, and dismissed them from his presence in a storm of indignation. It occurred to the son-in-law to go to the oratory of St. Stephen, and there <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him with all earnestness that God might give him a right <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so that he should not delay believing in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This he did with great groaning and tears, and the burning fervor of sincere <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; then, as he left the place, he took some of the flowers that were lying there, and, as it was already night, laid them by his father's head, who so slept. And lo! Before dawn, he cries out for some one to run for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; but he happened at that time to be with me at Hippo. So when he had heard that he was from home, he asked the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> to come. They came. To the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and amazement of all, he declared that he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. As long as he remained in life, these  words were ever on his lips: <q>Christ, receive my spirit,</q> though he was not aware that these were the last words of the most blessed Stephen when he was <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. They were his last words also, for not long after he himself also gave up the ghost.</p>

<p>There, too, by the same <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, two men, one a citizen, the other a stranger, were cured of gout; but while the citizen was absolutely cured, the stranger was only informed what he should apply when the pain returned; and when he followed this advice, the pain was at once relieved.</p>

<p>Audurus is the name of an estate, where there is a church that contains a memorial shrine of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Stephen. It happened that, as a little boy was playing in the court, the oxen drawing a wagon went out of the track and crushed him with the wheel, so that immediately he seemed at his last gasp. His mother snatched him up, and laid him at the shrine, and not only did he revive, but also appeared uninjured.</p>

<p>A religious female, who lived at Caspalium, a neighboring estate, when she was so ill as to be despaired of, had her dress brought to this shrine, but before it was brought back she had gone. However, her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> wrapped her corpse in the dress, and, her breath returning, she became quite well.</p>

<p>At Hippo a Syrian called Bassus was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> at the relics of the same <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for his daughter, who was dangerously ill. He too had brought her dress with him to the shrine. But as he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, behold, his servants ran from the house to tell him she was dead. His friends, however, intercepted them, and forbade them to tell him, lest he should bewail her in public. And when he had returned to his house, which was already ringing with the lamentations of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and had thrown on his daughter's body the dress he was carrying, she was restored to life.</p>

<p>There, too, the son of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>, one of our tax-gatherers, took ill and died. And while his body was lying lifeless, and the last <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> were being prepared, amidst the weeping and mourning of all, one of the friends who were consoling the father suggested that the body should be anointed with the oil of the same <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. It was done, and he revived.</p>

<p>Likewise Eleusinus, a man of tribunitian rank among us, laid his infant son, who had died, on the shrine of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, which is in the suburb where he lived, and, after <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which he poured out there with many tears, he took up his child alive.</p>

<p>What am I to do? I am so pressed by the promise of finishing this work, that I cannot record all the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; and doubtless several of our adherents, when they read what I have narrated, will regret that I have omitted so many which they, as well as I, certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Even now I beg these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to excuse me, and to consider how long it would take me to relate all those <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of finishing the work I have undertaken forces me to omit. For were I to be silent of all others, and to record exclusively the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of healing which were wrought in the district of Calama and of Hippo by means of this <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>&mdash; I mean the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Stephen&mdash; they would fill many volumes; and yet all even of these could not be collected, but only those of which narratives have been written for public recital. For when I saw, in our own times, frequent signs of the presence of divine powers similar to those which had been given of old, I desired that narratives might be written, judging that the multitude should not remain <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of these things. It is not yet two years since these relics were first brought to Hippo-regius, and though many of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which have been wrought by it have not, as I have the most certain means of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, been recorded, those which have been published amount to almost seventy at the hour at which I write. But at Calama, where these relics have been for a longer time, and where more of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were narrated for public information, there are incomparably more.</p>

<p>At Uzali, too, a colony near Utica, many signal <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were, to my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, wrought by the same <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, whose relics had found a place there by direction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Evodius, long before we had them at Hippo. But there the custom of publishing narratives does not obtain, or, I should say, did not obtain, for possibly it may now have been begun. For, when I was there recently, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of rank, Petronia, had been miraculously cured of a serious illness of long standing, in which all medical appliances had failed, and, with the consent of the above-named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the place, I exhorted her to publish an account of it that might be read to the people. She most promptly <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, and inserted in her narrative a circumstance which I cannot omit to mention, though I am compelled to hasten on to the subjects which this work requires me to treat. She said that she had been persuaded by a Jew to wear next her skin, under all her clothes, a hair girdle, and on this girdle a ring, which, instead of a gem, had a stone which had been found in the kidneys of an ox. Girt with this charm, she was making her way to the threshold of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. But, after leaving <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and when she had been lodging in her own  demesne on the river Bagrada, and was now rising to continue her journey, she saw her ring lying before her feet. In great surprise she examined the hair girdle, and when she found it bound, as it had been, quite firmly with knots, she conjectured that the ring had been worn through and dropped off; but when she found that the ring was itself also perfectly whole, she presumed that by this great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> she had received somehow a pledge of her cure, whereupon she untied the girdle, and cast it into the river, and the ring along with it. This is not credited by those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> either that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> came forth from His mother's womb without destroying her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and entered among His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> when the doors were shut; but let them make strict inquiry into this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, and if they find it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, let them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> those others. The lady is of distinction, nobly born, married to a nobleman. She resides at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>. The city is distinguished, the person is distinguished, so that they who make inquiries cannot fail to find satisfaction. Certainly the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> himself, by whose <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> she was healed, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on the Son of her who remained a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; on Him who came in among the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> when the doors were shut; in fine&mdash;and to this tends all that we have been retailing&mdash;on Him who ascended into heaven with the flesh in which He had risen; and it is because he laid down his life for this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that such <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were done by his means.</p>

<p>Even now, therefore, many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are wrought, the same God who wrought those we read of still performing them, by whom He will and as He will; but they are not as well known, nor are they beaten into the memory, like gravel, by frequent reading, so that they cannot fall out of mind. For even where, as is now done among ourselves, care is taken that the pamphlets of those who receive benefit be read publicly, yet those who are present hear the narrative but once, and many are absent; and so it comes to pass that even those who are present forget in a few days what they heard, and scarcely one of them can be found who will tell what he heard to one who he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> was not present.</p>

<p>One <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> was wrought among ourselves, which, though no greater than those I have mentioned, was yet so signal and conspicuous, that I suppose there is no inhabitant of Hippo who did not either see or hear of it, none who could possibly forget it. There were seven brothers and three sisters of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Cappadocian C&aelig;sarea, who were cursed by their mother, a new-made <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, on account of some wrong they had done her, and which she bitterly resented, and who were visited with so severe a punishment from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, that all of them were seized with a hideous shaking in all their limbs. Unable, while presenting this loathsome appearance, to endure the eyes of their fellow citizens, they wandered over almost the whole Roman world, each following his own direction. Two of them came to Hippo, a brother and a sister, Paulus and Palladia, already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in many other places by the fame of their wretched lot. Now it was about fifteen days before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> when they came, and they came daily to church, and specially to the relics of the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Stephen, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> that God might now be appeased, and restore their former health. There, and wherever they went, they attracted the attention of every one. Some who had seen them elsewhere, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their trembling, told others as occasion offered. <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> arrived, and on the Lord's day, in the morning, when there was now a large crowd present, and the young man was holding the bars of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place where the relics were, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, suddenly he fell down, and lay precisely as if asleep, but not trembling as he was wont to do even in sleep. All present were astonished. Some were alarmed, some were moved with pity; and while some were for lifting him up, others prevented them, and said they should rather wait and see what would result. And behold! He rose up, and trembled no more, for he was healed, and stood quite well, scanning those who were scanning him. Who then refrained himself from praising God? The whole church was filled with the voices of those who were shouting and congratulating him. Then they came running to me, where I was sitting ready to come into the church. One after another they throng in, the last comer telling me as news what the first had told me already; and while I rejoiced and inwardly gave God thanks, the young man himself also enters, with a number of others, falls at my knees, is raised up to receive my <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>. We go in to the congregation: the church was full, and ringing with the shouts of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, <q>Thanks to God! Praised be God!</q> every one joining and shouting on all sides, <q>I have healed the people,</q> and then with still louder voice shouting again. &nbsp;Silence being at last obtained, the customary lessons of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> were read. And when I came to my sermon, I made a few remarks suitable to the occasion and the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> and joyful feeling, not desiring them to listen to me, but rather to consider the eloquence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this divine work. The man dined with us, and gave us a careful ac  count of his own, his mother's, and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family's</a> calamity. Accordingly, on the following day, after delivering my sermon, I promised that next day I would read his narrative to the people.  And when I did so, the third day after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Sunday, I made the brother and sister both stand on the steps of the raised place from which I used to speak; and while they stood there their pamphlet was read.  The whole congregation, men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> alike, saw the one standing without any unnatural movement, the other trembling in all her limbs; so that those who had not before seen the man himself saw in his sister what the divine compassion had removed from him. In him they saw matter of congratulation, in her subject for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Meanwhile, their pamphlet being finished, I instructed them to withdraw from the gaze of the people; and I had begun to discuss the whole matter somewhat more carefully, when lo! As I was proceeding, other voices are heard from the tomb of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, shouting new congratulations. My audience turned round, and began to run to the tomb. The young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, when she had come down from the steps where she had been standing, went to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> at the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> relics, and no sooner had she touched the bars than she, in the same way as her brother, collapsed, as if falling asleep, and rose up cured. While, then, we were asking what had happened, and what occasioned this noise of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, they came into the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> where we were, leading her from the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> tomb in perfect health. Then, indeed, such a shout of wonder rose from men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> together, that the exclamations and the tears seemed like never to come to an end. She was led to the place where she had a little before stood trembling. They now rejoiced that she was like her brother, as before they had mourned that she remained unlike him; and as they had not yet uttered their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in her behalf, they perceived that their intention of doing so had been speedily heard. They shouted God's praises without words, but with such a noise that our ears could scarcely bear it. What was there in the hearts of these exultant people but the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for which Stephen had shed his blood?</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.&mdash; That All the Miracles Which are Done by Means of the Martyrs in the Name of Christ Testify to that Faith Which the Martyrs Had in Christ.</h2>

<p>To what do these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, but to this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which preaches Christ risen in the flesh, and ascended with the same into heaven? For the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> themselves were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, that is to say, witnesses of this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, drawing upon themselves by their testimony the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the world, and conquering the world not by resisting it, but by dying. For this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they died, and can now ask these benefits from the Lord in whose name they were slain. For this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> their marvellous constancy was exercised, so that in these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> great power was manifested as the result. For if the resurrection of the flesh to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life had not taken place in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and were not to be accomplished in His people, as predicted by Christ, or by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who foretold that Christ was to come, why do the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who were slain for this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which proclaims the resurrection possess such power? For whether God Himself wrought these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by that wonderful manner of working by which, though Himself <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, He produces effects in time; or whether He wrought them by servants, and if so, whether He made use of the spirits of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> as He uses men who are still in the body, or effects all these marvels by means of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, over whom He exerts an invisible, immutable, incorporeal sway, so that what is said to be done by the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> is done not by their operation, but only by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and request; or whether, finally, some things are done in one way, others in another, and so that man cannot at all comprehend them&mdash;nevertheless these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> attest this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which preaches the resurrection of the flesh to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.&mdash; That the Martyrs Who Obtain Many Miracles in Order that the True God May Be Worshipped, are Worthy of Much Greater Honor Than the Demons, Who Do Some Marvels that They Themselves May Be Supposed to Be God.</h2>

<p>Here perhaps our adversaries will say that their gods also have done some wonderful things, if now they begin to compare their gods to our dead men. Or will they also say that they have gods taken from among dead men, such as Hercules, Romulus, and many others whom they fancy to have been received into the number of the gods? But our <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are not our gods; for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and we have both but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that the same. Nor yet are the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which they maintain to have been done by means of their temples at all comparable to those which are done by the tombs of our <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. If they seem similar, their gods have been defeated by our <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> as  <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh's</a> <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> were by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. In reality, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> wrought these marvels with the same impure <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> with which they aspired to be the gods of the nations; but the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> do these wonders, or rather God does them while they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and assist, in order that an impulse may be given to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they are not our gods, but have, together with ourselves, one God. In fine, they built temples to these gods of theirs, and set up altars, and ordained <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and appointed <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; but to our <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> we build, not temples as if they were gods, but monuments as to dead men whose spirits live with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Neither do we erect altars at these monuments that we may <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and of ourselves; and in this <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> they are named in their own place and rank as men of God who conquered the world by confessing Him, but they are not invoked by the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. For it is to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not to them, he <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, though he <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> at their monument; for he is God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, not theirs. The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> itself, too, is the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is not offered to them, because they themselves are this body. Which then can more readily be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>? They who wish themselves to be reckoned gods by those on whom they work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, or those whose sole object in working any <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is to induce <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in Christ also as God? They who wished to turn even their crimes into sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, or those who are unwilling that even their own praises be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and seek that everything for which they are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> praised be ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him in whom they are praised? For in the Lord their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are praised. Let us therefore <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> those who both speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and work wonders. For by speaking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they suffered, and so won the power of working wonders. And the leading <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they professed is that Christ rose from the dead, and first showed in His own flesh the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the resurrection which He promised should be ours, either in the beginning of the world to come, or in the end of this world.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.&mdash; Against the Platonists, Who Argue from the Physical Weight of the Elements that an Earthly Body Cannot Inhabit Heaven.</h2>

<p>But against this great gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, these reasoners, <q>whose thoughts the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that they are vain</q>  bring arguments from the weights of the elements; for they have been taught by their master <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> that the two greatest elements of the world, and the furthest removed from one another, are coupled and united by the two intermediate, air and water. And consequently they say, since the earth is the first of the elements, beginning from the base of the series, the second the water above the earth, the third the air above the water, the fourth the heaven above the air, it follows that a body of earth cannot live in the heaven; for each element is poised by its own weight so as to preserve its own place and rank. Behold with what arguments <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity, possessed with vanity, contradicts the omnipotence of God! What, then, do so many earthly bodies do in the air, since the air is the third element from the earth? Unless perhaps He who has granted to the earthly bodies of birds that they be carried through the air by the lightness of feathers and wings, has not been able to confer upon the bodies of men made <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> the power to abide in the highest heaven. The earthly animals, too, which cannot fly, among which are men, ought on these terms to live under the earth, as fishes, which are the animals of the water, live under the water. Why, then, can an animal of earth not live in the second element, that is, in water, while it can in the third? Why, though it belongs to the earth, is it immediately suffocated if it is forced to live in the second element next above earth, while it lives in the third, and cannot live out of it? Is there a mistake here in the order of the elements, or is not the mistake rather in their reasonings, and not in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things? I will not repeat what I said in the thirteenth book,  that many earthly bodies, though heavy like lead, receive from the workman's hand a form which enables them to swim in water; and yet it is denied that the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> Worker can confer on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body a property which shall enable it to pass into heaven and dwell there.</p>

<p>But against what I have formerly said they can find nothing to say, even though they introduce and make the most of this order of the elements in which they confide. For if the order be that the earth is first, the water second, the air third, the heaven fourth, then the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is above all. For Aristotle said that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was a fifth body, while <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> denied that it was a body at all. If it were a fifth body, then certainly it would be above the rest; and if it is not a body at all, so much the more does it rise above all. What, then, does it do in an earthly body? What does this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is finer than all else, do  in such a mass of matter as this? What does the lightest of substances do in this ponderosity? This swiftest substance in such sluggishness? Will not the body be raised to heaven by virtue of so excellent a nature as this? And if now earthly bodies can retain the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> below, shall not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> be one day able to raise the earthly bodies above?</p>

<p>If we pass now to their <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which they oppose to our <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> as wrought by their gods, shall not even these be found to make for us, and help out our argument? For if any of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of their gods are great, certainly that is a great one which Varro mentions of a vestal virgin, who, when she was endangered by a false accusation of unchastity, filled a sieve with water from the Tiber, and carried it to her judges without any part of it leaking. Who kept the weight of water in the sieve? Who prevented any drop from falling from it through so many open holes? They will answer, Some god or some <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>. If a god, is he greater than the God who made the world? If a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, is he mightier than an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who serves the God by whom the world was made? If, then, a lesser god, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> could so sustain the weight of this liquid element that the water might seem to have changed its nature, shall not Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who Himself created all the elements, be able to eliminate from the earthly body its heaviness, so that the quickened body shall dwell in whatever element the quickening spirit pleases?</p>

<p>Then, again, since they give the air a middle place between the fire above and the water beneath, how is it that we often find it between water and water, and between the water and the earth? For what do they make of those watery clouds, between which and the seas air is constantly found intervening? I should like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by what weight and order of the elements it comes to pass that very violent and stormy torrents are suspended in the clouds above the earth before they rush along upon the earth under the air. In fine, why is it that throughout the whole globe the air is between the highest heaven and the earth, if its place is between the sky and the water, as the place of the water is between the sky and the earth?</p>

<p>Finally, if the order of the elements is so disposed that, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> thinks, the two extremes, fire and earth, are united by the two means, air and water, and that the fire occupies the highest part of the sky, and the earth the lowest part, or as it were the foundation of the world, and that therefore earth cannot be in the heavens, how is fire in the earth? For, according to this reasoning, these two elements, earth and fire, ought to be so restricted to their own places, the highest and the lowest, that neither the lowest can rise to the place of the highest, nor the highest sink to that of the lowest. Thus, as they think that no particle of earth is or shall ever be in the sky so we ought to see no particle of fire on the earth. But the fact is that it exists to such an extent, not only on but even under the earth, that the tops of mountains vomit it forth; besides that we see it to exist on earth for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> uses, and even to be produced from the earth, since it is kindled from wood and stones, which are without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> earthly bodies. But that [upper] fire, they say, is tranquil, pure, harmless, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; but this [earthly] fire is turbid, smoky, corruptible, and corrupting. But it does not corrupt the mountains and caverns of the earth in which it rages continually. But grant that the earthly fire is so unlike the other as to suit its earthly position, why then do they object to our believing that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of earthly bodies shall some day be made incorruptible and fit for the sky, even as now fire is corruptible and suited to the earth? They therefore adduce from their weights and order of the elements nothing from which they can prove that it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> to make our bodies such that they can dwell in the skies.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.&mdash; Against the Calumnies with Which Unbelievers Throw Ridicule Upon the Christian Faith in the Resurrection of the Flesh.</h2>

<p>But their way is to feign a scrupulous anxiety in investigating this question, and to cast ridicule on our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the resurrection of the body, by asking, Whether abortions shall rise? And as the Lord says, <q>Verily I say unto you, not a hair of your head shall perish,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121628"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;21:18</a></span> shall all bodies have an equal stature and strength, or shall there be differences in size? For if there is to be equality, where shall those abortions, supposing that they rise again, get that bulk which they had not here? Or if they shall not rise because they were not born but cast out, they raise the same question about children who have died in childhood, asking us whence they get the stature which we see they had not here; for we will not say that those who have been not only born, but born again, shall not rise again. Then, further, they ask of what size these equal bodies shall be. For if all shall be as tall and large as were the tallest and largest in this world, they ask us how it is that not only children but many full-grown <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>  shall receive what they here did not possess, if each one is to receive what he had here. And if the saying of the apostle, that we are all to come to the <q>measure of the age of the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121629"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> or that other saying, <q>Whom He <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> to be conformed to the image of His Son,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121630"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;8:29</a></span> is to be understood to mean that the stature and size of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body shall be the measure of the bodies of all those who shall be in His kingdom, then, say they, the size and height of many must be diminished; and if so much of the bodily frame itself be lost, what becomes of the saying, <q>Not a hair of your head shall perish?</q> Besides, it might be asked regarding the hair itself, whether all that the barber has cut off shall be restored? And if it is to be restored, who would not shrink from such deformity? For as the same restoration will be made of what has been pared off the nails, much will be replaced on the body which a regard for its appearance had cut off. And where, then, will be its beauty, which assuredly ought to be much greater in that <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> condition than it could be in this corruptible state? On the other hand, if such things are not restored to the body, they must perish; how, then, they say, shall not a hair of the head perish? In like manner they reason about fatness and leanness; for if all are to be equal, then certainly there shall not be some fat, others lean. Some, therefore, shall gain, others lose something. Consequently there will not be a simple restoration of what formerly <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, but, on the one hand, an addition of what had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and, on the other, a loss of what did before exist.</p>

<p>The difficulties, too, about the corruption and dissolution of dead bodies&mdash;that one is turned into dust, while another evaporates into the air; that some are devoured by beasts, some by fire, while some perish by shipwreck or by drowning in one shape or other, so that their bodies decay into liquid, these difficulties give them immoderate alarm, and they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that all those dissolved elements cannot be gathered again and reconstructed into a body. They also make eager use of all the deformities and blemishes which either accident or birth has produced, and accordingly, with horror and derision, cite monstrous births, and ask if every deformity will be preserved in the resurrection. For if we say that no such thing shall be reproduced in the body of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, they suppose that they confute us by citing the marks of the wounds which we assert were found in the risen body of the Lord Christ. But of all these, the most difficult question is, into whose body that flesh shall return which has been eaten and assimilated by another man constrained by hunger to use it so; for it has been converted into the flesh of the man who used it as his nutriment, and it filled up those losses of flesh which famine had produced. For the sake, then, of ridiculing the resurrection, they ask, Shall this return to the man whose flesh it first was, or to him whose flesh it afterwards became? And thus, too, they seek to give promise to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of alternations of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> misery and false <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, in accordance with <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> theory; or, in accordance with Porphyry's, that, after many transmigrations into different bodies, it ends its miseries, and never more returns to them, not, however, by obtaining an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> body, but by escaping from every kind of body.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; Whether Abortions, If They are Numbered Among the Dead, Shall Not Also Have a Part in the Resurrection.</h2>

<p>To these objections, then, of our adversaries which I have thus detailed, I will now reply, trusting that God will mercifully assist my endeavors. That abortions, which, even supposing they were alive in the womb, did also die there, shall rise again, I make bold neither to affirm nor to deny, although I fail to see why, if they are not excluded from the number of the dead, they should not attain to the resurrection of the dead. For either all the dead shall not rise, and there will be to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> some <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> without bodies though they once had them&mdash;only in their mother's womb, indeed; or, if all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> shall receive again the bodies which they had wherever they lived, and which they left when they died, then I do not see how I can say that even those who died in their mother's womb shall have no resurrection. But whichever of these opinions any one may adopt concerning them, we must at least apply to them, if they rise again, all that we have to say of infants who have been born.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.&mdash; Whether Infants Shall Rise in that Body Which They Would Have Had Had They Grown Up.</h2>

<p>What, then, are we to say of infants, if not that they will not rise in that diminutive body in which they died, but shall receive by the marvellous and rapid operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that body which time by a slower process would have given them? For in the Lord's words, where He says, <q>Not a hair of your head  shall perish,</q>  it is asserted that nothing which was possessed shall be wanting; but it is not said that nothing which was not possessed shall be given. To the dead infant there was wanting the perfect stature of its body; for even the perfect infant lacks the perfection of bodily size, being capable of further growth. This perfect stature is, in a sense, so possessed by all that they are conceived and born with it&mdash;that is, they have it potentially, though not yet in actual bulk; just as all the members of the body are potentially in the seed, though, even after the child is born, some of them, the teeth for example, may be wanting. In this seminal principle of every substance, there seems to be, as it were, the beginning of everything which does not yet exist, or rather does not appear, but which in process of time will come into being, or rather into sight. In this, therefore, the child who is to be tall or short is already tall or short. And in the resurrection of the body, we need, for the same reason, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> no bodily loss; for though all should be of equal size, and reach gigantic proportions, lest the men who were largest here should lose anything of their bulk and it should perish, in contradiction to the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who said that not a hair of their head should perish, yet why should there lack the means by which that wonderful Worker should make such additions, seeing that He is the Creator, who Himself created all things out of nothing?</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; Whether the Bodies of All the Dead Shall Rise the Same Size as the Lord's Body.</h2>

<p>It is certain that Christ rose in the same bodily stature in which He died, and that it is wrong to say that, when the general resurrection shall have arrived, His body shall, for the sake of equalling the tallest, assume proportions which it had not when He appeared to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in the figure with which they were familiar. But if we say that even the bodies of taller men are to be reduced to the size of the Lord's body, there will be a great loss in many bodies, though He promised that, not a hair of their head should perish. It remains, therefore, that we conclude that every man shall receive his own size which he had in youth, though he died an old man, or which he would have had, supposing he died before his prime. As for what the apostle said of the measure of the age of the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we must either understand him to refer to something else, viz., to the fact that the measure of Christ will be completed when all the members among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities are added to the Head; or if we are to refer it to the resurrection of the body, the meaning is that all shall rise neither beyond nor under youth, but in that vigor and age to which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Christ had arrived. For even the world's wisest men have fixed the bloom of youth at about the age of thirty; and when this period has been passed, the man begins to decline towards the defective and duller period of old age. And therefore the apostle did not speak of the measure of the body, nor of the measure of the stature, but of <q>the measure of the age of the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 16.&mdash; What is Meant by the Conforming of the Saints to the Image of The Son of God.</h2>

<p>Then, again, these words, <q><a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">Predestinate</a> to be conformed to the image of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121632"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;8:29</a></span> may be understood of the inner man. So in another place He says to us, <q>Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed in the renewing of your mind.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121633"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;12:2</a></span> In so far, then, as we are transformed so as not to be conformed to the world, we are conformed to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. It may also be understood thus, that as He was conformed to us by assuming mortality, we shall be conformed to Him by <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; and this indeed is connected with the resurrection of the body. But if we are also taught in these words what form our bodies shall rise in, as the measure we spoke of before, so also this conformity is to be understood not of size, but of age. Accordingly all shall rise in the stature they either had attained or would have attained had they lived to their prime, although it will be no great disadvantage even if the form of the body be infantine or aged, while no infirmity shall remain in the mind nor in the body itself. So that even if any one contends that every person will rise again in the same bodily form in which he died, we need not spend much labor in disputing with him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.&mdash; Whether the Bodies of Women Shall Retain Their Own Sex in the Resurrection.</h2>

<p>From the words, <q>Till we all come to a perfect man, to the measure of the age of the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121634"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> and from the words, <q>Conformed to the image of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121635"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;8:29</a></span> some conclude that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> shall not rise <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, but that all shall be men, because  God made man only of earth, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of the man. For my part, they seem to be wiser who make no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that both sexes shall rise. For there shall be no <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, which is now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of confusion. For before they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, the man and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> were naked, and were not ashamed. From those bodies, then, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> shall be withdrawn, while nature shall be preserved. And the sex of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but nature. It shall then indeed be superior to carnal intercourse and child-bearing; nevertheless the female members shall remain adapted not to the old uses, but to a new beauty, which, so far from provoking <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, now extinct, shall excite praise to the wisdom and clemency of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who both made what was not and delivered from corruption what He made. For at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was made of a rib taken from the side of the man while he slept; for it seemed fit that even then Christ and His Church should be foreshadowed in this event. For that sleep of the man was the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whose side, as He hung lifeless upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, was pierced with a spear, and there flowed from it blood and water, and these we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> by which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is <q>built up.</q> For Scripture used this very word, not saying <q>He formed</q> or <q>framed,</q> but <q>built her up into a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121636"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse22">Genesis&nbsp;2:22</a></span> whence also the apostle speaks of the <em>edification</em> of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note121637"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse12">Ephesians&nbsp;4:12</a></span> which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, therefore, is a creature of God even as the man; but by her creation from man unity is commended; and the manner of her creation prefigured, as has been said, Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He, then, who created both sexes will restore both. Jesus Himself also, when asked by the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, who denied the resurrection, which of the seven brothers should have to wife the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom all in succession had taken to raise up seed to their brother, as the law enjoined, says, <q>You do <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> nor the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121638"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;22:29</a></span> And though it was a fit opportunity for His saying, She about whom you make inquiries shall herself be a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, He said nothing of the kind; but <q>In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121639"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;22:30</a></span> They shall be equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, not in flesh, nor in resurrection, which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> did not need, because they could not die. The Lord then denied that there would be in the resurrection, not <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, but marriages; and He uttered this denial in circumstances in which the question mooted would have been more easily and speedily solved by denying that the female sex would exist, if this had in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> been foreknown by Him. But, indeed, He even affirmed that the sex should exist by saying, <q>They shall not be given in marriage,</q> which can only apply to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>; <q>Neither shall they marry,</q> which applies to males. There shall therefore be those who are in this world accustomed to marry and be given in marriage, only they shall there make no such marriages.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.&mdash; Of the Perfect Man, that Is, Christ; And of His Body, that Is, The Church, Which is His Fullness.</h2>

<p>To understand what the apostle means when he says that we shall all come to a perfect man, we must consider the connection of the whole passage, which runs thus: <q>He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that He might fill all things. And He gave some, <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; and some, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and some, <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, to a perfect man, to the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ: that we henceforth be no more children, tossed and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but, speaking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, may grow up in Him in all things, which is the Head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body, unto the edifying of itself in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121640"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse10">Ephesians&nbsp;4:10-16</a></span> Behold what the perfect man is&mdash; the head and the body, which is made up of all the members, which in their own time shall be perfected. But new additions are daily being made to this body while the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is being built up, to which it is said, <q>You are the body of Christ and His members;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121641"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:27</a></span> and again, <q>For His body's sake,</q> he says, <q>which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121642"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse24">Colossians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> and again, <q>We being many are one head, one body.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121643"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:17</a></span> It is of the edification of this body that it is here, too, said, <q>For the perfecting of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, for the work of the ministry, for the edification of the body of Christ;</q> and then that passage of which we are now speaking is  added, <q>Till we all come to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, to a perfect man, to the measure of the age of the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> and so on. And he shows of what body we are to understand this to be the measure, when he says, <q>That we may grow up into Him in all things, which is the Head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part.</q> As, therefore, there is a measure of every part, so there is a measure of the fullness of the whole body which is made up of all its parts, and it is of this measure it is said, <q>To the measure of the age of the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> This fullness he spoke of also in the place where he says of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>And gave Him to be the Head over all things to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,  which is His body, the fullness of Him that fills all in all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121645"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse22">Ephesians&nbsp;1:22-23</a></span> But even if this should be referred to the form in which each one shall rise, what should hinder us from applying to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> what is expressly said of the man, understanding both sexes to be included under the general term <q>man?</q> For certainly in the saying, <q>Blessed is he who fears the Lord,</q>  <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord are included.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.&mdash; That All Bodily Blemishes Which Mar Human Beauty in This Life Shall Be Removed in the Resurrection, the Natural Substance of the Body Remaining, But the Quality and Quantity of It Being Altered So as to Produce Beauty.</h2>

<p>What am I to say now about the hair and nails? Once it is understood that no part of the body shall so perish as to produce deformity in the body, it is at the same time understood that such things as would have produced a deformity by their excessive proportions shall be added to the total bulk of the body, not to parts in which the beauty of the proportion would thus be marred. Just as if, after making a vessel of clay, one wished to make it over again of the same clay, it would not be necessary that the same portion of the clay which had formed the handle should again form the new handle, or that what had formed the bottom should again do so, but only that the whole clay should go to make up the whole new vessel, and that no part of it should be left unused. Wherefore, if the hair that has been cropped and the nails that have been cut would <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a deformity were they to be restored to their places, they shall not be restored; and yet no one will lose these parts at the resurrection, for they shall be changed into the same flesh, their substance being so altered as to preserve the proportion of the various parts of the body. However, what our Lord said, <q>Not a hair of your head shall perish,</q> might more suitably be interpreted of the number, and not of the length of the hairs, as He elsewhere says, <q>The hairs of your head are all numbered.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121647"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;12:7</a></span> Nor would I say this because I suppose that any part naturally belonging to the body can perish, but that whatever deformity was in it, and served to exhibit the penal condition in which we mortals are, should be restored in such a way that, while the substance is entirely preserved, the deformity shall perish. For if even a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> workman, who has, for some reason, made a deformed <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, can recast it and make it very beautiful, and this without suffering any part of the substance, but only the deformity to be lost&mdash;if he can, for example, remove some unbecoming or disproportionate part, not by cutting off and separating this part from the whole, but by so breaking down and mixing up the whole as to get rid of the blemish without diminishing the quantity of his material&mdash;shall we not think as highly of the almighty Worker? Shall He not be able to remove and abolish all deformities of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, whether common ones or rare and monstrous, which, though in keeping with this miserable life, are yet not to be thought of in connection with that future blessedness; and shall He not be able so to remove them that, while the natural but unseemly blemishes are put an end to, the natural substance shall suffer no diminution?</p>

<p>And consequently overgrown and emaciated <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> need not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that they shall be in heaven of such a figure as they would not be even in this world if they could help it. For all bodily beauty consists in the proportion of the parts, together with a certain agreeableness of color. Where there is no proportion, the eye is offended, either because there is something awanting, or too small, or too large. And thus there shall be no deformity resulting from want of proportion in that state in which all that is wrong is corrected, and all that is defective supplied from resources the Creator knows of, and all that is excessive removed without destroying the integrity of the substance. And as for the pleasant color, how conspicuous shall it be where <q>the just shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121648"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse43">Matthew&nbsp;13:43</a></span> This brightness we must rather  <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to have been concealed from the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> when Christ rose, than to have been awanting. For weak <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> eyesight could not bear it, and it was necessary that they should so look upon Him as to be able to recognize Him. For this purpose also He allowed them to touch the marks of His wounds, and also ate and drank&mdash;not because He needed nourishment, but because He could take it if He wished. Now, when an object, though present, is invisible to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who see other things which are present, as we say that that brightness was present but invisible by those who saw other things, this is called in Greek <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>; and our Latin translators, for want of a better word, have rendered this <em> c&aelig;citas</em> (blindness) in the book of Genesis. This blindness the men of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> suffered when they sought the just <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> gate and could not find it. But if it had been blindness, that is to say, if they could see nothing, then they would not have asked for the gate by which they might enter the house, but for guides who might lead them away.</p>

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> we bear to the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> causes us, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how, to desire to see in the heavenly kingdom the marks of the wounds which they received for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and possibly we shall see them. For this will not be a deformity, but a mark of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and will add lustre to their appearance, and a spiritual, if not a bodily beauty. And yet we need not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they to whom it has been said, <q>Not a hair of your head shall perish,</q> shall, in the resurrection, want such of their members as they have been deprived of in their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. But if it will be seemly in that new kingdom to have some marks of these wounds still visible in that <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> flesh, the places where they have been wounded or mutilated shall retain the scars without any of the members being lost. While, therefore, it is quite <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that no blemishes which the body has sustained shall appear in the resurrection, yet we are not to reckon or name these marks of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> blemishes.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.&mdash; That, in the Resurrection, the Substance of Our Bodies, However Disintegrated, Shall Be Entirely Reunited.</h2>

<p>Far be it from us to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that the omnipotence of the Creator cannot, for the resuscitation and reanimation of our bodies, recall all the portions which have been consumed by beasts or fire, or have been dissolved into dust or ashes, or have decomposed into water, or evaporated into the air. Far from us be the thought, that anything which escapes our observation in any most hidden recess of nature either evades the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or transcends the power of the Creator of all things. Cicero, the great authority of our adversaries, wishing to define God as accurately as possible, says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> free and independent, without materiality, perceiving and moving all things, and itself endowed with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> movement.</q>  This he found in the systems of the greatest <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. Let me ask, then, in their own language, how anything can either lie hidden from Him who perceives all things, or irrevocably escape Him who moves all things?</p>

<p>This leads me to reply to that question which seems the most difficult of all&mdash;To whom, in the resurrection, will belong the flesh of a dead man which has become the flesh of a living man? For if some one, famishing for want and pressed with hunger, use <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh as food&mdash;an extremity not unknown, as both ancient history and the unhappy experience of our own days have taught us&mdash;can it be contended, with any show of reason, that all the flesh eaten has been evacuated, and that none of it has been assimilated to the substance of the eater though the very emaciation which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before, and has now disappeared, sufficiently indicates what large deficiencies have been filled up with this food? But I have already made some remarks which will suffice for the solution of this difficulty also. For all the flesh which hunger has consumed finds its way into the air by evaporation, whence, as we have said, God Almighty can recall it. That flesh, therefore, shall be restored to the man in whom it first became <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh. For it must be looked upon as borrowed by the other person, and, like a pecuniary loan, must be returned to the lender. His own flesh, however, which he lost by famine, shall be restored to him by Him who can recover even what has evaporated. And though it had been absolutely annihilated, so that no part of its substance remained in any secret spot of nature, the Almighty could restore it by such means as He saw fit. For this sentence, uttered by the Truth, <q>Not a hair of your head shall perish,</q> forbids us to suppose that, though no hair of a man's head can perish, yet the large portions of his flesh eaten and consumed by the famishing can perish.</p>

<p>From all that we have thus considered, and discussed with such poor ability as we can command, we gather this conclusion, that in  the resurrection of the flesh the body shall be of that size which it either had attained or should have attained in the flower of its youth, and shall enjoy the beauty that arises from preserving symmetry and proportion in all its members. And it is reasonable to suppose that, for the preservation of this beauty, any part of the body's substance, which, if placed in one spot, would produce a deformity, shall be distributed through the whole of it, so that neither any part, nor the symmetry of the whole, may be lost, but only the general stature of the body somewhat increased by the distribution in all the parts of that which, in one place, would have been unsightly. Or if it is contended that each will rise with the same stature as that of the body he died in, we shall not obstinately dispute this, provided only there be no deformity, no infirmity, no languor, no corruption&mdash;nothing of any kind which would ill become that kingdom in which the children of the resurrection and of the promise shall be equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if not in body and age, at least in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.&mdash; Of the New Spiritual Body into Which the Flesh of the Saints Shall Be Transformed.</h2>

<p>Whatever, therefore, has been taken from the body, either during life or after death shall be restored to it, and, in conjunction with what has remained in the grave, shall rise again, transformed from the oldness of the animal body into the newness of the spiritual body, and clothed in incorruption and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. But even though the body has been all quite ground to powder by some severe accident, or by the ruthlessness of enemies, and though it has been so diligently scattered to the winds, or into the water, that there is no trace of it left, yet it shall not be beyond the omnipotence of the Creator,&mdash; no, not a hair of its head shall perish. The flesh shall then be spiritual, and subject to the spirit, but still flesh, not spirit, as the spirit itself, when subject to the flesh, was fleshly, but still spirit and not flesh. And of this we have experimental <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> in the deformity of our penal condition. For those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were carnal, not in a fleshly, but in a spiritual way, to whom the apostle said, <q>I could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121650"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:1</a></span> And a man is in this life spiritual in such a way, that he is yet carnal with respect to his body, and sees another law in his members warring against the law of his mind; but even in his body he will be spiritual when the same flesh shall have had that resurrection of which these words speak, <q>It is sown an animal body, it shall rise a spiritual body.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121651"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse44">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:44</a></span> But what this spiritual body shall be and how great its <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> it were but rash to pronounce, seeing that we have as yet no experience of it. Nevertheless, since it is fit that the joyfulness of our hope should utter itself, and so show forth God's praise, and since it was from the profoundest sentiment of ardent and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that the Psalmist cried, <q>O Lord, I have loved the beauty of Your house,</q>  we may, with God's help, speak of the gifts He lavishes on men, good and bad alike, in this most wretched life, and may do our best to conjecture the great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of that state which we cannot worthily speak of, because we have not yet experienced it. For I say nothing of the time when God made man upright; I say nothing of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life of <q>the man and his wife</q> in the fruitful garden, since it was so short that none of their children experienced it: I speak only of this life which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and in which we now are, from the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of which we cannot escape so long as we are in it, no matter what progress we make, for it is all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, and I ask, Who can describe the tokens of God's goodness that are extended to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> even in this life?</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.&mdash; Of the Miseries and Ills to Which the Human Race is Justly Exposed Through the First Sin, and from Which None Can Be Delivered Save by Christ's Grace.</h2>

<p>That the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> has been condemned in its first origin, this life itself, if life it is to be called, bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> by the host of cruel ills with which it is filled. Is not this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the profound and dreadful <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which produces all the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> that enfold the children of Adam, and from which no man can be delivered without toil, pain, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? Is it not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of so many vain and hurtful things, which produces gnawing cares, disquiet, griefs, fears, wild joys, quarrels, lawsuits, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, treasons, angers, hatreds, deceit, flattery, fraud, theft, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>, perfidy, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, ambition, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, murders, parricides, cruelty, ferocity, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, luxury, insolence, impudence, shamelessness, fornications, adulteries, incests, and the numberless uncleannesses and unnatural acts of both sexes, which it is shameful so much as to mention; sacrileges, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjuries</a>, oppression of the innocent, <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>, plots, falsehoods, false witnessings, unrighteous judgments, violent <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, plunderings, and whatever similar <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> has found its way  into the lives of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, though it cannot find its way into the conception of pure minds? These are indeed the crimes of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, yet they spring from that root of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and misplaced <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is born with every son of Adam. For who is there that has not observed with what profound <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, manifesting itself even in infancy, and with what superfluity of foolish desires, beginning to appear in boyhood, man comes into this life, so that, were he left to live as he pleased, and to do whatever he pleased, he would plunge into all, or certainly into many of those crimes and iniquities which I mentioned, and could not mention?</p>

<p>But because God does not wholly desert those whom He condemns, nor shuts up in His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> His tender mercies, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is restrained by law and instruction, which keep guard against the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that besets us, and oppose the assaults of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but are themselves full of labor and sorrow. For what mean those multifarious threats which are used to restrain the folly of children? What mean pedagogues, masters, the birch, the strap, the cane, the schooling which <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says must be given a child, <q>beating him on the sides lest he wax stubborn,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121653"><a href="../bible/sir030.htm#verse12">Sirach&nbsp;30:12</a></span> and it be hardly possible or not possible at all to subdue him? Why all these punishments, save to overcome <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and bridle <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires&mdash; these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> with which we come into the world? For why is it that we remember with difficulty, and without difficulty forget? Learn with difficulty, and without difficulty remain <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>? Are diligent with difficulty, and without difficulty are indolent? Does not this show what vitiated nature inclines and tends to by its own weight, and what succor it needs if it is to be delivered? Inactivity, sloth, laziness, negligence, are <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> which shun labor, since labor, though useful, is itself a punishment.</p>

<p>But, besides the punishments of childhood, without which there would be no learning of what the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> wish&mdash;and the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> rarely wish anything useful to be taught&mdash;who can describe, who can conceive the number and severity of the punishments which afflict the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>&mdash;pains which are not only the accompaniment of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of godless men, but are a part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> condition and the common misery&mdash;what <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and what grief are caused by bereavement and mourning, by losses and condemnations, by fraud and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, by false suspicions, and all the crimes and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of other men? For at their hands we suffer <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>, captivity, chains, imprisonment, exile, torture, mutilation, loss of sight, the violation of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> to satisfy the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the oppressor, and many other dreadful <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. What numberless casualties threaten our bodies from without&mdash;extremes of heat and cold, storms, floods, inundations, lightning, thunder, hail, earthquakes, houses falling; or from the stumbling, or shying, or <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of horses; from countless poisons in fruits, water, air, animals; from the painful or even deadly bites of wild animals; from the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> which a mad dog communicates, so that even the animal which of all others is most gentle and friendly to its own master, becomes an object of intenser <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> than a lion or dragon, and the man whom it has by chance infected with this pestilential contagion becomes so rabid, that his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, wife, children, dread him more than any wild beast! What disasters are suffered by those who travel by land or sea! What man can go out of his own house without being exposed on all hands to unforeseen accidents? Returning home sound in limb, he slips on his own doorstep, breaks his leg, and never recovers. What can seem safer than a man sitting in his chair? Eli the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> fell from his, and broke his neck. How many accidents do farmers, or rather all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that the crops may suffer from the weather, or the soil, or the ravages of destructive animals? Commonly they feel safe when the crops are gathered and housed. Yet, to my certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, sudden floods have driven the laborers away, and swept the barns clean of the finest harvest. Is innocence a sufficient protection against the various assaults of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>? That no man might think so, even <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> infants, who are certainly unsurpassed in innocence, are sometimes so tormented, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who permits it, teaches us hereby to bewail the calamities of this life, and to desire the felicity of the life to come. As to bodily diseases, they are so numerous that they cannot all be contained even in medical books. And in very many, or almost all of them, the cures and remedies are themselves tortures, so that men are delivered from a pain that destroys by a cure that pains. Has not the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of thirst driven men to drink <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> urine, and even their own? Has not hunger driven men to eat <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, and that the flesh not of bodies found dead, but of bodies slain for the purpose? Have not the fierce pangs of famine driven mothers to eat their own children, incredibly savage as it seems? In fine, sleep itself, which is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> called repose, how little of repose there sometimes is in it when disturbed with dreams and visions; and with what terror is the wretched mind  overwhelmed by the appearances of things which are so presented, and which, as it were so stand out before the senses, that we can not distinguish them from realities! How wretchedly do false appearances distract men in certain diseases! With what astonishing variety of appearances are even healthy men sometimes deceived by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, who produce these delusions for the sake of perplexing the senses of their victims, if they cannot succeed in seducing them to their side!</p>

<p>From this <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> upon earth there is no escape, save through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Saviour Christ, our God and Lord. The very name Jesus shows this, for it means Saviour; and He saves us especially from passing out of this life into a more wretched and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> state, which is rather a death than a life. For in this life, though <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> pursuits afford us great consolations, yet the blessings which men crave are not invariably bestowed upon them, lest religion should be cultivated for the sake of these temporal advantages, while it ought rather to be cultivated for the sake of that other life from which all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is excluded. Therefore, also, does <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> aid good men in the midst of present calamities, so that they are enabled to endure them with a constancy proportioned to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The world's sages affirm that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> contributes something to this&mdash;that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which, according to Cicero, the gods have bestowed in its purity only on a few men. They have never given, he says, nor can ever give, a greater gift to men. So that even those against whom we are disputing have been compelled to acknowledge, in some fashion, that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is necessary for the acquisition, not, indeed, of any <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. And if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>&mdash; this sole support against the miseries of this life&mdash; has been given by <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> only to a few, it sufficiently appears from this that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> has been condemned to pay this penalty of wretchedness. And as, according to their acknowledgment, no greater gift has been bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so it must be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that it could be given only by that God whom they themselves recognize as greater than all the gods they worship.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.&mdash; Of the Miseries of This Life Which Attach Peculiarly to the Toil of Good Men, Irrespective of Those Which are Common to the Good and Bad.</h2>

<p>But, irrespective of the miseries which in this life are common to the good and bad, the righteous undergo labors peculiar to themselves, in so far as they make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon their <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and are involved in the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> and perils of such a contest. For though sometimes more violent and at other times slacker, yet without intermission does the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh, so that we cannot do the things we would, <span class="stiki" id="note121654"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> and extirpate all <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, but can only refuse consent to it, as God gives us ability, and so keep it under, vigilantly keeping watch lest a semblance of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> deceive us, lest a subtle discourse blind us, lest <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> involve us in darkness, lest we should take good for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for good, lest <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> should hinder us from doing what we ought, or desire precipitate us into doing what we ought not, lest the sun go down upon our <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, lest <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> provoke us to render <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, lest unseemly or immoderate grief consume us, lest an ungrateful disposition make us slow to recognize benefits received, lest <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> fret our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, lest rash suspicion on our part deceive us regarding a friend, or false suspicion of us on the part of others give us too much uneasiness, lest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> reign in our mortal body to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> its desires, lest our members be used as the instruments of unrighteousness, lest the eye follow <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, lest thirst for revenge carry us away, lest sight or thought dwell too long on some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing which gives us pleasure, lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> or indecent language be willingly listened to, lest we do what is pleasant but unlawful, and lest in this warfare, filled so abundantly with toil and peril, we either hope to secure victory by our own strength, or attribute it when secured to our own strength, and not to His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of whom the apostle says, <q>Thanks be unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gives us the victory through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121655"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse57">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:57</a></span> and in another place he says, <q>In all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121656"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse37">Romans&nbsp;8:37</a></span> But yet we are to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, that however valorously we resist our <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and however successful we are in overcoming them, yet as long as we are in this body we have always reason to say to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Forgive us our debts. <span class="stiki" id="note121657"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> But in that kingdom where we shall dwell for ever, clothed in <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> bodies, we shall no longer have either conflicts or debts,&mdash; as indeed we should not have had at any time or in any condition, had our nature continued upright as it was created. Consequently even this our conflict, in which we are exposed to peril, and from which we hope to be delivered by a final victory, belongs to the ills of this life, which is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of so many grave <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to be a life under condemnation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.&mdash; Of the Blessings with Which the Creator Has Filled This Life, Obnoxious Though It Be to the Curse.</h2>

<p>But we must now contemplate the rich and countless blessings with which the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who cares for all He has created, has filled this very misery of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, which reflects His retributive <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. That first blessing which He pronounced before the fall, when He said, <q>Increase, and multiply, and replenish the earth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121658"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> He did not inhibit after man had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, but the fecundity originally bestowed remained in the condemned stock; and the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which has involved us in the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of dying, has yet not deprived us of that wonderful power of seed, or rather of that still more marvellous power by which seed is produced, and which seems to be as it were inwrought and inwoven in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body. But in this river, as I may call it, or torrent of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, both elements are carried along together&mdash;both the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is derived from him who begets, and the good which is bestowed by Him who creates us. In the original <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> there are two things, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and punishment; in the original good, there are two other things, propagation and conformation. But of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, of which the one, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, arose from our audacity, and the other, punishment, from God's judgment, we have already said as much as suits our present purpose. I mean now to speak of the blessings which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has conferred or still confers upon our nature, vitiated and condemned as it is. For in condemning it He did not withdraw all that He had given it, else it had been annihilated; neither did He, in penally subjecting it to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, remove it beyond His own power; for not even the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself is outside of God's government, since the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> nature subsists only by the supreme Creator who gives being to all that in any form exists.</p>

<p>Of these two blessings, then, which we have said flow from God's goodness, as from a fountain, towards our nature, vitiated by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and condemned to punishment, the one, propagation, was conferred by God's benediction when He made those first works, from which He rested on the seventh day. But the other, conformation, is conferred in that work of His wherein <q>He works hitherto.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121659"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;5:17</a></span> For were He to withdraw His efficacious power from things, they should neither be able to go on and complete the periods assigned to their measured movements, nor should they even continue in possession of that nature they were created in. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, so created man that He gave him what we may call fertility, whereby he might propagate other men, giving them a congenital capacity to propagate their kind, but not imposing on them any necessity to do so. This capacity God withdraws at pleasure from individuals, making them barren; but from the whole race He has not withdrawn the blessing of propagation once conferred. But though not withdrawn on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this power of propagation is not what it would have been had there been no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For since <q>man placed in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> fell, he has become like the beasts,</q>  and generates as they do, though the little spark of reason, which was the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in him, has not been quite quenched. But if conformation were not added to propagation, there would be no reproduction of one's kind. For even though there were no such thing as copulation, and God wished to fill the earth with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> inhabitants, He might create all these as He created one without the help of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generation. And, indeed, even as it is, those who copulate can generate nothing save by the creative energy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As, therefore, in respect of that spiritual growth whereby a man is formed to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and righteousness, the apostle says, <q>Neither is he that plants anything, neither he that waters, but God that gives the increase,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121661"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:7</a></span> so also it must be said that it is not he that generates that is anything, but God that gives the essential form; that it is not the mother who carries and nurses the fruit of her womb that is anything, but God that gives the increase. For He alone, by that energy wherewith <q>He works hitherto,</q> causes the seed to develop, and to evolve from certain secret and invisible folds into the visible forms of beauty which we see. He alone, coupling and connecting in some wonderful fashion the spiritual and corporeal natures, the one to command, the other to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, makes a living being. And this work of His is so great and wonderful, that not only man, who is a rational animal, and consequently more excellent than all other animals of the earth, but even the most diminutive insect, cannot be considered attentively without astonishment and without praising the Creator.</p>

<p>It is He, then, who has given to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, in which reason and understanding lie as it were asleep during infancy, and as if they were not, destined, however, to be awakened and exercised as years increase, so as to become capable of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and of receiving instruction, fit to understand what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. It is by this capacity the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> drinks in wisdom, and  becomes endowed with those <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> by which, in <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, and righteousness, it makes <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and the other inborn <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and conquers them by fixing its desires upon no other object than the supreme and unchangeable Good. And even though this be not uniformly the result, yet who can competently utter or even conceive the grandeur of this work of the Almighty, and the unspeakable boon He has conferred upon our rational nature, by giving us even the capacity of such attainment? For over and above those arts which are called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and which teach us how we may spend our life well, and attain to endless <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>&mdash;arts which are given to the children of the promise and the kingdom by the sole <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>&mdash;has not the genius of man invented and applied countless astonishing arts, partly the result of necessity, partly the result of exuberant invention, so that this vigor of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is so active in the discovery not merely of superfluous but even of dangerous and destructive things, betokens an inexhaustible <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> in the nature which can invent, learn, or employ such arts? What wonderful&mdash; one might say stupefying&mdash; advances has <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> industry made in the arts of weaving and building, of agriculture and navigation! With what endless variety are designs in pottery, painting, and sculpture produced, and with what skill executed! What wonderful spectacles are exhibited in the theatres, which those who have not seen them cannot credit! How skillful the contrivances for catching, killing, or taming wild beasts! And for the injury of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, also, how many kinds of poisons, weapons, engines of destruction, have been invented, while for the preservation or restoration of health the appliances and remedies are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>! To provoke appetite and please the palate, what a variety of seasonings have been concocted! To express and gain entrance for thoughts, what a multitude and variety of signs there are, among which speaking and writing hold the first place! What ornaments has eloquence at command to delight the mind! What <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of song is there to captivate the ear! How many musical instruments and strains of harmony have been devised! What skill has been attained in measures and numbers! With what sagacity have the movements and connections of the stars been discovered! Who could tell the thought that has been spent upon nature, even though, despairing of recounting it in detail, he endeavored only to give a general view of it? In fine, even the defence of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and misapprehensions, which has illustrated the genius of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, cannot be sufficiently declared. For at present it is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind which adorns this mortal life which we are extolling, and not the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which lead to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. And since this great nature has certainly been created by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who administers all things He has made with absolute power and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, it could never have fallen into these miseries, nor have gone out of them to miseries <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, &mdash; saving only those who are redeemed,&mdash; had not an exceeding great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> been found in the first man from whom the rest have sprung.</p>

<p>Moreover, even in the body, though it dies like that of the beasts, and is in many ways weaker than theirs, what goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of the great Creator, is apparent! The organs of sense and the rest of the members, are not they so placed, the appearance, and form, and stature of the body as a whole, is it not so fashioned, as to indicate that it was made for the service of a reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Man has not been created stooping towards the earth, like the irrational animals; but his bodily form, erect and looking heavenwards, admonishes him to mind the things that are above. Then the marvellous nimbleness which has been given to the tongue and the hands, fitting them to speak, and write, and execute so many duties, and practise so many arts, does it not prove the excellence of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for which such an assistant was provided? And even apart from its adaptation to the work required of it, there is such a symmetry in its various parts, and so beautiful a proportion maintained, that one is at a loss to decide whether, in creating the body, greater regard was paid to utility or to beauty. Assuredly no part of the body has been created for the sake of utility which does not also contribute something to its beauty. And this would be all the more apparent, if we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> more precisely how all its parts are connected and adapted to one another, and were not limited in our observations to what appears on the surface; for as to what is covered up and hidden from our view, the intricate web of veins and nerves, the vital parts of all that lies under the skin, no one can discover it. For although, with a cruel <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for science, some medical men, who are called anatomists, have dissected the bodies of the dead, and sometimes even of sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who died under their knives, and have inhumanly pried into the secrets of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body to learn the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the disease and its exact seat, and how it might be cured, yet those relations of which I speak, and which form the concord,   or, as the Greeks call it, <q>harmony,</q> of the whole body outside and in, as of some instrument, no one has been able to discover, because no one has been audacious enough to seek for them. But if these could be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, then even the inward parts, which seem to have no beauty, would so delight us with their exquisite fitness, as to afford a profounder satisfaction to the mind&mdash; and the eyes are but its ministers&mdash; than the obvious beauty which gratifies the eye. There are some things, too, which have such a place in the body, that they obviously serve no useful purpose, but are solely for beauty, as <em>e.g</em>. the teats on a man's breast, or the beard on his face; for that this is for ornament, and not for protection, is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the bare faces of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who ought rather, as the weaker sex, to enjoy such a defence. If, therefore, of all those members which are exposed to our view, there is certainly not one in which beauty is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to utility, while there are some which serve no purpose but only beauty, I think it can readily be concluded that in the creation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body comeliness was more regarded than necessity. In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, necessity is a transitory thing; and the time is coming when we shall enjoy one another's beauty without any <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>&mdash;a condition which will specially redound to the praise of the Creator, who, as it is said in the psalm, has <q>put on praise and comeliness.</q> </p>

<p>How can I tell of the rest of creation, with all its beauty and utility, which the divine goodness has given to man to please his eye and serve his purposes, condemned though he is, and hurled into these labors and miseries? Shall I speak of the manifold and various loveliness of sky, and earth, and sea; of the plentiful supply and wonderful qualities of the light; of sun, moon, and stars; of the shade of trees; of the colors and perfume of flowers; of the multitude of birds, all differing in plumage and in song; of the variety of animals, of which the smallest in size are often the most wonderful&mdash;the works of ants and bees astonishing us more than the huge bodies of whales? Shall I speak of the sea, which itself is so grand a spectacle, when it arrays itself as it were in vestures of various colors, now running through every shade of green, and again becoming purple or blue? Is it not delightful to look at it in storm, and experience the soothing complacency which it inspires, by suggesting that we ourselves are not tossed and shipwrecked?  What shall I say of the numberless kinds of food to alleviate hunger, and the variety of seasonings to stimulate appetite which are scattered everywhere by nature, and for which we are not indebted to the art of cookery? How many natural appliances are there for preserving and restoring health! How grateful is the alternation of day and night! How pleasant the breezes that cool the air! How abundant the supply of clothing furnished us by trees and animals! Who can enumerate all the blessings we enjoy? &nbsp;If I were to attempt to detail and unfold only these few which I have indicated in the mass, such an enumeration would fill a volume. And all these are but the solace of the wretched and condemned, not the rewards of the blessed. What then shall these rewards be, if such be the blessings of a condemned state? What will He give to those whom He has <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> to life, who has given such things even to those whom He has <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> to death? What blessings will He in the blessed life shower upon those for whom, even in this state of misery, He has been willing that His only-begotten Son should endure such sufferings even to death? Thus the apostle reasons concerning those who are <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> to that kingdom: <q>He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also give us all things?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121665"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;8:32</a></span> When this promise is fulfilled, what shall we be? What blessings shall we receive in that kingdom, since already we have received as the pledge of them Christ's dying? In what condition shall the spirit of man be, when it has no longer any <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> at all; when it neither yields to any, nor is in bondage to any, nor has to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against any, but is perfected, and enjoys undisturbed peace with itself? Shall it not then <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things with certainty, and without any labor or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, when unhindered and joyfully it drinks the wisdom of God at the fountain-head? What shall the body be, when it is in every respect subject to the spirit, from which it shall draw a life so sufficient, as to stand in need of no other nutriment? For it shall no longer be animal, but spiritual, having indeed the substance of flesh, but without any fleshly corruption.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25.&mdash; Of the Obstinacy of Those Individuals Who Impugn the Resurrection of the Body, Though, as Was Predicted, the Whole World Believes It.</h2>

<p>The foremost of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> agree with us about the spiritual felicity enjoyed by the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the life to come; it is only the  resurrection of the flesh they call in question, and with all their might deny. But the mass of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, learned and unlearned, the world's wise men and its fools, have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and have left in meagre isolation the unbelievers, and have turned to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who in His own resurrection demonstrated the reality of that which seems to our adversaries absurd. For the world has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> this which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> predicted, as it was also predicted that the world would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>&mdash;a prediction not due to the sorceries of Peter,  since it was uttered so long before. He who has predicted these things, as I have already said, and am not ashamed to repeat, is the God before whom all other divinities tremble, as Porphyry himself owns, and seeks to prove, by testimonies from the oracles of these gods, and goes so far as to call Him <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and King. Far be it from us to interpret these predictions as they do who have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, along with the whole world, in that which it was predicted the world would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in. For why should we not rather understand them as the world does, whose belief was predicted, and leave that handful of unbelievers to their idle talk and obstinate and solitary infidelity? For if they maintain that they interpret them differently only to avoid charging Scripture with folly, and so doing an injury to that God to whom they bear so notable a testimony, is it not a much greater injury they do Him when they say that His predictions must be understood otherwise than the world <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> them, though He Himself praised, promised, accomplished this belief on the world's part? And why cannot He <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the body to rise again, and live for ever? Or is it not to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that He will do this, because it is an undesirable thing, and unworthy of God? Of His omnipotence, which effects so many great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, we have already said enough. If they wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what the Almighty cannot do, I shall tell them He cannot lie. Let us therefore <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what He can do, by refusing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what He cannot do. Refusing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He can lie, let them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He will do what He has promised to do; and let them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it as the world has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> He predicted, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> He praised, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> He promised, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> He now points to. But how do they prove that the resurrection is an undesirable thing? There shall then be no corruption, which is the only <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing about the body. I have already said enough about the order of the elements, and the other fanciful objections men raise; and in the thirteenth book I have, in my own judgment, sufficiently illustrated the facility of movement which the incorruptible body shall enjoy, judging from the ease and vigor we experience even now, when the body is in good health. Those who have either not read the former books, or wish to refresh their memory, may read them for themselves.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.&mdash; That the Opinion of Porphyry, that the Soul, in Order to Be Blessed, Must Be Separated from Every Kind of Body, is Demolished by Plato, Who Says that the Supreme God Promised the Gods that They Should Never Be Ousted from Their Bodies.</h2>

<p>But, say they, Porphyry tells us that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in order to be blessed, must escape connection with every kind of body. It does not avail, therefore, to say that the future body shall be incorruptible, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be blessed till delivered from every kind of body. But in the book above mentioned I have already sufficiently discussed this. This one thing only will I repeat&mdash;let <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, their master, correct his writings, and say that their gods, in order to be blessed, must quit their bodies, or, in other words, die; for he said that they were shut up in celestial bodies, and that, nevertheless, the God who made them promised them <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>&mdash;that is to say, an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> tenure of these same bodies, such as was not provided for them naturally, but only by the further intervention of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, that thus they might be assured of felicity. In this he obviously overturns their assertion that the resurrection of the body cannot be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> because it is impossible; for, according to him, when the uncreated God promised <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> to the created gods, He expressly said that He would do what was impossible. For <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> tells us that He said, <q>As you have had a beginning, so you cannot be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and incorruptible; yet you shall not decay, nor shall any <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> destroy you or prove stronger than my will, which more effectually binds you to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> than the bond of your nature keeps you from it.</q> If they who hear these words have, we do not say understanding, but ears, they cannot <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that God promised to the gods He had made that He would effect an impossibility. For He who says, <q>You cannot be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, but by my will you shall be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>,</q> what else does He say than this, <q>I shall make you what ye cannot be?</q> The body, therefore, shall be raised incorruptible, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, spiritual, by Him who, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, has promised to do that which is  impossible. Why then do they still exclaim that this which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has promised, which the world has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on God's promise as was predicted, is an impossibility? For what we say is, that the God who, even according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, does impossible things, will do this. It is not, then, necessary to the blessedness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that it be detached from a body of any kind whatever, but that it receive an incorruptible body. &nbsp;And in what incorruptible body will they more suitably <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> than in that in which they groaned when it was corruptible? For thus they shall not feel that dire craving which Virgil, in imitation of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, has ascribed to them when he says that they wish to return again to their bodies.  They shall not, I say, feel this desire to return to their bodies, since they shall have those bodies to which a return was desired, and shall, indeed, be in such thorough possession of them, that they shall never lose them even for the briefest moment, nor ever lay them down in death.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27.&mdash; Of the Apparently Conflicting Opinions of Plato and Porphyry, Which Would Have Conducted Them Both to the Truth If They Could Have Yielded to One Another.</h2>

<p>Statements were made by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and Porphyry singly, which if they could have seen their way to hold in common, they might possibly have became <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> said that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> could not exist <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> without bodies; for it was on this account, he said, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> even of wise men must some time or other return to their bodies. Porphyry, again, said that the purified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when it has returned to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, shall never return to the ills of this world. Consequently, if <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> had communicated to Porphyry that which he saw to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, though perfectly purified, and belonging to the wise and righteous, must return to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies; and if Porphyry, again, had imparted to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which he saw, that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, shall never return to the miseries of a corruptible body, so that they should not have each held only his own opinion, but should both have held both truths, I think they would have seen that it follows that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> return to their bodies, and also that these bodies shall be such as to afford them a blessed and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life. For, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, even <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> shall return to the body; according to Porphyry, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> shall not return to the ills of this world. Let Porphyry then say with <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, they shall return to the body; let <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> say with Porphyry, they shall not return to their old misery: and they will agree that they return to bodies in which they shall suffer no more. And this is nothing else than what God has promised&mdash;that He will give <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> felicity to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> joined to their own bodies. For this, I presume, both of them would readily concede, that if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are to be reunited to bodies, it shall be to their own bodies, in which they have endured the miseries of this life, and in which, to escape these miseries, they served God with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and fidelity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28.&mdash; What Plato or Labeo, or Even Varro, Might Have Contributed to the True Faith of the Resurrection, If They Had Adopted One Another's Opinions into One Scheme.</h2>

<p>Some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who have a liking for <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> on account of his magnificent style and the truths which he now and then uttered, say that he even held an opinion similar to our own regarding the resurrection of the dead. Cicero, however, alluding to this in his <em>Republic</em>, asserts that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> meant it rather as a playful fancy than as a reality; for he introduces a man  who had come to life again, and gave a narrative of his experience in corroboration of the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. Labeo, too, says that two men died on one day, and met at a cross-road, and that, being afterwards ordered to return to their bodies, they agreed to be friends for life, and were so till they died again. But the resurrection which these writers instance resembles that of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom we have ourselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to rise again, and who came back indeed to this life, but not so as never to die again. Marcus Varro, however, in his work <em>On the Origin of the Roman People</em>, records something more remarkable; I think his own words should be given. <q>Certain astrologers,</q> he says, <q>have written that men are destined to a new birth, which the Greeks call <em> palingenesy</em>. This will take place after four hundred and forty years have elapsed; and then the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the same body, which were formerly united in the person, shall again be reunited.</q> This Varro, indeed, or those nameless astrologers,&mdash; for he does not give us the names of the men whose statement he cites&mdash;have affirmed what is indeed not altogether <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; for once the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> have returned to the bodies they wore, they shall never afterwards leave them. Yet what they say upsets and demolishes much of that idle talk of our adversaries about the impossibility of the resurrection.  For those who have been or are of this opinion, have not thought it possible that bodies which have dissolved into air, or dust, or ashes, or water, or into the bodies of the beasts or even of the men that fed on them, should be restored again to that which they formerly were. And therefore, if <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and Porphyry, or rather, if their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> now living, agree with us that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> shall return to the body, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says, and that, nevertheless, they shall not return to misery, as Porphyry maintains, &mdash; if they accept the consequence of these two propositions which is taught by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that they shall receive bodies in which they may live <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> without suffering any misery&mdash;let them also adopt from Varro the opinion that they shall return to the same bodies as they were formerly in, and thus the whole question of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> resurrection of the body shall be resolved out of their own mouths.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29.&mdash; Of the Beatific Vision.</h2>

<p>And now let us consider, with such ability as God may vouchsafe, how the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall be employed when they are clothed in <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and spiritual bodies, and when the flesh shall live no longer in a fleshly but a spiritual fashion. And indeed, to tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I am at a loss to understand the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that employment, or, shall I rather say, repose and ease, for it has never come within the range of my bodily senses. And if I should speak of my mind or understanding, what is our understanding in comparison of its excellence? For then shall be that <q>peace of God which,</q> as the apostle says, <q>passes all understanding,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121669"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse7">Philippians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> &mdash; that is to say, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and perhaps all angelic understanding, but certainly not the divine. That it passes ours there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>; but if it passes that of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>&mdash;and he who says <q>all understanding</q> seems to make no exception in their favor&mdash;then we must understand him to mean that neither we nor the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> can understand, as God understands, the peace which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself enjoys. Doubtless this passes all understanding but His own. But as we shall one day be made to participate, according to our slender capacity, in His peace, both in ourselves, and with our neighbor, and with God our chief good, in this respect the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> understand the peace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in their own measure, and men too, though now far behind them, whatever spiritual advance they have made. For we must remember how great a man he was who said, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part, and we prophesy in part, until that which is perfect has come;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121670"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:9-10</a></span> and <q>Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121671"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:12</a></span> Such also is now the vision of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are also called our <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, because we, being rescued out of the power of darkness, and receiving the earnest of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, are translated into the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and already begin to belong to those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> with whom we shall enjoy that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and most delightful city of God of which we have now written so much. Thus, then, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God are our <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as Christ is God's and also ours. They are God's, because they have not abandoned Him; they are ours, because we are their fellow citizens. The Lord Jesus also said, <q>See that you despise not one of these little ones: for I say unto you, That in heaven their <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do always see the face of my Father which is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121672"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;18:10</a></span> As, then, they see, so shall we also see; but not yet do we thus see. Wherefore the apostle uses the words cited a little ago, <q>Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face.</q> This vision is reserved as the reward of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and of it the Apostle John also says, <q>When He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121673"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:2</a></span> By <q>the face</q> of God we are to understand His manifestation, and not a part of the body similar to that which in our bodies we call by that name.</p>

<p>And so, when I am asked how the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall be employed in that spiritual body, I do not say what I see, but I say what I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, according to that which I read in the psalm, <q>I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, therefore have I spoken.</q>  I say, then, they shall in the body see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but whether they shall see Him by means of the body, as now we see the sun, moon, stars, sea, earth, and all that is in it, that is a difficult question. For it is hard to say that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall then have such bodies that they shall not be able to shut and open their eyes as they please; while it is harder still to say that every one who shuts his eyes shall lose the vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Elisha, though at a distance, saw his servant Gehazi, who thought that his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> would escape his master's observation and accepted gifts from Naaman the Syrian, whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had cleansed from his foul <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, how much more shall the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the spiritual body see all things, not only though their eyes be shut, but though they themselves be at a great distance? For then shall be <q>that which is perfect,</q> of which the apostle says, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part, and we prophesy in part; but when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part shall be done away.</q> Then, that he  may illustrate as well as possible, by a simile, how superior the future life is to the life now lived, not only by ordinary men, but even by the foremost of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, he says, <q>When I was a child, I understood as a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, I put away childish things. Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part; but then shall I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even as also I am <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121675"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:11-12</a></span> If, then, even in this life, in which the prophetic power of remarkable men is no more worthy to be compared to the vision of the future life than childhood is to manhood, Elisha, though distant from his servant, saw him accepting gifts, shall we say that when that which is perfect has come, and the corruptible body no longer oppresses the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but is incorruptible and offers no impediment to it, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall need bodily eyes to see, though Elisha had no need of them to see his servant? For, following the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> version, these are the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> words: <q>Did not my heart go with you, when the man came out of his chariot to meet you, and you tooked his gifts?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121676"><a href="../bible/2ki005.htm#verse26">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;5:26</a></span> Or, as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Jerome rendered it from the Hebrew, <q>Was not my heart present when the man turned from his chariot to meet you?</q> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said that he saw this with his heart, miraculously aided by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as no one can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. But how much more abundantly shall the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> enjoy this gift when God shall be all in all? Nevertheless the bodily eyes also shall have their office and their place, and shall be used by the spirit through the spiritual body. For the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> did not forego the use of his eyes for seeing what was before them, though he did not need them to see his absent servant, and though he could have seen these present objects in spirit, and with his eyes shut, as he saw things far distant in a place where he himself was not. Far be it, then, from us to say that in the life to come the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall not see God when their eyes are shut, since they shall always see Him with the spirit.</p>

<p>But the question arises, whether, when their eyes are open, they shall see Him with the bodily eye? If the eyes of the spiritual body have no more power than the eyes which we now possess, manifestly God cannot be seen with them. They must be of a very different power if they can look upon that incorporeal nature which is not contained in any place, but is all in every place. For though we say that God is in heaven and on earth, as He, Himself says by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>I fill heaven and earth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121677"><a href="../bible/jer023.htm#verse24">Jeremiah&nbsp;23:24</a></span> we do not mean that there is one part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in heaven and another part on earth; but He is all in heaven and all on earth, not at alternate intervals of time, but both at once, as no bodily nature can be. The eye, then, shall have a vastly superior power&mdash;the power not of keen sight, such as is ascribed to serpents or eagles, for however keenly these animals see, they can discern nothing but bodily substances,&mdash; but the power of seeing things incorporeal. Possibly it was this great power of vision which was temporarily communicated to the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Job while yet in this mortal body, when he says to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear; but now my eye sees You: wherefore I abhor myself, and melt away, and count myself dust and ashes;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121678"><a href="../bible/job042.htm#verse5">Job&nbsp;42:5-6</a></span> although there is no reason why we should not understand this of the eye of the heart, of which the apostle says, <q>Having the eyes of your heart illuminated.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121679"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse18">Ephesians&nbsp;1:18</a></span> But that God shall be seen with these eyes no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doubts who believingly accepts what our God and Master says, <q>Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121680"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> But whether in the future life God shall also be seen with the bodily eye, this is now our question.</p>

<p>The expression of Scripture, <q>And all flesh shall see the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121681"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse6">Luke&nbsp;3:6</a></span> may without difficulty be understood as if it were said, <q>And every man shall see the Christ of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And He certainly was seen in the body, and shall be seen in the body when He judges quick and dead. And that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, many other passages of Scripture <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, but especially the words of the venerable Simeon, who, when he had received into his hands the infant Christ, said, <q>Now let Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word: for my eyes have seen Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121682"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;2:29-30</a></span> As for the words of the above-mentioned Job, as they are found in the Hebrew manuscripts, <q>And in my flesh I shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> they were a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of the resurrection of the flesh; yet he does not say <q>by the flesh.</q> And indeed, if he had said this, it would still be possible that Christ was meant by <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> for Christ shall be seen by the flesh in the flesh. But even understanding it of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is only equivalent to saying, I shall be in the flesh when I see God. Then the apostle's expression, <q>face to face,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121684"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:12</a></span> does not oblige us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we shall see God by the bodily face in which are the eyes of the body, for we shall see Him without intermission in spirit. And if the apostle had not  referred to the face of the inner man, he would not have said, <q>But we, with unveiled face beholding as in a glass the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord, are transformed into the same image, from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as by the spirit of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121685"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:18</a></span> In the same sense we understand what the Psalmist sings, <q>Draw near unto Him, and be enlightened; and your faces shall not be ashamed.</q>  For it is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we draw near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is an act of the spirit, not of the body. But as we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what degree of perfection the spiritual body shall attain&mdash;for here we speak of a matter of which we have no experience, and upon which the authority of Scripture does not definitely pronounce&mdash;it is necessary that the words of the Book of Wisdom be illustrated in us: <q>The thoughts of mortal men are timid, and our fore-castings uncertain.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121687"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse14">Wisdom&nbsp;9:14</a></span> </p>

<p>For if that reasoning of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, by which they attempt to make out that intelligible or mental objects are so seen by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and sensible or bodily objects so seen by the body, that the former cannot be discerned by the mind through the body, nor the latter by the mind itself without the body&mdash;if this reasoning were trustworthy, then it would certainly follow that God could not be seen by the eye even of a spiritual body. But this reasoning is exploded both by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reason and by prophetic authority. For who is so little acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as to say that God has no cognisance of sensible objects? Has He therefore a body, the eyes of which give Him this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? Moreover, what we have just been relating of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Elisha, does this not sufficiently show that bodily things can be discerned by the spirit without the help of the body? For when that servant received the gifts, certainly this was a bodily or material transaction, yet the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> saw it not by the body, but by the spirit. As, therefore, it is agreed that bodies are seen by the spirit, what if the power of the spiritual body shall be so great that spirit also is seen by the body? For God is a spirit. Besides, each man recognizes his own life&mdash; that life by which he now lives in the body, and which vivifies these earthly members and causes them to grow&mdash; by an interior sense, and not by his bodily eye; but the life of other men, though it is invisible, he sees with the bodily eye. For how do we distinguish between living and dead bodies, except by seeing at once both the body and the life which we cannot see save by the eye? But a life without a body we cannot see thus.</p>

<p>Wherefore it may very well be, and it is thoroughly credible, that we shall in the future world see the material forms of the new heavens and the new earth in such a way that we shall most distinctly recognize God everywhere present and governing all things, material as well as spiritual, and shall see Him, not as now we understand the invisible things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the things which are made, <span class="stiki" id="note121688"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;1:20</a></span> and see Him darkly, as in a mirror, and in part, and rather by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> than by bodily vision of material appearances, but by means of the bodies we shall wear and which we shall see wherever we turn our eyes. As we do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but see that the living men around us who are exercising vital functions are alive, though we cannot see their life without their bodies, but see it most distinctly by means of their bodies, so, wherever we shall look with those spiritual eyes of our future bodies, we shall then, too, by means of bodily substances behold <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though a spirit, ruling all things. Either, therefore, the eyes shall possess some quality similar to that of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, by which they may be able to discern spiritual things, and among these <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;a supposition for which it is difficult or even impossible to find any support in Scripture,&mdash; or, which is more easy to comprehend, God will be so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by us, and shall be so much before us, that we shall see Him by the spirit in ourselves, in one another, in Himself, in the new heavens and the new earth, in every created thing which shall then exist; and also by the body we shall see Him in every body which the keen vision of the eye of the spiritual body shall reach. Our thoughts also shall be visible to all, for then shall be fulfilled the words of the apostle, <q>Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the thoughts of the heart, and then shall every one have praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121689"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:5</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 30.&mdash; Of the Eternal Felicity of the City of God, and of the Perpetual Sabbath.</h2>

<p>How great shall be that felicity, which shall be tainted with no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which shall lack no good, and which shall afford leisure for the praises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who shall be all in all! For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what other employment there can be where no lassitude shall slacken activity, nor any want stimulate to labor. I am admonished also by the sacred song, in which I read or hear the words, <q>Blessed are they that dwell in Your house, O Lord; they will be still praising You.</q>  All the members  and organs of the incorruptible body, which now we see to be suited to various necessary uses, shall contribute to the praises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for in that life necessity shall have no place, but full, certain, secure, everlasting felicity. For all those parts  of the bodily harmony, which are distributed through the whole body, within and without, and of which I have just been saying that they at present elude our observation, shall then be discerned; and, along with the other great and marvellous discoveries which shall then kindle rational minds in praise of the great Artificer, there shall be the enjoyment of a beauty which appeals to the reason. What power of movement such bodies shall possess, I have not the audacity rashly to define, as I have not the ability to conceive. Nevertheless I will say that in any case, both in motion and at rest, they shall be, as in their appearance, seemly; for into that state nothing which is unseemly shall be admitted. One thing is certain, the body shall immediately be wherever the spirit wills, and the spirit shall will nothing which is unbecoming either to the spirit or to the body. True <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> shall be there, for it shall be denied to none who is worthy, nor yielded to any unworthy; neither shall any unworthy person so much as sue for it, for none but the worthy shall be there. True peace shall be there, where no one shall suffer opposition either from himself or any other. God Himself, who is the Author of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, shall there be its reward; for, as there is nothing greater or better, He has promised Himself. What else was meant by His word through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>I will be your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and you shall be my people,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121692"><a href="../bible/lev026.htm#verse12">Leviticus&nbsp;26:12</a></span> than, I shall be their satisfaction, I shall be all that men honorably desire&mdash;life, and health, and nourishment, and plenty, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and peace, and all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things? This, too, is the right interpretation of the saying of the apostle, <q>That God may be all in all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121693"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:28</a></span> He shall be the end of our desires who shall be seen without end, loved without cloy, praised without weariness. This outgoing of affection, this employment, shall certainly be, like <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life itself, common to all.</p>

<p>But who can conceive, not to say describe, what degrees of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall be awarded to the various degrees of merit? Yet it cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that there shall be degrees. And in that blessed city there shall be this great blessing, that no inferior shall <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> any superior, as now the archangels are not envied by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, because no one will wish to be what he has not received, though bound in strictest concord with him who has received; as in the body the finger does not seek to be the eye, though both members are harmoniously included in the complete structure of the body. And thus, along with his gift, greater or less, each shall receive this further gift of contentment to desire no more than he has.</p>

<p>Neither are we to suppose that because <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall have no power to delight them, <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> must be withdrawn. It will, on the contrary, be all the more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> free, because set free from delight in sinning to take unfailing delight in not sinning. For the first freedom of will which man received when he was created upright consisted in an ability not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also in an ability to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; whereas this last freedom of will shall be superior, inasmuch as it shall not be able to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This, indeed, shall not be a natural ability, but the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is one thing to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, another thing to be a partaker of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. God by nature cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but the partaker of God receives this inability from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And in this divine gift there was to be observed this gradation, that man should first receive a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> by which he was able not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and at last a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> by which he was not able to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash;the former being adapted to the acquiring of merit, the latter to the enjoying of the reward.  But the nature thus constituted, having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> when it had the ability to do so, it is by a more abundant <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that it is delivered so as to reach that freedom in which it cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For as the first <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> which <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> lost by sinning consisted in his being able not to die, while the last shall consist in his not being able to die; so the first <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> consisted in his being able not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the last in his not being able to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And thus <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> shall be as indefeasible as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For certainly by sinning we lost both <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; but when we lost <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, we did not lose the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of it. Are we to say that God Himself is not free because He cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? In that city, then, there shall be <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, one in all the citizens, and indivisible in each, delivered from all ill, filled with all good, enjoying indefeasibly the delights of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> joys, oblivious of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, oblivious of sufferings, and yet not so oblivious of its deliverance as to be ungrateful to its Deliverer.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, then, shall have an intellectual remembrance of its past ills; but, so far as regards sensible experience, they shall be quite forgotten. For a skillful physician <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, indeed, professionally almost all diseases; but  experimentally he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of a great number which he himself has never suffered from. As, therefore, there are two ways of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things&mdash;one by mental insight, the other by sensible experience, for it is one thing to understand all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> by the wisdom of a cultivated <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, another to understand them by the foolishness of an abandoned life&mdash;so also there are two ways of forgetting <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. For a well-instructed and learned man forgets them one way, and he who has experimentally suffered from them forgets them another&mdash;the former by neglecting what he has learned, the latter by escaping what he has suffered. &nbsp;And in this latter way the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall forget their past ills, for they shall have so thoroughly escaped them all, that they shall be quite blotted out of their experience. But their intellectual <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which shall be great, shall keep them acquainted not only with their own past woes, but with the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> sufferings of the lost. For if they were not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they had been miserable, how could they, as the Psalmist says, for ever sing the mercies of God? Certainly that city shall have no greater <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> than the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who redeemed us by His blood. There shall be accomplished the words of the psalm, <q>Be still, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am God.</q>  There shall be the great <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> which has no evening, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> celebrated among His first works, as it is written, <q>And God rested on the seventh day from all His works which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it He had rested from all His work which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> began to make.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121696"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;2:2-3</a></span> For we shall ourselves be the seventh day, when we shall be filled and replenished with God's blessing and sanctification. There shall we be still, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that He is that which we ourselves aspired to be when we fell away from Him, and listened to the voice of the seducer, <q>You shall be as gods,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121697"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse5">Genesis&nbsp;3:5</a></span> and so abandoned <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who would have made us as gods, not by deserting Him, but by participating in Him. For without Him what have we accomplished, save to perish in His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>? But when we are restored by Him, and perfected with greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, we shall have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> leisure to see that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for we shall be full of Him when He shall be all in all. For even our good works, when they are understood to be rather His than ours, are imputed to us that we may enjoy this <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> rest. For if we attribute them to ourselves, they shall be servile; for it is said of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, <q>You shall do no servile work in it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121698"><a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse14">Deuteronomy&nbsp;5:14</a></span> Wherefore also it is said by Ezekiel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>And I gave them my <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a> to be a sign between me and them, that they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am the Lord who sanctify them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121699"><a href="../bible/eze020.htm#verse12">Ezekiel&nbsp;20:12</a></span> This <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> shall be perfected when we shall be perfectly at rest, and shall perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> shall appear still more clearly if we count the ages as days, in accordance with the periods of time defined in Scripture, for that period will be found to be the seventh. The first age, as the first day, extends from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to the deluge; the second from the deluge to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, equalling the first, not in length of time, but in the number of generations, there being ten in each. From <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to the advent of Christ there are, as the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> Matthew calculates, three periods, in each of which are fourteen generations&mdash;one period from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to David, a second from David to the captivity, a third from the captivity to the birth of Christ in the flesh. There are thus five ages in all. The sixth is now passing, and cannot be measured by any number of generations, as it has been said, <q>It is not for you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the times, which the Father has put in His own power.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note121700"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse7">Acts&nbsp;1:7</a></span> After this period God shall rest as on the seventh day, when He shall give us (who shall be the seventh day) rest in Himself.  But there is not now space to treat of these ages; suffice it to say that the seventh shall be our <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, which shall be brought to a close, not by an evening, but by the Lord's day, as an eighth and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> day, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and prefiguring the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> repose not only of the spirit, but also of the body. There we shall rest and see, see and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and praise. This is what shall be in the end without end. For what other end do we propose to ourselves than to attain to the kingdom of which there is no end?</p>

<p>I think I have now, by God's help, discharged my obligation in writing this large work. Let those who think I have said too little, or those who think I have said too much, forgive me; and let those who think I have said just enough join me in giving thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
