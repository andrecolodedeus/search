<h1>The Confessions (Book V)</h1>

<p class="h1a">He describes the twenty-ninth year of his age, in which, having discovered the fallacies of the Manich&aelig;ans, he professed rhetoric at Rome and Milan. Having heard Ambrose, he begins to come to himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1. That It Becomes the Soul to Praise God, and to Confess Unto Him.</h2>

<p>1. Accept the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of my confessions by the agency of my tongue, which You have formed and quickened, that it may confess to Your name; and heal Thou all my bones, and let them say, <q>Lord, who is like You?</q>  For neither does he who confesses to You teach You what may be passing within him, because a closed heart does not exclude Your eye, nor does man's hardness of heart repulse Your hand, but You dissolve it when You will, either in pity or in vengeance, <q>and there is no One who can hide himself from Your heart.</q>  But let my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> praise You, that it may <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> You; and let it confess Your own mercies to You, that it may praise You. Your whole creation ceases not, nor is it silent in Your praises&mdash; neither the spirit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by the voice directed unto You, nor animal nor corporeal things, by the voice of those meditating thereon;  so that our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> may from their weariness arise towards You, leaning on those things which You have made, and passing on to You, who hast made them wonderfully and there is there refreshment and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> strength.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. On the Vanity of Those Who Wished to Escape the Omnipotent God.</h2>

<p>2. Let the restless and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> depart and flee from You. Thou both see them and distinguishest the shadows. And lo! All things with them are fair, yet are they themselves foul.  And how have they injured You?  Or in what have they disgraced Your government, which is just and perfect from heaven even to the lowest parts of the earth. For whither fled they when they fled from Your presence?  Or where do    You not find them? But they fled that they might not see You seeing them, and blinded might stumble against You; <span class="stiki" id="note110358"><a href="../bible/gen016.htm#verse13">Genesis&nbsp;16:13-14</a></span> since You forsake nothing that You have made &mdash; that the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> might stumble against You, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> be hurt,  withdrawing themselves from Your gentleness, and stumbling against Your uprightness, and falling upon their own roughness. Forsooth, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not that You are everywhere whom no place encompasses, and that You alone are near even to those that remove far from You.  Let them, then, be converted  and seek You; because not as they have forsaken their Creator have You forsaken Your creature. Let them be converted and seek You; and behold, You are there in their hearts, in the hearts of those who confess to You, and cast themselves upon You, and weep on Your bosom after their obdurate ways, even Thou gently wiping away their tears. And they weep the more, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in weeping, since Thou, O Lord, not man, flesh and blood, but Thou, Lord, who made, remakest and comfortest them. And where was I when I was seeking You? And You were before me, but I had gone away even from myself; nor did I find myself, much less You!</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Having Heard Faustus, the Most Learned Bishop of the Manich&aelig;ans, He Discerns that God, the Author Both of Things Animate and Inanimate, Chiefly Has Care for the Humble.</h2>

<p>3. Let me lay bare before my God that twenty-ninth year of my age. There had at this time come to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> a certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, by name Faustus, a great snare of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and in any were entangled by him through the allurement of his smooth speech; the which, although I did commend, yet could I separate from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of those things which I was eager to learn. Nor did I esteem the small dish of oratory so much as the science, which this their so praised Faustus placed before me to feed upon. Fame, indeed, had before spoken of him to me, as most skilled in all becoming learning, and pre-eminently skilled in the liberal sciences. And as I had read and retained in memory many injunctions of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, I used to compare some teachings of theirs with those long fables of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> and the former things which they declared, who could only prevail so far as to estimate this lower world, while its lord they could by no means find out, <span class="stiki" id="note110362"><a href="../bible/wis013.htm#verse9">Wisdom&nbsp;13:9</a></span> seemed to me the more probable. For You are great, O Lord, and hast respect unto the lowly, but the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> afar off.  Nor do    You draw near but to the contrite heart,  nor are You found by the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, &mdash; not even could they number by cunning skill the stars and the sand, and measure the starry regions, and trace the courses of the planets.</p>

<p>4. For with their understanding and the capacity which You have bestowed upon them they search out these things; and much have they found out, and foretold many years before&mdash;the eclipses of those luminaries, the sun and moon, on what day, at what hour, and from how many particular points they were likely to come. Nor did their calculation fail them; and it came to pass even as they foretold. And they wrote down the rules found out, which are read at this day; and from these others foretell in what year and in what month of the year, and on what day of the month, and at what hour of the day, and at what quarter of its light, either moon or sun is to be eclipsed, and thus it shall be even as it is foretold. And men who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of these things marvel and are amazed, and they that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them exult and are exalted; and by an impious <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, departing from You, and forsaking Your light, they foretell a failure of the sun's light which is likely to occur so long before, but see not their own, which is now present. For they seek not religiously whence they have the ability where-with they seek out these things. And finding that You have made them, they give not themselves up to You, that You may preserve what You have made, nor <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> themselves to You, even such as they have made themselves to be; nor do they slay their own <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, as fowls of the air,  nor their own curiosities, by which (like the fishes of the sea) they wander over the unknown paths of the abyss, nor their own extravagance, as the <q>beasts of the field,</q>  that Thou, Lord, <q>a consuming fire,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note110368"><a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse24">Deuteronomy&nbsp;4:24</a></span> may burn up their lifeless cares and renew them immortally.</p>

<p>5. But the way&mdash; Your Word, <span class="stiki" id="note110369"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> by whom Thou made these things which they number, and themselves who number, and the sense by which they perceive what they number, and the judgment out of which they number&mdash; they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, and that of Your wisdom there is no number.  But the Only-begotten has been <q>made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note110371"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse30">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:30</a></span> and has been numbered among us, and paid tribute to C&aelig;sar. <span class="stiki" id="note110372"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;17:27</a></span> This way, by which they might descend to Him from themselves, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not; nor that through Him they might ascend unto Him.  This way they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, and they think themselves exalted with the stars <span class="stiki" id="note110374"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;14:13</a></span> and shining, and lo! They fell upon the earth, <span class="stiki" id="note110375"><a href="../bible/rev012.htm#verse4">Revelation&nbsp;12:4</a></span> and <q>their foolish heart was darkened.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note110376"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;1:21</a></span> They say many <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> things concerning the creature; but Truth, the Artificer of the creature, they seek not with devotion, and hence they find Him not. Or if they find Him, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they glorify Him not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither are they thankful, <span class="stiki" id="note110377"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;1:21</a></span> but become vain in their imaginations, and say that they themselves are wise, <span class="stiki" id="note110378"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse22">Romans&nbsp;1:22</a></span> attributing to themselves what is Yours; and by this, with most perverse blindness, they desire to impute to You what is their own, forging lies against You who art the Truth, and changing the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things, <span class="stiki" id="note110379"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;1:23</a></span> &mdash; changing Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> into a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, and worshipping and serving the creature more than the Creator. <span class="stiki" id="note110380"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;1:25</a></span> </p>

<p>6. Many truths, however, concerning the creature did I retain from these men, and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> appeared to me from calculations, the succession of seasons, and the visible manifestations of the stars; and I compared them with the sayings of Manich&aelig;us, who in his frenzy has written most extensively on these subjects, but discovered not any account either of the solstices, or the equinoxes, the eclipses of the luminaries, or anything of the kind I had learned in the books of secular <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. But therein I was ordered to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and yet it corresponded not with those rules acknowledged by calculation and my own sight, but was far different.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. That the Knowledge of Terrestrial and Celestial Things Does Not Give Happiness, But the Knowledge of God Only.</h2>

<p>7. Does, then, O Lord God of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whosoever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> those things therefore please You? For unhappy is the man who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all those things, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> You not; but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> is he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> You, though these he may not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.  But he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> both You and them is not the happier on account of them, but is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> on account of You only, if <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> You he glorify You as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and gives thanks, and becomes not vain in his thoughts. <span class="stiki" id="note110382"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;1:21</a></span> But as he is happier who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to possess a tree, and for the use thereof renders thanks to You, although he may not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how many cubits high it is, or how wide it spreads, than he that measures it and counts all its branches, and neither owns it nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> or loves its Creator; so a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man, whose is the entire world of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>,  and who, as having nothing, yet possesses all things <span class="stiki" id="note110384"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:10</a></span> by cleaving unto You, to whom all things are subservient, though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not even the circles of the Great Bear, yet it is foolish to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that he may verily be better than he who can measure the heavens, and number the stars, and weigh the elements, but is forgetful of You, <q>who hast set in order all things in number, weight, and measure.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note110385"><a href="../bible/wis011.htm#verse20">Wisdom&nbsp;11:20</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Of Manich&aelig;us Pertinaciously Teaching False Doctrines, and Proudly Arrogating to Himself the Holy Spirit.</h2>

<p>8. But yet who was it that ordered Manich&aelig;us to write on these things likewise, skill in which was not necessary to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>? For You have told man to behold <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and wisdom,  of which he might be in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> although having a complete <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these other things; but since, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> not these things, he yet most impudently dared to teach them, it is clear that he had no acquaintance with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. For even when we have a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these worldly matters, it is folly to make a profession of them; but confession to You is <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. It was therefore with this view that this straying one spoke much of these matters, that, standing convicted by those who had in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> learned them, the understanding that he really had in those more difficult things might be made plain. For he wished not to be lightly esteemed, but went about trying to persuade men <q>that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the Comforter and Enricher of Your faithful ones, was with full authority personally resident in him.</q>  When, therefore, it was discovered  that his teaching concerning the heavens and stars, and the motions of sun and moon, was false, though these things do not relate to the doctrine of religion, yet his <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> arrogance would become sufficiently evident, seeing that not only did he affirm things of which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing, but also perverted them, and with such egregious vanity of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> as to seek to attribute them to himself as to a divine being.</p>

<p>9. For when I hear a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> brother <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of these things, or in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> concerning them, I can bear with patience to see that man hold to his opinions; nor can I apprehend that any want of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as to the situation or nature of this material creation can be injurious to him, so long as he does not entertain belief in anything unworthy of You, O Lord, the Creator of all. But if he conceives it to pertain to the form of the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and presumes to affirm with great obstinacy that whereof he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, therein lies the injury. And yet even a weakness such as this in the dawn of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is borne by our Mother Charity, till the new man may grow up <q>unto a perfect man,</q> and not be <q>carried about with every wind of doctrine.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note110388"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;4:13-14</a></span> But in him who thus presumed to be at once the teacher, author, head, and leader of all whom he could induce to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this, so that all who followed him <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that they were following not a simple man only, but Your <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who would not judge that such great insanity, when once it stood convicted of false teaching, should be abhorred and utterly cast off? But I had not yet clearly ascertained whether the changes of longer and shorter days and nights, and day and night itself, with the eclipses of the greater lights, and whatever of the like kind I had read in other books, could be expounded consistently with his words. Should I have found myself able to do so, there would still have remained a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in my mind whether it were so or no, although I might, on the strength of his reputed godliness,  rest my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on his authority.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Faustus Was Indeed an Elegant Speaker, But Knew Nothing of the Liberal Sciences.</h2>

<p>10. And for nearly the whole of those nine years during which, with unstable <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, I had been their follower, I had been looking forward with but too great eagerness for the arrival of this same Faustus. For the other members of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> whom I had chanced to light upon, when unable to answer the questions I raised, always bade me look forward to his coming, when, by discoursing with him, these, and greater difficulties if I had them, would be most easily and amply cleared away. When at last he did come, I found him to be a man of pleasant speech, who spoke of the very same things as they themselves did, although more fluently, and in better language. But of what profit to me was the elegance of my cup-bearer, since he offered me not the more precious draught for which I thirsted? My ears were already satiated with similar things; neither did they appear to me more conclusive, because better expressed; nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, because oratorical; nor the spirit necessarily wise, because the face was comely and the language eloquent. But they who extolled him to me were not competent judges; and therefore, as he was possessed of suavity of speech, he appeared to them to be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> and wise. Another sort of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, however, was, I was aware, suspicious even of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, if enunciated in smooth and flowing language. But me, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, You had already instructed by wonderful and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> ways, and therefore I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that You instructed me because it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; nor of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is there any other teacher&mdash; where or whencesoever it may shine upon us &mdash; but You. From You, therefore, I had now learned, that because a thing is eloquently expressed, it should not of necessity seem to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; nor, because uttered with stammering lips, should it be false nor, again, perforce <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, because unskilfully delivered; nor consequently untrue, because the language is fine; but that wisdom and folly are as food both wholesome and unwholesome, and courtly or simple words as town-made or rustic vessels&mdash;and both kinds of food may be served in either kind of dish.</p>

<p>11. That eagerness, therefore, with which I had so long waited for this man was in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> delighted with his action and feeling when disputing, and the fluent and apt words with which he clothed his ideas. I was therefore filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and joined with others (and even exceeded them) in exalting and praising him. It was, however, a source of annoyance to me that I was not allowed at those meetings of his auditors to introduce and impart  any of those questions that troubled me in familiar exchange of arguments with him. When I might speak, and began, in conjunction with my friends, to engage his attention at such times as it was not unseeming for him to enter into a discussion with me, and had mooted such questions as perplexed me, I discovered him first to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of the liberal sciences save grammar, and that only in an ordinary way. Having, however, read some of Tully's <em>Orations</em>, a very few books of Seneca and some of the poets, and such few volumes of his own <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> as were written coherently in Latin, and being day by day practised in speaking, he so acquired a sort of eloquence, which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the more delightful and enticing in that it was under the control of ready tact, and a sort of native <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Is it not even as I recall, O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Thou judge of my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>? My heart and my memory are laid before You, who at that time directed me by the inscrutable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Your Providence, and set before my face those vile <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of mine, in order that I might see and loathe them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Clearly Seeing the Fallacies of the Manich&aelig;ans, He Retires from Them, Being Remarkably Aided by God.</h2>

<p>12. For when it became plain to me that he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of those arts in which I had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him to excel, I began to despair of his clearing up and explaining all the perplexities which harassed me: though <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of these, however, he might still have held the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, had he not been a <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a>. For their books are full of lengthy fables  concerning the heaven and stars, the sun and moon, and I had ceased to think him able to decide in a satisfactory manner what I ardently desired&mdash;whether, on comparing these things with the calculations I had read elsewhere, the explanations contained in the works of Manich&aelig;us were preferable, or at any rate equally sound? But when I proposed that these subjects should be deliberated upon and reasoned out, he very modestly did not dare to endure the burden. For he was aware that he had no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these things, and was not ashamed to confess it. For he was not one of those loquacious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, many of whom I had been troubled with, who covenanted to teach me these things, and said nothing; but this man possessed a heart, which, though not right towards You, yet was not altogether false towards himself. For he was not altogether <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, nor would he without due consideration be inveigled in a controversy, from which he could neither draw back nor extricate himself fairly. And for that I was even more pleased with him, for more beautiful is the modesty of an ingenuous mind than the acquisition of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> I desired&mdash;and such I found him to be in all the more abstruse and subtle questions.</p>

<p>13. My eagerness after the writings of Manich&aelig;us having thus received a check, and despairing even more of their other teachers&mdash;seeing that in sundry things which puzzled me, he, so famous among them, had thus turned out&mdash;I began to occupy myself with him in the study of that literature which he also much affected, and which I, as Professor of Rhetoric, was then engaged in teaching the young Carthaginian students, and in reading with him either what he expressed a wish to hear, or I deemed suited to his bent of mind. But all my endeavours by which I had concluded to improve in that <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, by acquaintance with that man, came completely to an end: not that I separated myself altogether from them, but, as one who could find nothing better, I determined in the meantime upon contenting myself with what I had in any way lighted upon, unless, by chance, something more desirable should present itself. Thus that Faustus, who had entrapped so many to their death&mdash;neither willing nor witting it&mdash;now began to loosen the snare in which I had been taken. For Your hands, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the hidden design of Your Providence, did not desert my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and out of the blood of my mother's heart, through the tears that she poured out by day and by night, was a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> offered unto You for me; and by marvellous ways did Thou deal with me. <span class="stiki" id="note110393"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse26">Joel&nbsp;2:26</a></span> It was Thou, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who did it, for the steps of a man are ordered by the Lord, and He shall dispose his way.  Or how can we procure <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> but from Your hand, remaking what it has made?</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. He Sets Out for Rome, His Mother in Vain Lamenting It.</h2>

<p>14. You dealt with me, therefore, that I should be persuaded to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and teach there rather what I was then teaching at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>. And how I was persuaded to do this, I will not fail to confess unto You; for in this also the profoundest workings of Your wisdom, and Your ever present mercy to usward, must be pondered and avowed. It was not my desire to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> because greater advantages and dignities were guaranteed me by the friends who persuaded me into this&mdash;although even at this period I was influenced by these considerations&mdash;but my principal and almost sole motive was, that I had been informed that the youths studied more quietly there, and were kept under by the control of more rigid discipline, so that they did not capriciously and impudently rush into the school of a master not their own, into whose presence they were forbidden to enter unless with his consent. At <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, on the contrary, there was among the scholars a shameful and intemperate license. They burst in rudely, and, with almost <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> gesticulations, interrupt the system which any one may have instituted for the good of his pupils. Many outrages they perpetrate with astounding phlegm, which would be punishable by law were they not sustained by custom; that custom showing them to be the more worthless, in that they now do, as according to law, what by Your unchangeable law will never be lawful. And they fancy they do it with impunity, whereas the very blindness whereby they do it is their punishment, and they suffer far greater things than they do. The manners, then, which as a student I would not adopt,  I was compelled as a teacher to submit to from others; and so I was too glad to go where all who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> anything about it assured me that similar things were not done. But You, <q>my refuge and my portion in the land of the living,</q>  while at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> goaded me, so that I might thereby be withdrawn from it, and exchange my worldly habitation for the preservation of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; while at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> You offered me enticements by which to attract me there, by men enchanted with this dying life&mdash;the one doing insane actions, and the other making assurances of vain things; and, in order to correct my footsteps, secretly employed their and my perversity. For both they who disturbed my tranquillity were blinded by a shameful <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, and they who allured me elsewhere smacked of the earth. And I, who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> real misery here, sought fictitious <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> there.</p>

<p>15. But the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of my going thence and going there, You, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a>, yet revealed it not, either to me or to my mother, who grievously lamented my journey, and went with me as far as the sea. But I deceived her, when she violently restrained me either that she might retain me or accompany me, and I pretended that I had a friend whom I could not quit until he had a favourable wind to set sail. And I lied to my mother&mdash; and such a mother!&mdash; and got away. For this also You have in mercy pardoned me, saving me, thus replete with abominable pollutions, from the waters of the sea, for the water of Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whereby, when I was purified, the fountains of my mother's eyes should be dried, from which for me she day by day watered the ground under her face. And yet, refusing to go back without me, it was with difficulty I persuaded her to remain that night in a place quite close to our ship, where there was an oratory  in memory of the blessed Cyprian. That night I secretly left, but she was not backward in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and weeping. And what was it, O Lord, that she, with such an abundance of tears, was asking of You, but that You would not permit me to sail? But You, mysteriously counselling and hearing the real purpose of her desire, granted not what she then asked, in order to make me what she was ever asking. The wind blew and filled our sails, and withdrew the shore from our sight; and she, wild with grief, was there on the morrow, and filled Your ears with complaints and groans, which You disregarded; while, by the means of my longings, You were hastening me on to the cessation of all longing, and the gross part of her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to me was whipped out by the just lash of sorrow. But, like all mothers&mdash;though even more than others&mdash;she loved to have me with her, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> You were preparing for her by my absence. Being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this, she did weep and mourn, and in her agony was seen the inheritance of Eve,&mdash; seeking in sorrow what in sorrow she had brought forth. And yet, after accusing my perfidy and cruelty, she again continued her intercessions for me with You, returned to her accustomed place, and I to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Being Attacked by Fever, He is in Great Danger.</h2>

<p>16. And behold, there was I received by the scourge of bodily sickness, and I was descending into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> burdened with all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that I had committed, both against You, myself, and others, many and grievous, over and above that bond of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whereby we all die in Adam. <span class="stiki" id="note110398"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:22</a></span> For none of these things had Thou forgiven me in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, neither had He <q>abolished</q> by His cross <q>the enmity</q>  which, by my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, I had incurred with You. For how could He, by the crucifixion of a phantasm,  which I supposed Him to be? As <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, then, was the death of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as that of His flesh appeared to me to be untrue; and as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> the death of His flesh as the life of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it not, was false. The fever increasing, I was now passing away and perishing. For had I then gone hence, whither should I have gone but into the fiery torments meet for my misdeeds, in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of Your ordinance? She was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this, yet, while absent, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for me. But You, everywhere present, hearkened to her where she was, and had pity upon me where I was, that I should regain my bodily health, although still frenzied in my <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> heart. For all that peril did not make me wish to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and I was better when, as a lad, I entreated it of my mother's <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, as I have already related and confessed.  But I had grown up to my own dishonour, and all the purposes of Your medicine I madly derided,  who would not suffer me, though such a one, to die a double death. Had my mother's heart been smitten with this wound, it never could have been cured. For I cannot sufficiently express the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> she had for me, nor how she now travailed for me in the spirit with a far keener anguish than when she bore me in the flesh.</p>

<p>17. I cannot conceive, therefore, how she could have been healed if such a death of mine had transfixed the bowels of her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Where then would have been her so earnest, frequent, and unintermitted <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to You alone? But could Thou, most merciful <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, despise the <q>contrite and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> heart</q>  of that pure and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, so constant in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a>, so gracious and attentive to Your <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, not permitting one day to pass without oblation at Your altar, twice a day, at morning and even-tide, coming to Your church without intermission&mdash; not for vain gossiping, nor old wives' <q>fables,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note110404"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:10</a></span> but in order that she might listen to You in Your sermons, and Thou to her in her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>?  Could You&mdash; You by whose gift she was such&mdash; despise and disregard without succouring the tears of such a one, wherewith she entreated You not for gold or silver, nor for any changing or fleeting good, but for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of her son? By no means, Lord. Assuredly You were near, and were hearing and doing in that method in which You had predetermined that it should be done. Far be it from You that Thou should delude her in those visions and the answers she had from You&mdash;some of which I have spoken of,  and others not, &mdash; which she kept <span class="stiki" id="note110408"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;2:19</a></span> in her faithful breast, and, always petitioning, pressed upon You as Your autograph. For Thou, <q>because Your mercy endures for ever,</q>  condescendest to those whose debts You have pardoned, to become likewise a debtor by Your promises.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. When He Had Left the Manich&aelig;ans, He Retained His Depraved Opinions Concerning Sin and the Origin of the Saviour.</h2>

<p>18. You restored me then from that illness, and made sound the son of Your hand-maid meanwhile in body, that he might live for You, to endow him with a higher and more enduring health. And even then at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> I joined those deluding and deluded <q><a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>;</q> not their <q>hearers</q> only&mdash;of the number of whom was he in whose house I had fallen ill, and had recovered&mdash;but those also whom they designate <q>The Elect.</q>  For it still seemed to me <q>that it was not we that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what other nature <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in us.</q>  And it gratified my <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to be free from blame and, after I had committed any fault, not to acknowledge that I had done any&mdash;<q>that You might heal my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> because it had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against You;</q>  but I loved to excuse it, and to accuse something else (I know not what) which was with me, but was not I. But assuredly it was wholly I, and my impiety had divided me against myself; and that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was all the more incurable in that I did not deem myself a sinner. And execrable iniquity it was, O God <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, that I would rather have You to be overcome in me to my destruction, than myself of You to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>! Not yet, therefore, had Thou set a watch before my mouth, and kept the door of my lips, that my heart might not incline to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> speeches, to make excuses of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, with men that work iniquity &mdash; and, therefore, was I still united with their <q>Elect.</q></p>

<p>19. But now, hopeless of making proficiency in that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a>, even those things with which I had decided upon contenting myself, providing that I could find nothing better, I now held more loosely and negligently. For I was half inclined to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that those <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> whom they call <q>Academics</q>  were more sagacious than the rest, in that they held that we ought to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> everything, and ruled that man had not the power of comprehending any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for so, not yet realizing their meaning, I also was fully persuaded that they thought just as they are commonly held to do. And I did not fail frankly to restrain in my host that assurance which I observed him to have in those fictions of which the works of Manich&aelig;us are full. Notwithstanding, I was on terms of more intimate friendship with them than with others who were not of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Nor did I defend it with my former ardour; still my familiarity with that <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> (many of them being concealed in Rome) made me slower  to seek any other way&mdash;particularly since I was hopeless of finding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, from which in Your Church, O Lord of heaven and earth, Creator of all things visible and invisible, they had turned me aside&mdash;and it seemed to me most unbecoming to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> You to have the form of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, and to be bounded by the bodily lineaments of our members. And because, when I desired to meditate on my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what to think of but a mass of bodies  (for what was not such did not seem to me to be), this was the greatest and almost sole <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of my inevitable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>

<p>20. For hence I also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be a similar sort of substance, and to be possessed of its own foul and misshapen mass&mdash; whether dense, which they denominated earth, or thin and subtle, as is the body of the air, which they fancy some malignant spirit crawling through that earth. And because a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>&mdash; such as it was&mdash; compelled me to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the good God never created any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> nature, I conceived two masses, the one opposed to the other, both <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> the more contracted, the good the more expansive. And from this mischievous commencement the other profanities followed on me. For when my mind tried to revert to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, I was cast back, since what I had held to be the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was not so. And it appeared to me more devout  to look upon You, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;to whom I make confession of Your mercies&mdash;as <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, at least, on other sides, although on that side where the mass of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was in opposition to You  I was compelled to confess You finite, that if on every side I should conceive You to be confined by the form of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body. And better did it seem to me to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> had been created by You&mdash; which to me in my <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> appeared not only some substance, but a bodily one, because I had no conception of the mind excepting as a subtle body, and that diffused in local spaces&mdash; than to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that anything could emanate from You of such a kind as I considered the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be. And our very Saviour Himself, also, Your only-begotten,  I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have been reached forth, as it were, for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> out of the lump of Your most effulgent mass, so as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> nothing of Him but what I was able to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> in my vanity. Such a nature, then, I thought could not be born of the Virgin Mary without being mingled with the flesh; and how that which I had thus figured to myself could be mingled without being contaminated, I saw not. I was afraid, therefore, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to be born in the flesh, lest I should be compelled to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him contaminated by the flesh.  Now will Your spiritual ones blandly and lovingly smile at me if they shall read these my confessions; yet such was I.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Helpidius Disputed Well Against the Manich&aelig;ans as to the Authenticity of the New Testament.</h2>

<p>21. Furthermore, whatever they had censured  in Your Scriptures I thought impossible to be defended; and yet sometimes, indeed, I desired to confer on these several points with some one well learned in those books, and to try what he thought of them. For at this time the words of one Helpidius, speaking and disputing face to face against the said <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, had begun to move me even at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, in that he brought forth things from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> not easily withstood, to which their answer appeared to me feeble. And this answer they did not give forth publicly, but only to us in private&mdash;when they said that the writings of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> had been tampered with by I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whom, who were desirous of ingrafting the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish law</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;  but they themselves did not bring forward any uncorrupted copies.  But I, thinking of corporeal things, very much ensnared and in a measure stifled, was oppressed by those masses;  panting under which for the breath of Your Truth, I was not able to breathe it pure and undefiled.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Professing Rhetoric at Rome, He Discovers the Fraud of His Scholars.</h2>

<p>22. Then began I assiduously to practise that for which I came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>&mdash; the teaching of rhetoric; and first to bring together at my home some to whom, and through whom, I had begun to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; when, behold, I learned that other offenses were committed in Rome which I had not to bear in Africa. For those subvertings by abandoned young men were not practised here, as I had been informed; yet, suddenly, said they, to evade paying their master's fees, many of the youths conspire together, and remove themselves to another&mdash;breakers of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who, for the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>, set a small value on <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. These also my heart <q><a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>,</q> though not with a <q>perfect <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>;</q>  for, perhaps, I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> them more in that I was to suffer by them, than for the illicit acts they committed. Such of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are base <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and they are unfaithful to You, loving these transitory mockeries of temporal things, and vile gain, which begrimes the hand that lays hold on it; and embracing the fleeting world, and scorning You, who abides, and invites to return, and pardons the prostituted <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> when it returns to You. And now I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> such crooked and perverse men, although I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them if they are to be corrected so as to prefer the learning they obtain to money, and to learning You, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and fullness of certain good and most chaste peace. But then was the wish stronger in me for my own sake not to suffer them <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, than was the wish that they should become good for Yours.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. He is Sent to Milan, that He, About to Teach Rhetoric, May Be Known by Ambrose.</h2>

<p>23. When, therefore, they of Milan had sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to the prefect of the city, to provide them with a teacher of rhetoric for their city, and to dispatch him at the public expense, I made interest through those identical <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, drunk with <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> vanities, to be freed from whom I was going away&mdash;neither of us, however, being aware of it&mdash;that Symmachus, the then prefect, having <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> me by proposing a subject, would send me. And to Milan I came, unto Ambrose the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the whole world as among the best of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, Your devout servant; whose eloquent discourse did at that time strenuously dispense unto Your people the flour of Your wheat, the <q><a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a></q> of Your <q>oil,</q> and the sober intoxication of Your <q>wine.</q>  To him was I unknowingly led by You, that by him I might knowingly be led to You. That man of God received me like a father, and looked with a benevolent and episcopal kindliness on my change of abode. And I began to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him, not at first, indeed, as a teacher of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash;which I entirely despaired of in Your Church,&mdash; but as a man friendly to myself. And I studiously hearkened to him preaching to the people, not with the motive I should, but, as it were, trying to discover whether his eloquence came up to the fame thereof, or flowed fuller or lower than was asserted; and I hung on his words intently, but of the matter I was but as a careless and contemptuous spectator; and I was delighted with the pleasantness of his speech, more erudite, yet less cheerful and soothing in manner, than that of Faustus. Of the matter, however, there could be no comparison; for the latter was straying amid <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> deceptions, while the former was teaching <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> most soundly. But <q><a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is far from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>,</q>  such as I then stood before him; and yet I was drawing nearer gradually and unconsciously.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Having Heard the Bishop, He Perceives the Force of the Catholic Faith, Yet Doubts, After the Manner of the Modern Academics.</h2>

<p>24. For although I took no trouble to learn what he spoke, but only to hear how he spoke (for that empty care alone remained to me, despairing of a way accessible for man to You), yet, together with the words which I prized, there came into my mind also the things about which I was careless; for I could not separate them. And while I opened my heart to admit <q>how skilfully he spoke,</q> there also entered with it, but gradually, <q>and how <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> he spoke!</q> For first, these things also had begun to appear to me to be defensible; and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for which I had fancied nothing could be said against the attacks of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, I now conceived might be maintained without presumption; especially after I had heard one or two parts of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> explained, and often allegorically&mdash; which when I accepted literally, I was <q>killed</q> spiritually.  Many places, then, of those books having been expounded to me, I now blamed my despair in having <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that no reply could be made to those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> and derided  the Law and the Prophets. Yet I did not then see that for that reason the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> way was to be held because it had its learned advocates, who could at length, and not irrationally, answer objections; nor that what I held ought therefore to be condemned because both sides were equally defensible. For that way did not appear to me to be vanquished; nor yet did it seem to me to be victorious.</p>

<p>25. Hereupon did I earnestly bend my mind to see if in any way I could possibly prove the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> guilty of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. Could I have realized a spiritual substance, all their strongholds would have been beaten down, and cast utterly out of my mind; but I could not. But yet, concerning the body of this world, and the whole of nature, which the senses of the flesh can attain unto, I, now more and more considering and comparing things, judged that the greater part of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> held much the more probable opinions. So, then, after the manner of the Academics (as they are supposed),  doubting of everything and fluctuating between all, I decided that the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> were to be abandoned; judging that, even while in that period of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, I could not remain in a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> to which I preferred some of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; to which <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, however, because they were without the saving name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, I utterly refused to commit the cure of my fainting <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. I resolved, therefore, to be a catechumen  in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which my <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> had commended to me, until something settled should manifest itself to me whither I might steer my course. </p>
