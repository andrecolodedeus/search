<h1>The Confessions (Book XIII)</h1>

<p class="h1a">Of the goodness of God explained in the creation of things, and of the Trinity as found in the first words of Genesis. The story concerning the origin of the world (Genesis 1) is allegorically explained, and he applies it to those things which God works for sanctified and blessed man. Finally, he makes an end of this work, having implored eternal rest from God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1. He Calls Upon God, and Proposes to Himself to Worship Him.</h2>

<p>1. I Call upon You, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my mercy, who made me, and who did not forget me, though forgetful of You. I call You into  my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which by the desire which Thou inspirest in it Thou preparest for Your reception. Do not Thou forsake me calling upon You, who anticipated me before I called, and importunately urged with manifold calls that I should hear You from afar, and be converted, and call upon You who called me. For Thou, O Lord, have blotted out all my <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deserts, that You might not repay into my hands wherewith I have fallen from You, and You have anticipated all my good deserts, that You might repay into Your hands wherewith You made me; because before I was, You were, nor was I [anything] to which You might grant being. And yet behold, I am, out of Your goodness, anticipating all this which You have made me, and of which You have made me. For neither had Thou stood in need of me, nor am I such a good as to be helpful unto You,  my Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not that I may so serve You as though You were fatigued in working, or lest Your power may be less if lacking my assistance nor that, like the land, I may so cultivate You that You would be uncultivated did I cultivate You not but that I may serve and worship You, to the end that I may have well-being from You; from whom it is that I am one susceptible of well-being.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. All Creatures Subsist from the Plenitude of Divine Goodness.</h2>

<p>2. For of the plenitude of Your goodness Your creature subsists, that a good, which could profit You nothing, nor though of You was equal to You, might yet be, since it could be made of You. For what did heaven and earth, which You made in the beginning, deserve of You? Let those spiritual and corporeal natures, which Thou in Your wisdom made, declare what they deserve of You to depend thereon&mdash;even the inchoate and formless, each in its own kind, either spiritual or corporeal, going into excess, and into remote unlikeness unto You (the spiritual, though formless, more excellent than if it were a formed body; and the corporeal, though formless, more excellent than if it were altogether nothing), and thus they as formless would depend upon Your Word, unless by the same Word they were recalled to Your Unity, and endued with form, and from You, the one sovereign Good, were all made very good. How have they deserved of You, that they should be even formless, since they would not be even this except from You?</p>

<p>3. How has corporeal matter deserved of You, to be even invisible and formless, <span class="stiki" id="note111170"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;1:2</a></span> since it were not even this had Thou not made it; and therefore since it was not, it could not deserve of You that it should be made? Or how could the inchoate spiritual creature  deserve of You, that even it should flow darksomely like the deep&mdash;unlike You, had it not been by the same Word turned to that by Whom it was created, and by Him so enlightened become light, although not equally, yet conformably to that Form which is equal unto You? For as to a body, to be is not all one with being beautiful, for then it could not be deformed; so also to a created spirit, to live is not all one with living wisely, for then it would be wise unchangeably. But it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>  for it always to hold fast unto You,  lest, in turning from You, it lose that light which it has obtained in turning to You, and relapse into a light resembling the darksome deep. For even we ourselves, who in respect of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are a spiritual creature, having turned away from You, our light, were in that life <q>sometimes darkness;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111174"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> and do labour amidst the remains of our darkness, until in Your Only One we become Your righteousness, like the mountains of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For we have been Your judgments, which are like the great deep. </p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Genesis I. 3&mdash;Of <q>Light,</q>&mdash; He Understands as It is Seen in the Spiritual Creature.</h2>

<p>4. But what Thou said in the beginning of the creation, <q>Let there be light, and there was light,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111176"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;1:3</a></span> I do not unfitly understand of the spiritual creature; because there was even then a kind of life, which You might illuminate. But as it had not deserved of You that it should be such a life as could be enlightened, so neither, when it already was, has it deserved of You that it should be enlightened. For neither could its formlessness be pleasing unto You, unless it became light&mdash;not by merely existing, but by beholding the illuminating light, and cleaving unto it; so also, that it lives, and lives happily,  it owes to nothing whatsoever but to Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; being converted by means of a better change unto that which can be changed neither into better nor into worse; the which Thou only art because Thou only simply art, to whom it is not one thing to live, another to live blessedly, since You are Yourself Your own Blessedness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. All Things Have Been Created by the Grace of God, and are Not of Him as Standing in Need of Created Things.</h2>

<p>5. What, therefore, could there be wanting unto Your good, which You Yourself art, although these things had either never been, or had remained formless&mdash;the which You made not out of any want, but out of the plenitude of Your goodness, restraining them and converting them to form not as though Your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> were perfected by them? For to You, being perfect, their imperfection is displeasing, and therefore were they perfected by You, and were pleasing unto You; but not as if You were imperfect, and were to be perfected in their perfection. For Your good Spirit was borne over the waters, <span class="stiki" id="note111178"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;1:2</a></span> not borne up by them as if He rested upon them. For those in whom Your good Spirit is said to rest, <span class="stiki" id="note111179"><a href="../bible/num011.htm#verse25">Numbers&nbsp;11:25</a></span> He causes to rest in Himself. But Your incorruptible and unchangeable will, which in itself is all-sufficient for itself, was borne over that life which You had made, to which to live is not all one with living happily, since, flowing in its own darkness, it lives also; for which it remains to be converted unto Him by whom it was made, and to live more and more by <q>the fountain of life,</q> and in His light to <q>see light,</q>  and to be perfected, and enlightened, and made <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. He Recognises the Trinity in the First Two Verses of Genesis.</h2>

<p>6. Behold now, the Trinity appears unto me in an enigma, which Thou, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, art, since Thou, O Father, in the Beginning of our wisdom&mdash;Which is Your Wisdom, born of Yourself, equal and co-eternal unto You&mdash;that is, in Your Son, hast created heaven and earth. Many things have we said of the heaven of heavens, and of the earth invisible and formless, and of the darksome deep, in reference to the wandering defects of its spiritual deformity, were it not converted unto Him from whom was its life, such as it was, and by His enlightening became a beauteous life, and the heaven of that heaven which was afterwards set between water and water. And under the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I now held the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who made these things; and under the name of the Beginning,  the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom He made these things; and believing, as I did, that my God was the Trinity, I sought further in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> words, and behold, Your Spirit was borne over the waters. Behold the Trinity, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>&mdash;the Creator of all creation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Why the Holy Ghost Should Have Been Mentioned After the Mention of Heaven and Earth.</h2>

<p>7. But what was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, O Thou true-speaking Light? Unto You do I lift up my heart, let it not teach me vain things; disperse its darkness, and tell me, I beseech You, by our mother charity, tell me, I beseech You, the reason why, after the mention of heaven, and of the earth invisible and formless, and darkness upon the deep, Your Scripture should then at length mention Your Spirit? Was it because it was meet that it should be spoken of Him that He was <q>borne over,</q> and this could not be said, unless that were first mentioned <q>over</q> which Your Spirit may be understood to have been <q>borne?</q> For neither was He <q>borne over</q> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, nor could it rightly be said that He was <q>borne over</q> if He were <q>borne over</q> nothing. That, therefore, was first to be spoken of <q>over</q> which He might be <q>borne;</q> and then He, whom it was not meet to mention otherwise than as having been <q>borne.</q> Why, then, was it not meet that it should otherwise be mentioned of Him, than as having been <q>borne over?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 7. That the Holy Spirit Brings Us to God.</h2>

<p>8. Hence let him that is able now follow Your apostle with his understanding where he thus speaks, because Your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <q>is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which is given unto us;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111182"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> and where, <q>concerning spiritual gifts,</q> he teaches and shows unto us a more excellent way of charity;  and where he bows his knees unto You for us, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the super-eminent <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note111184"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse14">Ephesians&nbsp;3:14-19</a></span> And, therefore, from the beginning was He super-eminently <q>borne above the waters.</q> To whom shall I tell this? How speak of the weight of lustful desires, pressing downwards to the steep abyss? And how charity raises us up again, through Your Spirit which was <q>borne over the waters?</q> To whom shall I tell it? How tell it? For neither are there places in which we are merged and emerge.  What can be more like, and yet more unlike? They be affections, they be loves; the filthiness of our spirit flowing away downwards with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of cares, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of Yours raising us upwards by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of freedom from care; that we may lift our hearts  unto You where Your Spirit is <q>borne over the waters;</q> and that we may come to that pre-eminent rest, when our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall have passed through the waters which have no substance. </p>

<h2>Chapter 8. That Nothing Whatever, Short of God, Can Yield to the Rational Creature a Happy Rest.</h2>

<p>9. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> fell, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man fell  and they have thus indicated the abyss in that dark deep, ready for the whole spiritual creation, unless You had said from the beginning, <q>Let there be light,</q> and there had been light, and every <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> intelligence of Your celestial City had cleaved to You, and rested in Your Spirit, which unchangeably is <q>borne over</q> everything changeable. Otherwise, even the heaven of heavens itself would have been a darksome deep, whereas now it is light in the Lord. For even in that wretched restlessness of the spirits who fell away, and, when unclothed of the garments of Your light, discovered their own darkness, dost Thou sufficiently disclose how noble You have made the rational creature; to which nought which is inferior to You will suffice to yield a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> rest,  and so not even herself. For Thou, O our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall enlighten our darkness;  from You are derived our garments of light,  and then shall our darkness be as the noonday.  Give Yourself unto me, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, restore Yourself unto me; behold, I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> You, and if it be too little, let me <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> You more strongly. I cannot measure my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, so that I may come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how much there is yet wanting in me, ere my life run into Your embracements, and not be turned away until it be hidden in the secret place of Your Presence.  This only I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that woe is me except in You&mdash;not only without, but even also within myself; and all plenty which is not my God is poverty to me. </p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Why the Holy Spirit Was Only <q>Borne Over</q> The Waters.</h2>

<p>10. But was not either the Father or the Son <q>borne over the waters?</q> If we understand this to mean in space, as a body, then neither was the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; but if the incommutable super-eminence of Divinity above everything mutable, then both Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost were borne <q>over the waters.</q> Why, then, is this said of Your Spirit only? Why is it said of Him alone? As if He had been in place who is not in place, of whom only it is written, that He is Your gift?  In Your gift we rest; there we enjoy You. Our rest is our place. Love lifts us up there, and Your good Spirit lifts our lowliness from the gates of death.  In Your good pleasure lies our peace.  The body by its own weight gravitates towards its own place. Weight goes not downward only, but to its own place. Fire tends upwards, a stone downwards. They are propelled by their own weights, they seek their own places. Oil poured under the water is raised above the water; water poured upon oil sinks under the oil. They are propelled by their own weights, they seek their own places. Out of order, they are restless; restored to order, they are at rest. My weight is my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>;  by it am I borne wherever I am borne. By Your Gift we are inflamed, and are borne upwards; we wax hot inwardly, and go forwards. We ascend Your ways that be in our heart,  and sing a song of degrees; we glow inwardly with Your fire, with Your good fire, and we go, because we go upwards to the peace of Jerusalem; for glad was I when they said unto me, <q>Let us go into the house of the Lord.</q>  There has Your good pleasure placed us, that we may desire no other thing than to dwell there for ever.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. That Nothing Arose Save by the Gift of God.</h2>

<p>11. Happy creature, which, though in itself it was other than You, has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> no other state than that as soon as it was made, it was, without any interval of time, by Your Gift, which is borne over everything mutable, raised up by that calling whereby Thou said, <q>Let there be light, and there was light.</q> Whereas in us there is a difference of times, in that we were darkness, and are made light; <span class="stiki" id="note111201"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> but of that it is only said what it would have been had it not been enlightened. And this is so spoken as if it had been fleeting and darksome before; that so the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whereby it was made to be otherwise might appear&mdash;that is to say, being turned to the unfailing Light it might become light. Let him who is able understand this; and let him who is not,  ask of You. Why should he trouble me, as if I could enlighten any <q>man that comes into the world?</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 11. That the Symbols of the Trinity in Man, to Be, to Know, and to Will, are Never Thoroughly Examined.</h2>

<p>12. Which of us understands the Almighty Trinity?  And yet which speaks not of It, if indeed it be It? Rare is that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which, while it speaks of It, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what it speaks of. And they contend and strive, but no one without peace sees that vision. I could wish that men would consider these three things that are in themselves. These three are far other than the Trinity; but I speak of things in which they may exercise and prove themselves, and feel how far other they be.  But the three things I speak of are, To Be, to Know, and to Will. For I Am, and I Know, and I Will; I Am <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> and Willing; and I Know myself to Be and to Will; and I Will to Be and to Know. In these three, therefore, let him who can see how inseparable a life there is&mdash;even one life, one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; finally, how inseparable is the distinction, and yet a distinction. Surely a man has it before him; let him look into himself, and see, and tell me. But when he discovers and can say anything of these, let him not then think that he has discovered that which is above these Unchangeable, which Is unchangeably, and Knows unchangeably, and Wills unchangeably. And whether on account of these three there is also, where they are, a Trinity; or whether these three be in Each, so that the three belong to Each; or whether both ways at once, wondrously, simply, and vet diversely, in Itself a limit unto Itself, yet illimitable; whereby It is, and is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto Itself, and suffices to Itself, unchangeably the Self-same, by the abundant magnitude of its Unity,&mdash; who can readily conceive? Who in any wise express it? Who in any way rashly pronounce thereon?</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Allegorical Explanation of Genesis, Chap. I., Concerning the Origin of the Church and Its Worship.</h2>

<p>13. Proceed in your confession, say to the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, O my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, Holy, Holy, Holy, O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Your name have we been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in Your name do we <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note111206"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> because among us also in His Christ did God make heaven and earth, namely, the spiritual and carnal people of His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  Yea, and our earth, before it received the <q>form of doctrine,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111208"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;6:17</a></span> was invisible and formless, and we were covered with the darkness of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. For Thou correctest man for iniquity,  and <q>Your judgments are a great deep.</q>  But because Your Spirit was <q>borne over the waters,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111211"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;1:3</a></span> Your mercy forsook not our misery,  and Thou said, <q>Let there be light,</q> <q>Repent, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is at hand.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111213"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;3:2</a></span> Repent, let there be light.  And because our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was troubled within us,  we remembered You, O Lord, from the land of Jordan, and that mountain  equal unto Yourself, but little for our sakes; and upon our being displeased with our darkness, we turned unto You, <q>and there was light.</q> And, behold, we were sometimes darkness, but now light in the Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note111217"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 14. That Out of the Children of the Night and of the Darkness, Children of the Light and of the Day are Made.</h2>

<p>15. And so say I too, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where are You? Behold where You are! In You I breathe a little, when I pour out my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by myself in the voice of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and praise, the sound of him that keeps holy-day.  And yet it is <q>cast down,</q> because it relapses and becomes a deep, or rather it feels that it is still a deep. Unto it does my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> speak which You have kindled to enlighten my feet in the night, <q>Why art you cast down, O my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? And why are you disquieted in me? hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q>  His <q>word is a lamp unto my feet.</q>  Hope and endure until the night&mdash;the mother of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>&mdash;until the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of the Lord be overpast, <span class="stiki" id="note111244"><a href="../bible/job014.htm#verse13">Job&nbsp;14:13</a></span> whereof we also were once children who were sometimes darkness,  the remains whereof we carry about us in our body, dead on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note111246"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;8:10</a></span> <q>until the day break and the shadows flee away.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111247"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse17">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:17</a></span> <q>Hope in the Lord.</q> In the morning I shall stand in Your presence, and contemplate You;  I shall for ever confess unto You.

<h2>Chapter 15. Allegorical Explanation of the Firmament and Upper Works, Ver. 6.</h2>

<p>16. Or who but Thou, our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, made for us that firmament <span class="stiki" id="note111260"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;1:6</a></span> of authority over us in Your <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>?  As it is said, For heaven shall be folded up like a scroll;  and now it is extended over us like a skin.  For Your <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> is of more sublime authority, since those mortals through whom You dispensed it unto us underwent mortality. And You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O Lord, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, how Thou with skins clothed men  when by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> they became mortal. Whence as a skin have You stretched out the firmament of Your Book;  that is to say, Your harmonious words, which by the ministry of mortals You have spread over us. For by their very death is that solid firmament of authority in Your discourses set forth by them more sublimely extended above all things that are under it, the which, while they were living here, was not so eminently extended.  You had not as yet spread abroad the heaven like a skin; You had not as yet noised everywhere the report of their deaths.</p>

<p>17. Let us look, O Lord, <q>upon the heavens, the work of Your fingers;</q>  clear from our eyes that mist with which You have covered them. There is that testimony of Yours which gives wisdom unto the little ones.  Perfect, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Your praise out of the mouth of babes and sucklings.  Nor have we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> any other books so destructive to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, so destructive to the enemy and the defender,  who resists Your reconciliation in defence of his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.  I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, O Lord, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not other such <q>pure</q>  words which so persuade me to confession, and make my neck submissive to Your yoke, and invite me to serve You for nought. Let me understand these things, good Father. Grant this to me, placed under them; because You have established these things for those placed under them.</p> 

<p>18. Other <q>waters</q> there be <q>above</q> this <q>firmament,</q> I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and removed from earthly corruption. Let them praise Your Name&mdash;those super-celestial people, Your <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who have no need to look up at this firmament, or by reading to attain the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Your Word,&mdash; let them praise You. For they always behold Your face, <span class="stiki" id="note111273"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;18:10</a></span> and therein read without any syllables in time what Your <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> will wills. They read, they choose, they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.  They are always reading; and that which they read never passes away. For, by choosing and by loving, they read the very unchangeableness of Your counsel. Their book is not closed, nor is the scroll folded up, <span class="stiki" id="note111275"><a href="../bible/isa034.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;34:4</a></span> because You Yourself art this to them, yea, and art so <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>; because You have appointed them above this firmament, which You have made firm over the weakness of the lower people, where they might look up and learn Your mercy, announcing in time You who hast made times. <q>For Your mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens, and Your faithfulness reaches unto the clouds.</q>  The clouds pass away, but the heaven remains. The preachers of Your Word pass away from this life into another; but Your Scripture is spread abroad over the people, even to the end of the world. Yea, both heaven and earth shall pass away, but Your Words shall not pass away. <span class="stiki" id="note111277"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse35">Matthew&nbsp;24:35</a></span> Because the scroll shall be rolled together, <span class="stiki" id="note111278"><a href="../bible/isa034.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;34:4</a></span> and the grass over which it was spread shall with its goodliness pass away; but Your Word remains for ever,  which now appears unto us in the dark image of the clouds, and through the glass of the heavens, not as it is; <span class="stiki" id="note111280"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:12</a></span> because we also, although we be the well-beloved of Your Son, yet it has not yet appeared what we shall be. <span class="stiki" id="note111281"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:2</a></span> He looks through the lattice <span class="stiki" id="note111282"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse9">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:9</a></span> of our flesh, and He is fair-speaking, and has inflamed us, and we run after His odours. <span class="stiki" id="note111283"><a href="../bible/son001.htm#verse3">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;1:3</a></span> But <q>when He shall appear, then shall we be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111284"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:2</a></span> As He is, O Lord, shall we see Him, although the time be not yet.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. That No One But the Unchangeable Light Knows Himself.</h2>

<p>19. For altogether as You are, Thou only <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a>, Who art unchangeably, and <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> unchangeably, and willest unchangeably. And Your Essence Knows and Wills unchangeably; and Your Knowledge Is, and Wills unchangeably; and Your Will Is, and Knows unchangeably. Nor does it appear just to You, that as the Unchangeable Light <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Itself, so should It be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by that which is enlightened and changeable.  Therefore unto You is my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as <q>land where no water is,</q>  because as it cannot of itself enlighten itself, so it cannot of itself satisfy itself. For so is the fountain of life with You, like as in Your light we shall see light. </p>

<h2>Chapter 17. Allegorical Explanation of the Sea and the Fruit-Bearing Earth&mdash; Verses 9 and 11.</h2>

<p>20. Who has gathered the embittered together into one society? For they have all the same end, that of temporal and earthly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, on account of which they do all things, although they may fluctuate with an innumerable variety of cares. Who, O Lord, unless Thou, said, Let the waters be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear,  which <q>thirsts after You</q>?  For the sea also is Yours, and You have made it, and Your hands prepared the dry land.  For neither is the bitterness of men's wills, but the gathering together of waters called sea; for Thou even curbest the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> desires of men's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and fixest their bounds, how far they may be permitted to advance,  and that their waves may be broken against each other; and thus dost Thou make it a sea, by the order of Your dominion over all things.</p>

<p>21. But as for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that thirst after You, and that appear before You (being by other bounds divided from the society of the sea), them Thou waterest by a secret and sweet spring, that the earth may bring forth her fruit,  and, You, O Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so commanding, our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may bud forth works of mercy according to their kind, &mdash; loving our neighbour in the relief of his bodily necessities, having seed in itself according to its likeness, when from our infirmity we compassionate even to the relieving of the needy; helping them in a like manner as we would that help should be brought unto us if we were in a like need; not only in the things that are easy, as in <q>herb yielding seed,</q> but also in the protection of our assistance, in our very strength, like the tree yielding fruit; that is, a good turn in delivering him who suffers an injury from the hand of the powerful, and in furnishing him with the shelter of protection by the mighty strength of just judgment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. Of the Lights and Stars of Heaven&mdash; Of Day and Night, Ver. 14.</h2>

<p>22. Thus, O Lord, thus, I beseech You, let there arise, as You make, as You give <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and ability&mdash;let <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> spring out of the earth, and righteousness look down from heaven,</q> and let there be <q>lights in the firmament.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111294"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;1:14</a></span> Let us break our bread to the hungry, and let us bring the houseless poor to our house. <span class="stiki" id="note111295"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;58:7</a></span> Let us clothe the naked, and despise not those of our own flesh.

For therein You make it plain unto us, that we may distinguish between things intelligible and things of sense, as if between the day and the night; or between <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, given, some to things intellectual, others to things of sense; so that now not Thou only in the secret of Your judgment, as before the firmament was made, dividest between the light and the darkness, but Your spiritual children also, placed and ranked in the same firmament (Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> being manifest throughout the world), may give light upon the earth, and divide between the day and night, and be for signs of times; because <q>old things have passed away,</q> and <q>behold all things have become new;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111299"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> and <q>because our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is nearer than when we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111300"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;13:11-12</a></span> and because <q>the night is far spent, the day is at hand;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111301"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;13:11-12</a></span> and because You will crown Your year with blessing,  sending the labourers of Your goodness into Your harvest, <span class="stiki" id="note111303"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;9:38</a></span> in the sowing of which others have laboured, sending also into another field, whose harvest shall be in the end. <span class="stiki" id="note111304"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;13:39</a></span> Thus Thou grantest the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of him that asks, and blessest the years of the just; <span class="stiki" id="note111305"><a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse6">Proverbs&nbsp;10:6</a></span> but You are the same, and in Your years which fail not  Thou preparest a garner for our passing years. For by an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> counsel Thou dost in their proper seasons bestow upon the earth heavenly blessings.</p>

<p>23. For, indeed, to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, as if the greater light, on account of those who are delighted with the light of manifest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as in the beginning of the day; but to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by the same Spirit, as if the lesser light;  to another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; to another the gift of healing; to another the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; to another <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; to another the discerning of spirits; to another various kinds of tongues. And all these as stars. For all these works the one and self-same Spirit, dividing to every man his own as He wills; <span class="stiki" id="note111308"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:8-11</a></span> and making stars appear manifestly, to profit withal. <span class="stiki" id="note111309"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:7</a></span> But the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, wherein are contained all <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>,  which are varied in their periods like the moon, and the other conceptions of gifts, which are successively reckoned up as stars, inasmuch as they come short of that splendour of wisdom in which the fore-mentioned day rejoices, are only for the beginning of the night. For they are necessary to such as he Your most <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> servant could not speak unto as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal <span class="stiki" id="note111311"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:1</a></span> &mdash; even he who speaks wisdom among those that are perfect. <span class="stiki" id="note111312"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:6</a></span> But the natural man, as a babe in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>&mdash;and a drinker of milk&mdash;until he be strengthened for solid meat,  and his eye be enabled to look upon the Sun,  let him not dwell in his own deserted night, but let him be contented with the light of the moon and the stars. Thou reasonest these things with us, our All-wise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Your Book, Your firmament, that we may discern all things in an admirable <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, although as yet in signs, and in times, and in days, and in years.</p>

And among these things, many great works of wonder have been wrought, like as great whales; and the voices of Your messengers flying above the earth, near to the firmament of Your Book; that being set over them as an authority, under which they were to fly wherever they were to go. For <q>there is no speech, nor language, where their voice is not heard;</q> seeing their sound  <q>has gone through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world,</q> because Thou, O Lord, hast multiplied these things by blessing. <span class="stiki" id="note111341"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;1:4</a></span> </p>

For of those things whereof the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is solid and defined, without increase by generation, as it were lights of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, yet of these self-same things the material operations are many and varied; and one thing in growing from another is multiplied by Your blessing, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who hast refreshed the fastidiousness of mortal senses; so that in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, one thing may, through the motions of the body, be in many ways  set out and expressed.

<p>28. Now all things are fair that You have made, but behold, You are inexpressibly fairer who hast made all things; from whom had not <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> fallen, the saltness of the sea would never have flowed from him&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> so profoundly curious, and boisterously swelling, and restlessly moving; and thus there would be no need that Your dispensers should work in many waters,  in a corporeal and sensible manner, <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> doings and sayings.

For thus do men hear not with an intent to hear merely, but to act also. Seek the Lord, and your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall live,  that the earth may bring forth the living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <q>Be not conformed to this world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111357"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;12:2</a></span> Restrain yourselves from it; the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> lives by avoiding those things which it dies by affecting.

The vocal pronunciation of all which words is caused by the deep of this world, and the blindness of the flesh, by which thoughts cannot be seen, so that it is necessary to speak aloud in the ears; thus, although flying fowls be multiplied upon the earth, yet they derive their beginning from the waters. The spiritual man judges also by approving what is right and reproving what he finds amiss in the works and morals of the faithful, in their <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, as if in <q>the earth bringing forth fruit;</q> and he judges of the <q>living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,</q> rendered living by softened affections, in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> thoughts; and of those things which are perceived through the senses of the body.

Behold, Thou blessest men, O Lord, that they may <q>be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111389"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> in this dost Thou not make a sign unto us that we may understand something? Why have You not also blessed the light, which You called day, nor the firmament of heaven, nor the lights, nor the stars, nor the earth, nor the sea? I might say, O our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that Thou, who hast created us after Your Image,&mdash; I might say, that You have willed to bestow this gift of blessing especially upon man, had Thou not in like manner blessed the fishes and the whales, that they should be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the waters of the sea, and that the fowls should be multiplied upon the earth. Likewise might I say, that this blessing belonged properly unto such creatures as are propagated from their own kind, if I had found it in the shrubs, and the fruit trees, and beasts of the earth. But now is it not said either unto the herbs, or trees, or beasts, or serpents, <q>Be fruitful and multiply;</q> since all these also, as well as fishes, and fowls, and men, do by propagation increase and preserve their kind.</p>

<p>36. What, then, shall I say, O Thou Truth, my Light&mdash;<q>that it was idly and vainly said?</q> Not so, O Father of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; far be it from a minister of Your word to say this. But if I understand not what Thou meanest by that phrase, let my betters&mdash; that is, those more intelligent than I&mdash; use it better, in proportion as Thou, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hast given to each to understand. But let my confession be also pleasing before Your eyes, in which I confess to You that I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, O Lord, that You have not thus spoken in vain; nor will I be silent as to what this lesson suggests to me. For it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, nor do I see what should prevent me from thus understanding the figurative sayings  of Your books. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a thing may be manifoldly signified by bodily expression which is understood in one manner by the mind; and that that may be manifoldly understood in the mind which is in one manner signified by bodily expression. Behold, the single <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of our neighbour, by what manifold <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and innumerable languages, and in each several language in how innumerable modes of speaking, it is bodily expressed. Thus do the young of the waters increase and multiply. Observe again, whosoever you are who readest; behold what Scripture delivers, and the voice pronounces in one only way, <q>In the beginning God created heaven and earth;</q> is it not manifoldly understood, not by any deceit of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but by various kinds of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> senses?  Thus are the offspring of men <q>fruitful</q> and do <q>multiply.</q></p>

<p>37. If, therefore, we conceive of the natures of things, not allegorically, but properly, then does the phrase, <q>be fruitful and multiply,</q> correspond to all things which are begotten of seed. But if we treat those words as taken figuratively (the which I rather suppose the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> intended, which does not, verily, superfluously attribute this benediction to the offspring of marine animals and man only), then do we find that <q>multitude</q> belongs also to creatures both spiritual and corporeal, as in heaven and in earth; and to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> both righteous and unrighteous, as in light and darkness; and to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> authors, through whom the law has been furnished unto us, as in the firmament  which has been firmly placed between waters and waters; and to the society of people yet endued with bitterness, as in the sea; and to the desire of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, as in the dry land; and to works of mercy pertaining to this present life, as in the seed-bearing herbs and fruit-bearing trees; and to spiritual gifts shining forth for edification, as in the lights of heaven; and to affections formed unto <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, as in the living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. In all these cases we meet with multitudes, abundance, and increase; but what shall thus <q>be fruitful and multiply,</q> that one thing may be expressed in many ways, and one expression understood in many ways, we discover not, unless in signs corporeally expressed, and in things mentally conceived. We understand the signs corporeally pronounced as the generations of the waters, necessarily occasioned by carnal depth; but things mentally conceived we understand as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generations, on account of the fruitfulness of reason. And therefore do we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that to each kind of these it has been said by You, O Lord, <q>Be fruitful and multiply.</q> For in this blessing I acknowledge that power and faculty has been granted unto us, by You, both to express in many ways what we understand but in one, and to understand in many ways what we read as obscurely delivered but in one. Thus are the waters of the sea replenished, which are not moved but by various significations; thus even with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> offspring is the earth also replenished, the dryness  whereof appears in its desire, and reason rules over it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25. He Explains the Fruits of the Earth (Ver. 29) of Works of Mercy.</h2>

<p>38. I would also say, O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what the following Scripture reminds me of; yea, I will say it without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For I will speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, Thou inspiring me as to what You will that I should say out of these words. For by none other than Your inspiration do I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that I can speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since You are the Truth, but every man a liar.  And therefore he that <q>speaks a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, he speaks of his own;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111395"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> therefore that I may speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I will speak of Yours. Behold, You have given unto us for food <q>every herb bearing seed,</q> which is upon the face of all the earth, <q>and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111396"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse29">Genesis&nbsp;1:29</a></span> Nor to us only, but to all the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the earth, and to all creeping things;  but unto the fishes, and great whales, You have not given these things. Now we were saying, that by these fruits of the earth works of mercy were signified and figured in an allegory, the which are provided for the necessities of this life out of the fruitful earth. Such an earth was the godly Onesiphorus, unto whose house You gave mercy, because he frequently refreshed Your <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and was not ashamed of his chain. <span class="stiki" id="note111398"><a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:16</a></span> This did also the brethren, and such fruit did they bear, who out of Macedonia supplied what was wanting unto him. <span class="stiki" id="note111399"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:9</a></span> But how does he grieve for certain trees, which did not afford him the fruit due unto him, when he says, <q>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> forsook me: I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> God that it may not be laid to their charge.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111400"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:16</a></span> For these fruits are due to those who minister spiritual  doctrine, through their understanding of the divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>; and they are due to them as men. They are due to them, too, as to the living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, supplying itself as an example in all continency; and due unto them likewise as flying creatures, for their blessings which are multiplied upon the earth, since their sound went out into all lands. </p>

<h2>Chapter 26. In the Confessing of Benefits, Computation is Made Not as to The <q>Gift,</q> But as to the <q>Fruit,</q>&mdash; That Is, the Good and Right Will of the Giver.</h2>

<p>39. But they who are delighted with them are fed by those fruits; nor are they delighted with them <q>whose god is their belly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111403"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse19">Philippians&nbsp;3:19</a></span> For neither in those that yield them are the things given the fruit, but in what spirit they give them. Therefore he who serves God and not his own belly, <span class="stiki" id="note111404"><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;16:18</a></span> I plainly see why he may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>; I see it, and I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with him exceedingly. For he has received from the Philippians those things which they had sent from Epaphroditus; <span class="stiki" id="note111405"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse18">Philippians&nbsp;4:18</a></span> but yet I see why he rejoiced. For whereat he rejoices, upon that he feeds; for speaking in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <q>I rejoiced,</q> says he, <q>in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again, wherein you were also careful,</q>  but it had become wearisome unto you. These Philippians, then, by protracted wearisomeness, had become enfeebled, and as it were dried up, as to bringing forth this fruit of a good work; and he rejoices for them, because they flourished again, not for himself, because they ministered to his wants. Therefore, adds he, <q>not that I speak in respect of want, for I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both how to be abased, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to abound everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.</q> </p>

<p>40. Whereat, then, do you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in all things, O great <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? Whereat do you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>? Whereon do you feed, O man, renewed  in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, after the image of Him that created you, you living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of so great continency, and you tongue like flying fowls, speaking <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>&mdash;for to such creatures is this food due&mdash;what is that which feeds you? Joy. Let us hear what follows. <q>Notwithstanding,</q> says he, <q>you have well done that you did communicate with My affliction.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111408"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse14">Philippians&nbsp;4:14</a></span> Hereat does he <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, hereon does he feed; because they have well done,  not because his strait was relieved, who says unto you, <q>You have enlarged me when I was in distress;</q>  because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> both <q>to abound and to suffer need,</q>  in You Who strengthenest him. For, says he, <q>you Philippians <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no Church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only. For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again unto my necessity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111412"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;4:15-16</a></span> Unto these good works he now rejoices that they have returned; and is made glad that they flourished again, as when a fruitful field recovers its greenness.</p>

<p>41. Was it on account of his own necessities that he said, You have sent unto my necessity? Rejoices he for that? Verily not for that. But whence <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> we this? Because he himself continues, <q>Not because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit.</q>  From You, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have I learned to distinguish between a <q>gift</q> and <q>fruit.</q> A gift is the thing itself which he gives who bestows these necessaries, as money, food, drink, clothing, shelter, aid; but the fruit is the good and right will of the giver. For the good Master says not only, <q>He that receives a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>,</q> but adds, <q>in the name of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</q> Nor says He only, <q>He that receives a righteous man,</q> but adds, <q>in the name of a righteous man.</q> So, verily, the former shall receive the reward of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, the latter that of a righteous man. Nor says He only, <q>Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water,</q> but adds, <q>in the name of a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a></q> and so concludes, <q>Verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111414"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;10:41-42</a></span> The gift is to receive a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, to receive a righteous man, to hand a cup of cold water to a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>; but the fruit is to do this in the name of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, in the name of a righteous man, in the name of a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. With fruit was Elijah fed by the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that she fed a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and on this account fed him; but by the raven was he fed with a gift. Nor was the inner man  of Elijah fed, but the outer only, which might also from want of such food have perished.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27. Many are Ignorant as to This, and Ask for Miracles, Which are Signified Under the Names Of <q>Fishes</q> And <q>Whales.</q></h2>

<p>42. Therefore will I speak before You, O Lord, what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, when <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> men and infidels (for the initiating and gaining of whom the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of initiation and great works of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are necessary,  which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be signified under the name of <q>fishes</q> and <q>whales</q>) undertake that Your servants should be bodily refreshed, or should be otherwise succoured for this present life, although they may be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> wherefore this is to be done, and to what end; neither do the former feed the latter, nor the latter the former; for neither do the one perform these things through a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and right intent, nor do the other <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the gifts of those who behold not as yet the fruit. For on that is the mind fed wherein it is gladdened. And, therefore, fishes and whales are not fed on such food as the earth brings not forth until it had been separated and divided from the bitterness of the waters of the sea.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28. He Proceeds to the Last Verse, <q>All Things are Very Good,</q>&mdash; That Is, the Work Being Altogether Good.</h2>

<p>43. And You, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saw everything that You had made, and behold it was very good. <span class="stiki" id="note111417"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse31">Genesis&nbsp;1:31</a></span> So we also see the same, and behold all are very good. In each particular kind of Your works, when You had said, <q>Let them be made,</q> and they were made, Thou saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Seven times have I counted it written that Thou saw that that which You made was <q>good;</q> and this is the eighth, that Thou saw all things that You had made, and behold they are not only good, but also <q>very good,</q> as being now taken together. For individually they were only good, but all taken together they were both good and very good. All beautiful bodies also express this; for a body which consists of members, all of which are beautiful, is by far more beautiful than the several members individually are by whose well-ordered union the whole is completed, though these members also be severally beautiful. </p>

<h2>Chapter 29. Although It is Said Eight Times that <q>God Saw that It Was Good,</q> Yet Time Has No Relation to God and His Word.</h2>

<p>44. And I looked attentively to find whether seven or eight times Thou saw that Your works were good, when they were pleasing unto You; but in Your seeing I found no times, by which I might understand that you saw so often what You made. And I said, <q>O Lord,! Is not this Your Scripture <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, since You are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and being Truth hast set it forth? Why, then, dost Thou say unto me that in your seeing there are no times, while this Your Scripture tells me that what You made each day, Thou saw to be good; and when I counted them I found how often?</q> Unto these things Thou repliest unto me, for You are my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and with strong voice tellest unto Your servant in his inner ear, bursting through my deafness, and crying, <q>O man, that which My <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, I say; and yet does that speak in time; but time has no reference to My Word, because My Word exists in equal <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> with Myself. Thus those things which you see through My Spirit, I see, just as those things which you speak through My Spirit, I speak. And so when you see those things in time, I see them not in time; as when you speak them in time, I speak them not in time.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 30. He Refutes the Opinions of the Manich&aelig;ans and the Gnostics Concerning the Origin of the World.</h2>

<p>45. And I heard, O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and drank up a drop of sweetness from Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and understood that there are certain men to whom Your works are displeasing, who say that many of them You made being compelled by necessity;&mdash; such as the fabric of the heavens and the courses of the stars, and that You made them not of what was Yours, but, that they were elsewhere and from other sources created; that You might bring together and compact and interweave, when from Your conquered enemies You raised up the walls of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, that they, bound down by this structure, might not be able a second time to rebel against You. But, as to other things, they say You neither made them nor compacted them&mdash;such as all flesh and all very minute creatures, and whatsoever holds the earth by its roots; but that a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> hostile unto You and another nature not created by You, and in everywise contrary unto You, did, in these lower places of the world, beget and frame these things.  Infatuated are they who speak thus, since they see not Your works through Your Spirit, nor recognise You in them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31. We Do Not See <q>That It Was Good</q> But Through the Spirit of God Which is in Us.</h2>

<p>46. But as for those who through Your Spirit see these things, You see in them. When therefore, they see that these things are good, You see that they are good; and whatsoever things for Your sake are pleasing, You are pleased in them; and those things which through Your Spirit are pleasing unto us, are pleasing unto You in us. <q>For what man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, save the spirit of a man which is in him? Even so the things of God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no man, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. Now we,</q> says he, <q>have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things that are freely given to us of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111420"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:12</a></span> And I am reminded to say, <q>Truly, 'the things of God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no man, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>;' how, then, do we also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> 'what things are given us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?'?</q> It is answered unto me, <q>Because the things which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by His Spirit, even these '<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no man, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.' For, as it is rightly said unto those who were to speak by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, 'It is not you that speak,' <span class="stiki" id="note111421"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;10:20</a></span> so is it rightly said to them who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, 'It is not ye that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.' None the less, then, is it rightly said to those that see by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, 'It is not ye that see;' so whatever they see by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, it is not they, but God who 'sees that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.'</q> It is one thing, then, for a man to suppose that to be bad which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as the fore-named do; another, that what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> a man should see to be good (as Your creatures are pleasing unto many, because they are good, whom, however, Thou pleasest not in them when they wish to enjoy them rather than enjoy You); and another, that when a man sees a thing to be good, God should in him see that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>&mdash;that in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> He may be loved in that which He made,  who cannot be loved unless by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which He has given. <q>Because the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which is given unto us;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111423"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> by whom we see that whatsoever in any degree is, is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. Because it is from Him who Is not in any degree, but He Is that He Is.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32. Of the Particular Works of God, More Especially of Man.</h2>

<p>47. Thanks to You, O Lord. We behold the heaven and the earth, whether the corporeal part, superior and inferior, or the spiritual and corporeal creature; and in the embellishment of these parts, whereof the universal mass of the world or the universal creation consists, we see light made, and divided from the darkness. We see the firmament of heaven,  whether the primary body of the world between the spiritual upper waters and the corporeal lower waters, or&mdash; because this also is called heaven&mdash; this expanse of air, through which wander the fowls of heaven, between the waters which are in vapours borne above them, and which in clear nights drop down in dew, and those which being heavy flow along the earth. We behold the waters gathered together through the plains of the sea; and the dry land both void and formed, so as to be visible and compact, and the matter of herbs and trees. We behold the lights shining from above&mdash;the sun to serve the day, the moon and the stars to cheer the night; and that by all these, times should be marked and noted. We behold on every side a humid element, fruitful with fishes, beasts, and birds; because the density of the air, which bears up the flights of birds, is increased by the exhalation of the waters.  We behold the face of the earth furnished with terrestrial creatures, and man, created after Your image and likeness, in that very image and likeness of You (that is, the power of reason and understanding) on account of which he was set over all irrational creatures. And as in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there is one power which rules by directing, another made subject that it might <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, so also for the man was corporeally made a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,  who, in the mind of her rational understanding should also have a like nature, in the sex, however, of her body should be in like manner subject to the sex of her husband, as the appetite of action is subjected by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to conceive the skill of acting rightly. These things we behold, and they are severally good, and all very good.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33. The World Was Created by God Out of Nothing.</h2>

<p>48. Let Your works praise You, that we may <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> You; and let us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> You, that Your works may praise You, the which have beginning and end from time,&mdash; rising and setting, growth and decay, form and privation. They have therefore their successions of morning and evening, partly hidden, partly apparent; for they were made from nothing by You, not of You, nor of any matter not Yours, or which was created before, but of concreted matter (that is, matter at the same time created by You), because without any interval of time You formed its formlessness.  For since the matter of heaven and earth is one thing, and the form of heaven and earth another, You have made the matter indeed of almost nothing, but the form of the world You have formed of formless matter; both, however, at the same time, so that the form should follow the matter with no interval of delay.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34. He Briefly Repeats the Allegorical Interpretation of Genesis (Ch. I.), and Confesses that We See It by the Divine Spirit.</h2>

<p>49. We have also examined what You willed to be shadowed forth, whether by the creation, or the description of things in such an order. And we have seen that things severally are good, and all things very good, <span class="stiki" id="note111428"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse31">Genesis&nbsp;1:31</a></span> in Your Word, in Your Only-Begotten, both heaven and earth, the Head and the body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in Your <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> before all times, without morning and evening. But when Thou began to execute in time the things <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a>, that You might make manifest things hidden, and adjust our disorders (for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were over us, and we had sunk into profound darkness away from you, and Your good Spirit was borne over us to help us in due season), Thou both justified the ungodly, <span class="stiki" id="note111429"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;4:5</a></span> and divided them from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; and made firm the authority of Your Book between those above, who would be docile unto You, and those under, who would be subject unto them; and You collected the society of unbelievers into one conspiracy, in order that the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the faithful might appear, and that they might bring forth works of mercy unto You, even distributing unto the poor earthly riches, to obtain heavenly. And after this You kindled certain lights in the firmament, Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ones, having the word of life, and shining with an eminent authority preferred by spiritual gifts; and then again, for the instruction of the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, did You out of corporeal matter produce the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and visible <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and sounds of words according to the firmament of Your Book, by which the faithful should be blessed. Next You formed the living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the faithful, through affections ordered by the vigour of continency; and afterwards, the mind subjected to You alone, and needing to imitate no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> authority,  You renewed after Your image and likeness; and subjected its rational action to the excellency of the understanding, as the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to the man; and to all Your ministries, necessary for the perfecting of the faithful in this life, Thou willed that, for their temporal uses, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, fruitful in the future time, should be given by the same faithful.  We behold all these things, and they are very good, because Thou dost see them in us&mdash; You who has  given unto us Your Spirit, whereby we might see them, and in them <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> You.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35. He Prays God for that Peace of Rest Which Hath No Evening.</h2>

<p>50. O Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, grant Your peace unto us, for You have supplied us with all things&mdash;the peace of rest, the peace of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, which has no evening. For all this most beautiful order of things, <q>very good</q> (all their courses being finished), is to pass away, for in them there was morning and evening.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36. The Seventh Day, Without Evening and Setting, the Image of Eternal Life and Rest in God.</h2>

<p>51. But the seventh day is without any evening, nor has it any setting, because You have sanctified it to an everlasting continuance that that which Thou did after Your works, which were very good, resting on the seventh day, although in unbroken rest You made them that the voice of Your Book may speak beforehand unto us, that we also after our works (therefore very good, because You have given them unto us) may repose in You also in the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 37. Of Rest in God Who Ever Works, and Yet is Ever at Rest.</h2>

<p>52. For even then shall  You so rest in us, as now  You      work in us; and thus shall that be Your rest through us, as these are Your works through us.  But You, O Lord, always work, and are always at rest. Nor do You see in time, nor do You move  in time, nor  do You  in time; and yet You make the scenes of time, and the times themselves, and the rest which results from time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38. Of the Difference Between the Knowledge of God and of Men, and of the Repose Which is to Be Sought from God Only.</h2>

<p>53. We therefore see those things which You made, because they are; but they are because You see them. And we see without that they are, and within that they are good, but You saw them there, when made, where You saw them to be made. And we were at another time moved to do well, after our hearts had conceived of Your Spirit; but in the former time, forsaking You, we were moved to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but  You, the One, the Good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hast never ceased to do good. And we also have certain good works, of Your gift, but not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; after these we hope to rest in Your great hallowing. But You, being the Good, needing no good, art ever at rest, because You Yourself art Your rest. And what man will teach man to understand this? Or what <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>? Or what <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, a man? Let it be asked of You, sought in You, knocked for at You; so, even so shall it be received, so shall it be found, so shall it be opened. <span class="stiki" id="note111433"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;7:7</a></span> <em><a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a></em>.</p>
