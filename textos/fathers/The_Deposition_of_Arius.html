<h1>The Deposition of Arius</h1>


<p> <em>Alexander's Deposition of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and his companions, and Encyclical Letter on the subject.</em></p>

<p>Alexander, being assembled with his beloved brethren, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a> and Deacons of Alexandria, and the Mareotis, greets them in the Lord.</p>

<p>Although you have already subscribed to the letter I addressed to <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and his fellows, exhorting them to renounce his impiety, and to submit themselves to the sound <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith, and have shown your right-mindedness and agreement in the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: yet forasmuch as I have written also to our fellow-ministers in every place concerning <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and his fellows, and especially since some of you, as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a> Chares and Pistus , and the Deacons Serapion, Parammon, Zosimus, and <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>, have joined <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and his fellows, and been content to suffer deposition with them, I thought it needful to assemble together you, the Clergy of the city, and to send for you the Clergy of the Mareotis, in order that you may learn what I am now writing, and may testify your agreement thereto, and give your concurrence in the deposition of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, Pistus, and their fellows. For it is desirable that you should be made acquainted with what I write, and that each of you should heartily embrace it, as though he had written it himself.</p>

<p> <em>A Copy.</em></p>

<p>To his dearly beloved and most honoured fellow-ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in every place, Alexander sends health in the Lord.</p>

<p>1. As there is one body  of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and a command is given us in the sacred Scriptures to preserve the bond of unity and peace, it is agreeable thereto that we should write and signify to one another whatever is done by each of us individually; so that whether one member suffer or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, we may either suffer or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with one another. Now there are gone forth in this diocese, at this time, certain lawless  men, enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, teaching an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, which one may <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> suspect and designate as a forerunner  of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. I was desirous  to pass such a matter by without notice, in the hope that perhaps the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> would spend itself among its supporters, and not extend to other places to defile  the ears  of the simple.  But seeing that Eusebius, now of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, who thinks that the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> rests with him, because retribution has not come upon him for his desertion of Berytus, when he had cast an eye  of desire on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedians</a>, begins to support these <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>, and has taken upon him to write letters every where in their behalf, if by any means he may draw in certain <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to this most base and antichristian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; I am therefore constrained, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what is written in the law, no longer to hold my peace, but to make it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you all; that you may understand who the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> are, and the cavils  which their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> has adopted, and that, should Eusebius write to you, you may pay no attention to him, for he now desires by means of these men to exhibit anew his old malevolence , which has so long been concealed, pretending to write in their favour, while in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it clearly appears, that he does it to forward his own interests.</p>

<p>2. Now those who became <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> are these, <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, Achilles, Aeithales, Carpones, another <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, and Sarmates, sometime <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a>: Euzo&iuml;us, Lucius, Julius, Menas, Helladius, and Gaius, sometime Deacons: and with them Secundus and Theonas, sometime called Bishops. And the novelties they have invented and put forth contrary to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are these following:&mdash; God was not always a Father , but there was a time when God was not a Father. The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> was not always, but originated from things that were not; for God that is, has made him that was not, of that which was not; wherefore there was a time when He was not; for the Son is a creature and a work. Neither is He like in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> to the Father; neither is He the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and natural Word of the Father; neither is He His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Wisdom; but He is one of the things made and created, and is called the Word and Wisdom by an abuse of terms, since He Himself originated by the proper <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and by the Wisdom that is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has made not only all other things but Him also. Wherefore He is by nature subject to change and variation as are all rational creatures. And the Word is foreign from the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>  of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and is alien and separated therefrom. And the Father cannot be described by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, for the Word does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father perfectly and accurately, neither can He see Him perfectly. Moreover, the Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not His own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> as it really is; for He is made for us, that God might create us by Him, as by an instrument; and He would not have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, had not God wished to create us. Accordingly, when some one asked them, whether the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> can possibly change as the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> changed, they were not afraid to say that He can; for being something made and created, His nature is subject to change.</p>

<p>3. Now when <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and his fellows made these assertions, and shamelessly avowed them, we being assembled with the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Libya, nearly a hundred in number, <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> both them and their followers. But Eusebius and his fellows admitted them to communion, being desirous to mingle <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and impiety with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. But they will not be able to do so, for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must prevail; neither is there any <q>communion of light with darkness,</q> nor any <q>concord of Christ with <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>. </q> For who ever heard such assertions before ? Or who that hears them now is not astonished and does not stop his ears lest they should be defiled with such language? Who that has heard the words of John, <q>In the beginning was the Word <span class="stiki" id="note280367"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span>,</q> will not denounce the saying of these men, that <q>there was a time when He was not?</q> Or who that has heard in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>the Only-begotten Son,</q> and <q>by Him were all things made ,</q> will not detest their declaration that He is <q>one of the things that were made.</q> For how can He be one of those things which were made by Himself? Or how can He be the Only-begotten, when, according to them, He is counted as one among the rest, since He is Himself a creature and a work? And how can He be <q>made of things that were not,</q> when the Father says, <q>My heart has uttered a good Word,</q> and <q>Out of the womb I have begotten You before the morning star ?</q> Or again, how is He <q>unlike in substance to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> seeing He is the perfect <q>image</q> and <q>brightness <span class="stiki" id="note280370"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews&nbsp;1:3</a></span> </q> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that He says, <q>He that has seen Me has seen the Father ?</q> And if the Son is the <q>Word</q> and <q>Wisdom</q> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how was there <q>a time when He was not?</q> It is the same as if they should say that God was once without Word and without Wisdom.  And how is He <q>subject to change and variation,</q> Who says, by Himself, <q>I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in Me ,</q> and <q>I and the Father are One ;</q> and by the Prophet, <q>Behold Me, for I am, and I change not ?</q> For although one may refer this expression to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, yet it may now be more aptly spoken of the Word, viz., that though He has been made man, He has not changed; but as the Apostle has said, <q><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is the same yesterday, today, and for ever.</q> And who can have persuaded them to say, that He was made for us, whereas <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> writes, <q>for Whom are all things, and by Whom are all things ?</q></p>

<p>4. As to their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> position that <q>the Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the Father perfectly,</q> we ought not to wonder at it; for having once set themselves to fight against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they contradict even His express words, since He says, <q>As the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Me, even so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I the Father <span class="stiki" id="note280377"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;10:15</a></span> .</q> Now if the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Son but in part, then it is evident that the Son does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Father perfectly; but if it is not lawful to say this, but the Father does <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Son perfectly, then it is evident that as the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> His own Word, so also the Word <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> His own Father Whose Word He is.</p>

<p>5. By these arguments and references to the sacred Scriptures we frequently overthrew them; but they changed like chameleons , and again shifted their ground, striving to bring upon themselves that sentence, <q>when the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> falls into the depth of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, he despises. </q> There have been many <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> before them, which, venturing further than they ought, have fallen into folly; but these men by endeavouring in all their cavils to overthrow the Divinity of the Word, have justified the other in comparison of themselves, as approaching nearer to <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. Wherefore they have been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. We grieve for their destruction, and especially because, having once been instructed in the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they have now sprung away. Yet we are not greatly surprised, for Hymen&aelig;us and Philetus <span class="stiki" id="note280380"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:17</a></span> did the same, and before them Judas, who followed the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, but afterwards became a traitor and an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>. And concerning these same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, we have not been left without instruction; for our Lord has forewarned us; <q>Take heed lest any man deceive you: for many shall come in My name, saying, I am Christ, and the time draws near, and they shall deceive many: go ye not after them <span class="stiki" id="note280381"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;21:8</a></span>;</q> while <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who was taught these things by our Saviour, wrote that <q>in the latter times some shall depart from the sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, which reject the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. </q></p>

<p>6. Since then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a> has instructed us by His own mouth, and also has signified to us by the Apostle concerning such men, we accordingly being personal witnesses of their impiety, have <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>, as we said, all such, and declared them to be alien from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith and Church. And we have made this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, dearly beloved and most honoured fellow-ministers, in order that should any of them have the boldness  to come unto you, you may not receive them, nor comply with the desire of Eusebius, or any other person writing in their behalf. For it becomes us who are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to turn away from all who speak or think any thing against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as being enemies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and destroyers  of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; and not even to <q>bid such God speed <span class="stiki" id="note280385"><a href="../bible/2jo001.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;John&nbsp;10</a></span>,</q> lest we become partakers of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as the blessed John has charged us. Salute the brethren that are with you. They that are with me salute you.</p>
