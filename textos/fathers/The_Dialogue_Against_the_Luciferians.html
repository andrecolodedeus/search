<h1>The Dialogue Against the Luciferians</h1>

<div class="stiki">
<p>This Dialogue was written about 379, seven years after the death of Lucifer, and very soon after Jerome's return from his hermit life in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Chalcis. Though he received ordination from Paulinus, who had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Lucifer, he had no sympathy with Lucifer's narrower views, as he shows plainly in this Dialogue. Lucifer, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Cagliari in Sardinia, first came into prominent notice about a.d. 354, when great efforts were being made to procure a condemnation of S. Athanasius by the Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. He energetically took up the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the saint, and at his own request was sent by Liberius, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, in company with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Pancratius and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Hilarius, on a mission to the Emperor Constantius. The emperor granted a Council, which met at Milan in a.d. 354. Lucifer distinguished himself by resisting a proposition to condemn Athanasius, and did not hesitate to oppose the emperor with much <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. In consequence of this he was sent into exile from a.d. 355 to a.d. 361, the greater portion of which time was spent at <a href="../cathen/05380a.htm">Eleutheropolis</a> in Palestine, though he afterwards removed to the Thebaid. It was at this time that his polemical writings appeared, the tone and temper of which is indicated by the mere titles <em>De Regibus Apostaticis</em> (of Apostate Kings), <em>De non Conveniendo cum H&aelig;reticis, etc</em>. (of not holding communion with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>). On the death of Constantius in 361, Julian permitted the exiled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to return; but Lucifer instead of going to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> where a Council was to be held under the presidency of Athanasius for the healing of a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (some of which held to Meletius, while others followed Eustathius), preferred to go straight to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. There he ordained Paulinus, the leader of the latter section, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Eusebius of Vercell&aelig; soon arrived with the synodal letters of the Council of Alexandria, but, finding himself thus anticipated, and shrinking from a collision with his friend, he retired immediately. Lucifer stayed, and <q>declared that he would not hold communion with Eusebius or any who adopted the moderate policy of the <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> Council. By this Council it had been determined that actual <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, if they renounced their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, should be pardoned, but not invested with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions; and that those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had merely consented to <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> should remain undisturbed. It was this latter concession which offended Lucifer, and he became henceforth the champion of the principle that no one who had yielded to any compromise whatever with <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> should be allowed to hold an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office.</q> He was thus brought into antagonism with Athanasius himself, who, it has been seen, presided at Alexandria. Eventually he returned to his see in Sardinia where, according to Jerome's Chronicle, he died in 371. Luciferianism became extinct in the beginning of the following century, if not earlier. It hardly appears to have been formed into a separate organization, though an appeal was made to the emperor by some Luciferian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> about the year 384, and both Ambrose and Augustine speak of him as having fallen into the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.</p>

<p>The argument of the Dialogue may be thus stated. It has been pointed out above that Lucifer of Cagliari, who had been banished from his see in the reign of Constantius because of his adherence to the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of Athanasius, had, on the announcement of toleration at the accession of Julian (361), gone to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Paulinus a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. There were then three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, Dorotheus the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> (who had succeeded Euzoius in 376), Meletius who, though an Athanasian in opinion, had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> or Semi-<a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, and Paulinus; besides Vitalis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of a congregation of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarians</a>. Lucifer, in the earnestness of his anti-<a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> opinion, refused to acknowledge as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> those who had come over from <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, though he accepted the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. This opinion led to the Luciferian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and forms the subject of the Dialogue.</p>

<p>The point urged by Orthodoxus throughout is that, since the Luciferian accepts as valid the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> conferred by <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, it is inconsistent in him not to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have repented of their <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> opinions. The Luciferian at first (2) in his eagerness, declares the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> to be no better than <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>; but he sees that he has gone too far, and retracts this opinion. Still it is one thing, he says, (3) to admit a penitent <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a>, another to admit a man to be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and celebrate the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. We do not wish, he says (4) to preclude individuals who have fallen from repentance. And we, replies Orthodoxus, by admitting the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> save not them only but their flocks also. <q>The <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>,</q> says the Luciferian (5), <q>which has lost its savour cannot be salted,</q> and, <q>What communion has Christ with <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>?</q> But this, it is answered (6), would prove that <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> could not confer <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> at all. Yes, says the objector, they are like John the Baptist, whose <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> needed to be followed by that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But, it is replied, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gives Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and confers the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. The confirmation which follows (9) is rather a custom of the churches than the necessary means of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>The argument is felt to be approaching to a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> logomachy (10, 11), but it is resumed by the Luciferian. There is a real difference, he says (12), between the man who in his simplicity accepts <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> from an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself who understands the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Yet both, it is replied (13), when they are penitent, should be received.</p>

<p>At this point (14) the Luciferian yields. But he wishes to be assured that what Orthodoxus recommends has been really the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This leads to a valuable chapter of Church history. Orthodoxus recalls the victories of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which the Luciferians speak of as corrupt (15). The shame is that, though they have the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> creed, they have too little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He then describes (17, 18) how the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were beguiled into accepting the creed of Ariminum, but afterwards saw their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> (19). <q>The world groaned to find itself <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>.</q> They did all that was possible to set things right. Why should they not be received, as all but the authors of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> had been received at Nic&aelig;a? (20) Lucifer who was a good shepherd, and Hilary the Deacon, in separating their own small body into a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> have left the rest a prey to the wolf (20, 21). The wheat and tares must grow together (22). This has been the principle of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (23), as shown by Scripture (24) and Apostolic custom, and even Cyprian, when he wished penitent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to be re-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> (25), could not prevail. Even Hilary by receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which always has re-admitted <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in repentance (26, 27) acknowledges this principle. In that Church and its divisions and practice it is our duty to abide.</p>
</div>

<p>1. It happened not long ago that a follower of Lucifer had a dispute with a son of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. His loquacity was odious and the language he employed most abusive. For he declared that the world belonged to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and, as is commonly said by them at the present day, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was turned into a brothel. His opponent on the other hand, with reason indeed, but without due regard to time and place, urged that Christ did not die in vain, and that it was for something more than a Sardinian cloak of skins  that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> came down from heaven. To be brief, the dispute was not settled when night interrupted the debate, and the lighting of the street-lamps gave the signal for the assembly to disperse. The combatants therefore withdrew, almost spitting in each other's faces, an arrangement having been previously made by the audience for a meeting in a quiet porch at daybreak. Thither, accordingly, they all came, and it was resolved that the words of both speakers should be taken down by reporters.</p>

<p>2. When all were seated, Helladius the Luciferian said, I want an answer first to my question. Are the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> or not?</p>

<p>Orthodoxus. I answer with another question, Are all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>?</p>

<p>L. If you call a man a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> you deny that he is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</p>

<p>O. No <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, then, are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</p>

<p>L. I told you so before.</p>

<p>O. If they are not Christ's, they belong to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<p>L. No one doubts that.</p>

<p>O. But if they belong to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, it makes no difference whether they are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>.</p>

<p>L. I do not dispute the point.</p>

<p>O. We are then agreed that we must speak of a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> as we would of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>.</p>

<p>L. Just so.</p>

<p>O. Now it is decided that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, put any question you please.</p>

<p>L. What I wanted to elicit by my question has been expressly stated, namely, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Now comes the inference. If the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> are <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> too. But if the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> are <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and it is beyond dispute that the church has no communion with the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, that is with the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, it is clear that your church which welcomes <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, that is from the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, receives <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Capitol  rather than <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and accordingly it ought more correctly to be called the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of Anti-Christ than the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>O. Lo! What the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said is fulfilled: <q>They have dug a pit before me, they have fallen into the midst thereof themselves.</q></p>

<p>L. How so?</p>

<p>O. If the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> are, as you say, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and the assemblies of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> are the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> camp, how is it that you receive a person who has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> camp?</p>

<p>L. I do receive him, but as a penitent.</p>

<p>O. The fact is you don't <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what you are saying. Does any one receive a penitent <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>?</p>

<p>L. In my simplicity I replied when we began that all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. But the question was a captious one, and you shall have the full credit of victory in the first point. I will now proceed to the second and maintain that a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> coming from the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> ought to be received if penitent, but not a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>.</p>

<p>O. And yet, if you concede me the first point, the second is mine too.</p>

<p>L. Show me how it comes to be yours.</p>

<p>O. Don't you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> have only one Christ, and that there is not one God of converts and another of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>? Why then should not he who receives <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> receive <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> also?</p>

<p>L. There is a difference between shedding tears for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and handling the body of Christ; there is a difference between lying prostrate at the feet of the brethren, and from the high altar administering the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> to the people. It is one thing to lament over the past, another to abandon <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and live the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> life in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. You who yesterday impiously declared the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to be a creature, you who every day, worse than a Jew, were wont to cast the stones of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> at Christ, you whose hands are full of blood, whose pen was a soldier's spear, do you, the convert of a single hour, come into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as an adulterer might come to a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>? If you repent of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, abandon your <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions: if you are shameless in your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, remain what you were.</p>

<p>O. You are quite a rhetorician, and fly from the thicket of controversy to the open fields of declamation. But, I entreat you, refrain from common-places, and return to the ground and the lines marked out; afterwards, if you like, we will take a wider range.</p>

<p>L. There is no declamation in the case; my indignation is more than I can bear. Make what statements you please, argue as you please, you will never convince me that a penitent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should be treated like a penitent <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>.</p>

<p>O. Since you put the whole thing in a nutshell and obstinately cling to your position, that the case of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is different from that of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, I will do what you wish, and I shall not be sorry to avail myself of the opportunity you offer and come to close quarters. Explain why you receive a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> coming from the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, but do not receive a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<p>L. I receive a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> who confesses that he has erred; and the Lord wills not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should repent.</p>

<p>O. Receive then also a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who, as well as the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, confesses that he has erred, and it still holds good that the Lord wills not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should repent.</p>

<p>L. If he confesses his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> why does he continue a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>? Let him lay aside his episcopal functions, and I grant pardon to the penitent.</p>

<p>O. I will answer you in your own words. If a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> confesses his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, how is it he continues a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>? Let him lay aside his lay-<a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, that is, his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and I grant pardon to the penitent. For it is written <span class="stiki" id="note304053"><a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse6">Revelation&nbsp;1:6</a></span> <q>He made us to be a kingdom, to be <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> unto his God and Father.</q> And again, <span class="stiki" id="note304054"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:9</a></span> <q>A <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation, a royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, an elect race.</q> Everything which is forbidden to a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, is forbidden to both <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. He who does penance condemns his former life. If a penitent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may not continue what he was, neither may a penitent <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> remain in that state on account of which he confesses himself a penitent.</p>

<p>L. We receive the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, because no one will be induced to change, if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> he must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again. And then, if they are rejected, we become the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their destruction.</p>

<p>O. By receiving a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> you save a single <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and I in receiving a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> unite to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, I will not say the people of one city, but the whole province of which he is the head; if I drive him away, he will drag down many with him to ruin. Wherefore I beseech you to apply the same reason which you think you have for receiving the few to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the whole world. But if you are not satisfied with this, if you are so hard, or rather so unreasonably unmerciful as to think him who gave <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> an enemy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, though you account him who received it a son, we do not so contradict ourselves: we either receive a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as well as the people which is constituted as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people by him, or if we do not receive a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we must also reject his people.</p>

<p>5. L. Pray, have you not read what is said concerning the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note304056"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;5:13</a></span> <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> of the earth: but if the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of man.</q> And then there is the fact that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <span class="stiki" id="note304057"><a href="../bible/lev009.htm#verse7">Leviticus&nbsp;9:7</a></span> intercedes with God for the sinful people, while there is no one to entreat for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Now these two passages of Scripture tend to the same conclusion. For as <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> seasons all food and nothing is so pleasant as to please the palate without it: so the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the seasoning of the whole world and of his own Church, and if he lose his savour through the denial of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or through <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, or <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, or, to comprehend all in one word, through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of any kind, by what other can he be seasoned, when he was the seasoning of all? The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, offers his oblation for the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, lays his hand upon him when submissive, invokes the return of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and thus, after inviting the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the people, reconciles to the altar him who had been delivered to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit might he saved; nor does he restore one member to health until all the members have wept together with him. For a father easily pardons his son, when the mother entreats for her offspring. If then it is by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> order that a penitent <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> is restored to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and pardon follows where sorrow has gone before, it is clear that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who has been removed from his order cannot be restored to the place he has forfeited, because either he will be a penitent and then he cannot be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or if he continues to hold office he cannot be brought back to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by penitential discipline. Will you dare to spoil the savour of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> which has lost its savour? Will you replace at the altar the man who having been cast out ought to lie in the mire and be trodden under foot by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? What then will become of the Apostle's command, <span class="stiki" id="note304058"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse7">Titus&nbsp;1:7</a></span> <q>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be blameless as God's steward</q>? And again, <span class="stiki" id="note304059"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:28</a></span> <q>But let a man prove himself, and so let him come.</q> What becomes of our Lord's intimation, <span class="stiki" id="note304060"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span> <q>Neither cast your pearls before the swine</q>? But if you understand the words as a general admonition, how much more must care be exercised in the case of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> when so much precaution is taken where the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> are concerned? <span class="stiki" id="note304061"><a href="../bible/num016.htm#verse26">Numbers&nbsp;16:26</a></span> <q>Depart, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you,</q> says the Lord by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>from the tents of these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> And again in the Minor Prophets, <span class="stiki" id="note304062"><a href="../bible/hos009.htm#verse4">Hosea&nbsp;9:4</a></span> <q>Their <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted.</q> And in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the Lord says, <span class="stiki" id="note304063"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;7:22</a></span> <q>The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore your eye be single, your whole body shall be full of light.</q> For when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> preaches the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the darkness is scattered from the hearts of all. And he gives the reason, <span class="stiki" id="note304064"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;5:15</a></span> <q>Neither do men light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shines unto all that are in the house.</q> That is, God's motive for lighting the fire of His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is that he may not shine for himself only, but for the common benefit. And in the next sentence <span class="stiki" id="note304065"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;6:23-24</a></span> <q>If,</q> says he, <q>your eye be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, your whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you be darkness, how great is the darkness!</q> And rightly; for since the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is appointed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that he may restrain the people from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, how great will the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the people be when he himself who teaches <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a>. How can he remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, who is himself a sinner? How can an impious man make a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>? How shall the light enter into me, when my eye is blind? O misery! <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist's</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> governs the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And what are we to think of the words, <span class="stiki" id="note304066"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;6:23-24</a></span> <q>No man can serve two masters</q>?

For it is not the number of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> that avails, but their weight. And all this proves that you with a little leaven have corrupted the whole lump of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and receive the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> today from the hand of one whom yesterday you loathed like an idol.</p>

<p>6. O. Your memory has served you, and you have certainly given us at great length many quotations from the sacred books: but after going all round the wood, you are caught in my hunting-nets. Let the case be as you would have it, that an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the enemy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let him be the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> that has lost its savour, let him be a lamp without flame, let him be an eye without a pupil: no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> your argument will take you thus far&mdash; that he cannot <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> another who himself has no <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>: a blind man cannot enlighten others, nor set them on fire when his own light has gone out. But why, when you swallow food which he has seasoned, do you reproach the seasoned with being saltless? Your Church is bright with his flame, and do you accuse his lamp of being extinguished? He gives you eyes, and are you blind? Wherefore, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, either give him the power of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> since you approve his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or reject his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> if you do not think him a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. For it is impossible that he who is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should be a sinner at the altar.</p>

<p>L. But when I receive a lay penitent, it is with <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a>, and invocation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> cannot be given by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<p>O. All the paths of your propositions lead to the same meeting-point, and it is with you as with the frightened deer&mdash; while you fly from the feathers fluttering in the wind, you become entangled in the strongest of nets. For seeing that a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, becomes a temple of the Lord, and that while the old abode is destroyed a new shrine is built for the Trinity, how can you say that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> can be remitted among the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> without the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? How is a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> purged from its former stains which has not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? For it is not mere water which washes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but it is itself first purified by the Spirit that it may be able to spiritually wash the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men. <span class="stiki" id="note304071"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;1:2</a></span> <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a>,</q> says <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>moved upon the face of the waters,</q> from which it appears that there is no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Bethesda, the pool in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, could not cure the limbs of those who suffered from bodily weakness without the advent of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>,  and do you venture to bring me a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> washed with simple water, as though it had just come from the bath? <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself, of whom it is less correct to say that He was cleansed by washing than that by the washing of Himself He cleansed all waters, no sooner raised His head from the stream than He received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Not that He ever was without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, inasmuch as He was born in the flesh through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; but in order to prove that to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> comes. So then if an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> cannot give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, he cannot even <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, because there is no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. And you, when you receive a person <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> and afterwards invoke the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, ought either to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> him, because without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> he could not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, or, if he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, you must not invoke the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> for your convert who received Him at the time of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<p>7. L. Pray tell me, have you not read  in the Acts of the Apostles that those who had already been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John, on their saying in reply to the Apostle's question that they had not even heard what the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was, afterwards obtained the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? Whence it is clear that it is possible to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and yet not to have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</p>

<p>O. I do not think that those who form our audience are so <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the sacred books that many words are needed to settle this little question. But before I say anything in support of my assertion, listen while I point out what confusion, upon your view, is introduced into Scripture. What do we mean by saying that John in his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> could not give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to others, yet gave him to Christ? And who is that John? <q>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</q> He who used to say, <span class="stiki" id="note304075"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;1:29</a></span> <q>Behold the Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the world</q>: I say too little, he who from his mother's womb cried out, <span class="stiki" id="note304076"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;1:43</a></span> <q>And whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come unto me,</q> did he not give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? And did <span class="stiki" id="note304077"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse17">Acts&nbsp;9:17</a></span> Ananias give him to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? It perhaps looks like boldness in me to prefer him to all other men. Hear then the words of our Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note304078"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;11:11</a></span> <q>Among them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> there has not arisen a greater than John the Baptist.</q> For no <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had the good fortune both to announce the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to point Him out with the finger. And what necessity is there for me to dwell upon the praises of so illustrious a man when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father even calls him an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note304079"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;11:10</a></span> <q>Behold, I send my messenger (<a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>) before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.</q> He must have been an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who after lodging in his mother's womb at once began to frequent the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> wilds, and while still an infant played with serpents; who, when his eyes had once gazed on Christ thought nothing else worth looking at; who exercised his voice, worthy of a messenger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the words of the Lord, which are sweeter than honey and the honey-comb. And, to delay my question no further, thus it behooved the Forerunner of the Lord to grow up. Now is it possible that a man of such character and renown did not give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, while Cornelius the centurion received Him before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>? Tell me, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, why could he not give Him? You don't <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>? Then listen to the teaching of Scripture: the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John did not so much consist in the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as in being a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of repentance for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that is, for a future remission, which was to follow through the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For it is written, <span class="stiki" id="note304081"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse4">Mark&nbsp;1:4</a></span> <q>John came, who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the wilderness, and preached the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of repentance unto remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> And soon after, <span class="stiki" id="note304082"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse5">Mark&nbsp;1:5</a></span> <q>And they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> of him in the river Jordan, confessing their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> For as he himself preceded Christ as His forerunner, so also his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was the prelude to the Lord's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note304083"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;3:31</a></span> <q>He that is of the earth,</q> he said, <q>speaks of the earth; he that comes from heaven is above all.</q> And again, <span class="stiki" id="note304084"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;3:11</a></span> <q>I indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with water, he shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> But if John, as he himself confessed, did not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, it follows that he did not forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> either, for no man has his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> remitted without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Or if you contentiously argue that, because the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John was from heaven, therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were forgiven by it, show me what more there is for us to get in Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Because it forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, it releases from Gehenna. Because it releases from Gehenna, it is perfect. But no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> can be called perfect except that which depends on the cross and resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Thus, although John himself said, <span class="stiki" id="note304085"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;3:30</a></span> <q>He must increase, but I must decrease,</q> in your perverse scrupulosity you give more than is due to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the servant, and destroy that of the master to which you leave no more than to the other. What is the drift of your assertion? Just this&mdash; it does not strike you as strange that those who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John, should afterwards by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, although it is evident that they did not obtain even remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> apart from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was to follow. But you who receive a person <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and allow him to have perfect <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, after that admission do you invoke the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as if this were still some slight defect, whereas there is no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? But I have wandered too far, and when I might have met my opponent face to face and repelled his attack, I have only thrown a few light darts from a distance. The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John was so far imperfect that it is plain they who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him were afterwards <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For thus the history relates, <q>And it came to pass that while Apollos was at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> having passed through the upper country came to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, and found certain <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: and he said unto them, Did ye receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> when you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>? And they said unto him, Nay, we did not so much as hear whether the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was given. And he said, Into what then were ye <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? And they said, Into John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, John <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him which should come after him, that is, on Jesus. And when they heard this, they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into the name of the Lord Jesus: And when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had laid his hands upon them, immediately the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> fell on them.</q> If then they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and lawful <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and thus received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: do you follow the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those who have not had <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and you will be able to invoke the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</p>

<p>8. L. Thirsty men in their dreams eagerly gulp down the water of the stream, and the more they drink the thirstier they are. In the same way you appear to me to have searched everywhere for arguments against the point I raised, and yet to be as far as ever from being satisfied. Don't you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and then the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is a custom of the Churches? Do you demand Scripture <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>? You may find it in the Acts of the Apostles. And even if it did not rest on the authority of Scripture the consensus of the whole world in this respect would have the force of a command. For many other observances of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, which are due to tradition, have acquired the authority of the written law, as for instance the practice of dipping the head three times in the laver, and then, after leaving the water, of tasting mingled milk and honey in representation of infancy; and, again, the practices of standing up in worship on the Lord's day, and ceasing from <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> every Pentecost; and there are many other unwritten practices which have won their place through reason and custom. So you see we follow the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, although it may be clear that a person was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> before the Spirit was invoked.</p>

<p>9. O. I do not deny that it is the practice of the Churches in the case of those who living far from the greater towns have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to visit them, and by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> to invoke the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> upon them. But how shall I describe your habit of applying the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and of exposing the virgin entrusted to you in the brothels of harlots? If a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> lays his hands on men he lays them on those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, and who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, are three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> has no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> but this (close your ears, my hearers, that you may not be defiled by words so grossly impious), that the Father alone is very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Saviour is a creature, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> the Servant of both. How can he then receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who has not yet obtained remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> must have a clean abode: nor will He become a dweller in that temple which has not for its chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But if you now ask how it is that a person <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Whom we declare to be given in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, except by the hands of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, let me tell you that our authority for the rule is the fact that after our Lord's ascension the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descended upon the Apostles. And in many places we find it the practice, more by way of honouring the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> than from any compulsory law. Otherwise, if the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descends only at the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, they are greatly to be pitied who in isolated houses, or in forts, or retired places, after being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> have fallen asleep before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> visitation. The well-being of a Church depends upon the dignity of its chief-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and unless some extraordinary and unique functions be assigned to him, we shall have as many schisms in the Churches as there are <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Hence it is that without ordination and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> license neither <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> nor <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> has the power to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. And yet, if necessity so be, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that even <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> may, and frequently do, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. For as a man receives, so too he can give; for it will hardly be said that we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the eunuch whom Philip  <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> lacked the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. The Scripture thus speaks concerning him, <q>And they both went down into the water; and Philip <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> him.</q> And on leaving the water, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> fell upon the eunuch.</q> You may perhaps think that we ought to set against this the passage in which we read, <q>Now when the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> which were at Jerusalem heard that <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> had received the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they sent unto them Peter and John: who, when they had come down, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them that they might receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: for as yet he was fallen upon none of them.</q> But why this was, the context tells us&mdash;<q>Only they had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>. Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> And if you here say that you do the same, because the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, I must remind you that Philip was not separated from the Apostles, but belonged to the same Church and preached the same Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>: that he was without question a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of those who afterwards laid their hands on his converts. But when you say that the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> have not a Church, but a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and that their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> do not worship God but creatures and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, how can you maintain that you ought to act upon the same principle in cases so totally different?</p>

<p>L. You repel my attack in front with vigour and firmness: but you are smitten in the rear and leave your back exposed to the darts. Let us even grant that the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> have no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and therefore that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> cannot be given by them, because they themselves have not yet received remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; this altogether makes for victory on my side, and all your argumentative wrestling is but laborious toil to give me the conqueror's palm. An <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> has no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; how is it then that he has the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>? There is not even a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> among them, how can there be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>? I may not receive a beggar, do you receive a king? You surrender your camp to the enemy, and are we to reject one of their deserters?</p>

<p>11. O. If you remember what has been said you would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you have been already answered; but in yielding to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of contradiction you have wandered from the subject, like those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are talkative rather than eloquent, and who, when they cannot argue, still continue to wrangle. On the present occasion it is not my aim to either accuse or defend the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, but rather to get safely past the turning-post of the race, and to maintain that we receive a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the same reason that you receive a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. If you grant forgiveness to the erring, I too pardon the penitent. If he that baptizes a person into our belief has had no injurious effect upon the person <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, it follows that he who consecrates a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> causes no defilement to the person <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. Heresy is subtle, and therefore the simple-minded are easily deceived. To be deceived is the common lot of both <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But you say, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> could not have been mistaken. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, men are elected to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> who come from the bosom of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and Aristophanes. How many can you find among them who are not fully instructed in these writers? Indeed all, whoever they may be, that are ordained at the present day from among the literate class make it their study not how to seek out the marrow of Scripture, but how to tickle the ears of the people with the flowers of rhetoric. We must further add that the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> goes hand in hand with the wisdom of the world, and  borrows its streams of argument from the fountains of Aristotle. And so we will act like children when they try to outdo one another&mdash; whatever you say I will say: what you assert, I will assert: whatever you deny, I will deny. We allow that an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> may <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>; then he must be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.  If we agree that <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is invalid, you must reject the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, and I must not accept the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. I will follow you wherever you go; we shall either stick in the mud together, or shall get out together.</p>

<p>12. L. We pardon a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> because, when he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, he had a sincere impression that he was joining the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in accordance with his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>O. That is something new for a man to be made a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> by one who is not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. When he joined the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> into what <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? Of course into that which the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> held. If on the other hand we are to suppose that his own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was correct, but that he was knowingly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, he does not deserve the indulgence we grant to the erring. But it is quite absurd to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that, going as a pupil to the master, he understands his art before he has been taught. Can you suppose that a man who has just turned from worshipping <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Christ better than his teacher does? If you say, he sincerely <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and therefore obtained <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, what, let me ask, is the meaning of being sincerely <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what one believes? He sincerely <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. What did he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? Surely when he heard the three names, he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in three Gods, and was an idolater; or by the three titles he was led to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a God with three names, and so fell into the Sabellian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Or he was perhaps trained by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but that the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are creatures. What else he may have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not: for we can hardly think that a man brought up in the Capitol would have learned the doctrine of the co-essential Trinity. He would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in that case that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are not divided in nature, but in person. He would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> also that the name of Son was implied in that of Father and the name of Father in that of Son. It is ridiculous to assert that any one can dispute concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> before he believes it; that he understands a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> before he has been initiated; that the baptizer and the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> hold different views respecting God. Besides, it is the custom at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to ask, after the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Trinity, do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Holy Church? Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? What Church do you say he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in? The Church of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>? But they have no Church. In ours? But the man was not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into it: he could not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in that whereof he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>.</p>

<p>L. I see that you can prattle cleverly about each point that I raise; and when we let fly a dart you elude it by a harangue which serves you for a shield; I will therefore hurl a single spear which will be strong enough to pierce your defences and the hail-storm of your words. I won't allow strength any longer to be overcome by artifice. Even a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if he be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is received only as a penitent: but a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> either does no penance and remains a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or, if he does penance he ceases to be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Wherefore we do right both in welcoming the penitent <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, and in rejecting the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, if he wishes to continue in his office.</p>

<p>O. An arrow which is discharged from the tight-drawn bow is not easy to avoid, for it reaches him at whom it was aimed before the shield can be raised to stop it. On the other hand your propositions are pointless and therefore cannot pierce an opponent. The spear then which you have hurled with all your might and about which you speak such threatening words, I turn aside, as the saying is, with my little finger. The point in dispute is not merely whether a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is incapable of penitence and a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> capable, but whether a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> has received valid <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. If he has not (and this follows from your position), how can he be a penitent, before he is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? Show me that a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> coming from the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> has valid <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and then I will not deny him penitence. But if he is not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, if he had no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to make him a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, how can he do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> when he is not yet a believer?</p>

<p>14. L. I beseech you lay aside the methods of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and let us talk with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> simplicity; that is, if you are willing to follow not the logicians, but the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilean</a> fishermen. Does it seem right to you that an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> should be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>?</p>

<p>O. You prove him a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> because you receive those he has <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. And it is here that you are to blame:&mdash; Why are there walls of separation between us when we are at one in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and in receiving <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>?</p>

<p>L. I asked you before not to talk like a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, but like a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</p>

<p>O. Do you wish to learn, or to argue?</p>

<p>L. Of course I argue because I want to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the reason for what you do.</p>

<p>O. If you argue, you have already had an answer. I receive an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for the same reason that you receive a person who is only <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. If you wish to learn, come over to my side: for an opponent must be overcome, it is only a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> who can be taught.</p>

<p>L. Before I can be a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, I must hear one preach whom I feel to be my master.</p>

<p>O. You are not dealing quite fairly: you wish me to be your teacher on the terms that you may treat me as an opponent whenever you please. I will teach you therefore in the same spirit. We agree in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we agree in receiving <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, let us also be at one in our terms of communion.</p>

<p>L. That is not teaching, but arguing.</p>

<p>O. As you ask for peace with a shield in your hand, I also must carry my olive branch with a sword grafted in it.</p>

<p>L. I drop my hands in token of submission. You are conqueror. But in laying down my arms, I ask the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> you force me to take.</p>

<p>O. Certainly, but first I congratulate you, and thank Christ my God for your good dispositions which have made you turn from the unsavoury teaching of the Sardinians to that which the whole world approves as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and no longer say as some do, <q>Help, Lord; for the godly man teases.</q> By their impious words they make of none effect the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, subject the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and would have us now understand the Lord's lamentation over sinners to apply to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <q>What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?</q> But God forbid that our Lord should have died in vain. <span class="stiki" id="note304100"><a href="../bible/mar003.htm#verse27">Mark&nbsp;3:27</a></span> The strong man is bound, and his goods are spoiled. What the Father says is fulfilled, <q>Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.</q> <q>Then the channels of water appeared, and the foundations of the world were laid bare.</q> <q>In them has he set a tabernacle for the sun, and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.</q> The Psalmist fully possessed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sings, <q>The swords of the enemy have come to an end, and the cities which you have overthrown.</q></p>

<p>15. And what is the position, I should like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, of those excessively scrupulous, or rather excessively profane <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who assert that there are more <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> than Churches? How is it that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> kingdoms have been destroyed, and now at last in the consummation of the ages, the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> have fallen? If Christ has no Church, or if he has one only, in Sardinia, he has grown very poor. And if <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> owns Britain, <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, the East, the races of India, barbarous nations, and the whole world at the same time, how is it that the trophies of the cross have been collected in a mere corner of the earth? Christ's powerful opponent, forsooth, gave over to him the serpent of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>: he disdained to own a poor province and its half-starved inhabitants. If they flatter themselves that they have on their side that verse of the gospel, <span class="stiki" id="note304106"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;18:8</a></span> <q>Howbeit when the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> comes, shall he find <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the earth?</q> let me remind them that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in question is that of which the Lord himself said, <span class="stiki" id="note304107"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;9:22</a></span> <q>Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has made you whole.</q> And elsewhere, of the centurion, <span class="stiki" id="note304108"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;8:10</a></span> <q>I have not found so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, no, not in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> And again, to the Apostles, <span class="stiki" id="note304109"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;8:26</a></span> <q>Why are you fearful, O you of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>?</q> In another place also, <span class="stiki" id="note304110"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;17:20</a></span> <q>If you have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove.</q> For neither the centurion nor that poor <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who for twelve years was wasting away with a bloody flux, had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the Trinity, for these were revealed to the Apostles after the resurrection of Christ; so that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of such as <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Trinity might have its due preeminence: but it was her singleness of mind and her devotion to her God that met with our Lord's approval: <span class="stiki" id="note304111"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;9:21</a></span> <q>For she said within herself, If I do but touch his garment, I shall be made whole.</q> This is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which our Lord said was seldom found. This is the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which even in the case of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> aright is hard to find in perfection. <span class="stiki" id="note304112"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;9:29</a></span> <q>According to your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, be it done unto you,</q> says God. I do not, indeed, like the sound of those words. For if it be done unto me according to my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, I shall perish. And yet I certainly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nevertheless, I would not have it done unto me according to my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For the enemy often comes, and sows tares in the Lord's harvest. I do not mean to imply that anything is greater than the purity of heart which believes that <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>; but undoubted <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> towards God it is hard indeed to find. To make my meaning plain, let us suppose a case:&mdash; I stand to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; I could not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, if I did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; but if I really <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, I should cleanse that heart of mine with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen, I should beat my hands upon my breast, the tears would stream down my cheeks, my body would shudder, my face grow pale, I should lie at my Lord's feet, weep over them, and wipe them with my hair, I should cling to the cross and not let go my hold until I obtained mercy. But, as it is, frequently in my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> I am either walking in the arcades, or calculating my interest, or am carried away by base thoughts, so as to be occupied with things the mere mention of which makes me blush. Where is our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Are we to suppose that it was thus that Jonah <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>? Or the three youths? Or Daniel in the lion's den? Or the robber on the cross? I have given these illustrations that you may understand my meaning. But let every one commune with his own heart, and he will find throughout the whole of life how rare a thing it is to find a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> so faithful that it does nothing through the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, nothing on account of the petty gossip of men. For he who <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> does not as an immediate consequence fast unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor he who holds out his hand to a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man, lend to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Vice is next-door neighbour to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. It is hard to rest content with God alone for judge.</p>

<p>16. L. I was reserving that passage until last, and you have anticipated my question about it. Almost all our party, or rather not mine any more, use it as a sort of controversial battering ram: as such I am exceedingly glad to see it broken to pieces and pulverized. But will you be so good as to fully explain to me, not in the character of an opponent but of a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, why it is that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> receives those who come from the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>? The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is I am unable to answer you a word, but I do not yet give a hearty assent to what you say.</p>

<p>17. O. When Constantius was on the throne and Eusebius and Hypatius were Consuls, there was composed, under the pretext of unity and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,  an unfaithful creed, as it is now acknowledged to have been. For at that time, nothing seemed so characteristic of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, nothing so befitting a servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as to follow after unity, and to shun separation from communion with the rest of the world. And all the more because the current profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> no longer exhibited on the face of it anything profane. <q>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</q> said they, <q>in one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father Almighty. This we also confess: We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who, before all worlds, and before all their origins,  was born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The only-begotten Son, moreover, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be born alone of the Father alone, God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, like to his Father who begot Him, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; whose birth no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, but the Father alone who begot Him.</q> Do we find any such words inserted here as <q>There was a time, when he was not?</q> Or, <q>The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is a creature though not made of things which exist.</q> No. This is surely the perfection of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to say we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to be God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Moreover, they called Him the only begotten, <q>born alone of the Father.</q> What is the meaning of <em>born?</em> Surely, <em>not made</em>. His birth removed all suspicion of His being a creature. They added further, <q>Who came down from heaven, was conceived of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, born of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, crucified by <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, rose again the third day from the dead, ascended into heaven, sits at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who will come to judge the quick and the dead.</q> There was the ring of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> in the words, and no one thought that poison was mingled with the honey of such a proclamation.</p>

<p>18. As regards the term  <em>Usia</em>, it was not rejected without a show of reason for so doing. <q>Because it is not found in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>,</q> they said, <q>and its novelty is a stumbling-block to many, we have thought it best to dispense with it.</q> The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were not anxious about the name, so long as that which it implied was secured. Lastly, at the very time when rumour was rife that there had been some insincerity in the statement of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, Valens, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Mursa, who had drawn it up, in the presence of Taurus the pretorian prefect who attended the Synod by imperial command, declared that he was not an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, and that he utterly abhorred their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>. However, the thing had been done in secret, and it had not extinguished the general feeling. So on another day, when crowds of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> came together in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at Ariminum, Muzonius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the province of Byzacena, to whom by reason of seniority the first rank was assigned by all, spoke as follows: <q>One of our number has been authorized to read to you, reverend fathers, what reports are being spread and have reached us, so that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> opinions which ought to grate upon our ears and be banished from our hearts may be condemned with one voice by us all.</q> The whole body of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> replied, Agreed. And so when Claudius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the province of Picenum, at the request of all present, began to read the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> attributed to Valens, Valens denied they were his and cried aloud, <q>If anyone denies Christ our Lord, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, begotten of the Father before the worlds, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</q> There was a general chorus of approval, <q>Let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</q> <q>If anyone denies that the Son is like the Father according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</q> All replied, <q>Let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</q> <q>If anyone does not say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is co-eternal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</q> There was again a chorus of approval, <q>Let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</q> <q>If anyone says that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is a creature, like other creatures, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</q> The answer was the same, <q>Let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</q> <q>If anyone says that the Son was of no existing things, yet not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</q> All shouted together, <q>Let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</q> <q>If anyone says, There was a time when the Son was not, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</q> At this point all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> together received the words of Valens with clapping of hands and stamping of feet. And if anyone thinks we have invented the story let him examine the public records. At all events the muniment-boxes of the Churches are full of it, and the circumstance is fresh in men's memory. Some of those who took part in the Synod are still alive, and the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> themselves (a fact which may put the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> beyond dispute) do not deny the accuracy of our account. When, therefore, all extolled Valens to the sky and penitently condemned themselves for having suspected him, the same Claudius who before had begun to read, said <q>There are still a few points which have escaped the notice of my lord and brother Valens; if it seem good to you, let us, in order to remove all scruples, pass a general vote of censure upon them. If anyone says that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was indeed before all worlds but was by no means before all time, so that he puts some thing before Him, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</q> And many other things which had a suspicious look were condemned by Valens when Claudius recited them. If anyone wishes to learn more about them he will find the account in the acts of the Synod of Ariminum, the source from which I have myself drawn them.</p>

<p>19. After these proceedings the Council was dissolved. All returned in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> to their own provinces. For the Emperor and all good men had one and the same aim, that the East and West should be knit together by the bond of fellowship. But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> does not long lie hidden, and the sore that is healed superficially before the bad humour has been worked off breaks out again. Valens and Ursacius and others associated with them in their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, eminent <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of course, began to wave their palms, and to say they had not denied that He was a creature, but that He was like other creatures. At that moment the term <em>Usia</em> was abolished: the Nicene Faith stood condemned by acclamation. The whole world groaned, and was astonished to find itself <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>. Some, therefore, remained in their own communion, others began to send letters to those Confessors who as adherents of Athanasius were in exile; several despairingly bewailed the better relations into which they had entered. But a few, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, defended their mistake as an exhibition of wisdom. The ship of the Apostles was in peril, she was driven by the wind, her sides beaten with the waves: no hope was now left. But the Lord awoke and bade the tempest cease; the beast died, and there was a calm once again. To speak more plainly, all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been banished from their sees, by the clemency of the new emperor returned to their Churches. Then <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> welcomed the triumphant Athanasius; then Hilary returned from the battle to the embrace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>; then Eusebius returned and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> laid aside her mourning weeds. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been caught in the snare at Ariminum and had unwittingly come to be reported of as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, began to assemble, while they called the Body of our Lord and all that is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that they had not a suspicion of anything faulty in their own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. We thought, said they, the words were to be taken in their natural meaning, and we had no suspicion that in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, the very home of simplicity and sincerity in the confession of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, one thing could be kept secret in the heart, another uttered by the lips. We thought too well of bad men and were deceived. We did not suppose that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Christ were fighting against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. There was much besides which they said with tears, but I pass it over for brevity's sake. They were ready to condemn their former subscription as well as all the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. Here I ask our excessively scrupulous friends what they think ought to have been done with those who made this Confession? Deprive the old <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, they will say, and ordain new ones. The plan was tried. But how many whose <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> does not condemn them will allow themselves to be deprived. Particularly when all the people who loved their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> flocked together, ready to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> and slay those who attempted to deprive them. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should, it may be said, have kept to themselves within their own communion. That is to say, with senseless cruelty they would have surrendered the whole world to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Why condemn those who were not <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>? Why rend the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> when it was continuing in the harmony of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Lastly, were they by obstinacy to make <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>? We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that at the Council of Nic&aelig;a, which was assembled on account of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> perfidy, eight <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were welcomed, and there is not a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the world at the present day whose ordination is not dependent on that Council. This being so, how could they act in opposition to it, when their loyalty to it had cost them the pain of exile?</p>

<p>20. L. Were <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> really then received after all? Pray tell me who they were.</p>

<p>O. Eusebius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, Theognis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Nic&aelig;a, Saras, at the time <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of Libya, Eusebius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">C&aelig;sarea in Palestine</a>, and others whom it would be tedious to enumerate; <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> also, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, the original source of all the trouble; Euzoius the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>,  who succeeded Eudoxius as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and Achillas, the reader. These three who were <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Church of Alexandria</a> were the originators of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<p>L. Suppose a person were to deny that they were welcomed back, how is he to be refuted?</p>

<p>O. There are men still living who took part in that Council. And if that is not enough, because owing to the time that has elapsed they are but few, and it is impossible for witnesses to be everywhere, if we read the acts and names of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Council of Nic&aelig;a, we find that those who we saw just now were welcomed back, did subscribe the <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a></em> along with the rest.</p>

<p>L. Will you point out how, after the Council of Nic&aelig;a, they relapsed into their unfaithfulness?</p>

<p>O. A good suggestion, for unbelievers are in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of shutting their eyes and denying that things which they dislike ever happened. But how could they afterwards do anything but relapse, when it was owing to them that the Council was convened, and their letters and impious treatises which were published before the Council, remain even to the present day? Seeing, therefore, that at that time three hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or more welcomed a few men whom they might have rejected without injury to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, I am surprised that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who are certainly upholders of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Nic&aelig;a, are so harsh as to think that three Confessors returning from exile were not bound in the interests of the world's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to do what so many illustrious men did of their own accord. But, to go back to our starting point, on the return of the Confessors it was determined, in a synod afterwards  held at Alexandria, that, the authors of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> excepted (who could not be excused on the ground of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>), penitents should be admitted to communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: not that they who had been <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> could be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but because it was clear that those who were received had not been <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. The West assented to this decision, and it was through this conclusion, which the necessities of the times demanded, that the world was snatched from the jaws of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. I have reached a very difficult subject, where I am compelled against my wishes and my purpose, to think somewhat otherwise of that saintly man Lucifer than his merits demand, and my own courtesy requires. But what am I to do? Truth opens my mouth and urges my reluctant tongue to utter the thoughts of my heart. At such a crisis of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when the wolves were wildly raging, he separated off a few sheep and abandoned the remnant of the flock. He himself was a good shepherd, but he was leaving a vast spoil to the beasts of prey. I take no notice of reports originating with certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speakers, though maintained by them to be authenticated facts; such as that he acted thus through the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the desire of handing down his name to posterity; or again that he was influenced by the grudge he bore against Eusebius on account of the quarrel at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> none of these reports in the case of such a man; and this I will constantly affirm even now&mdash; that the difference between us and him is one of words, not of things, if he really does receive those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>.</p>

<p>21. L. The account I used before to hear given of these things was widely different, and, as I now think, better calculated to promote <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> than hope. But I thank Christ my God for pouring into my heart the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that I might no longer profanely call the Church, which is His Virgin, the harlot of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. There is one other point I should like you to explain. What are we to say about Hilary who does not receive even those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>?</p>

<p>O. Since Hilary when he left the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was only a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is to him, though to him alone, a mere worldly multitude, he can neither duly celebrate the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, for he has no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, nor can he give <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> without the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. And since the man is now dead, inasmuch as he was a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and could ordain no one to follow him, his <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> died with him. For there is no such thing as a Church without <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. But passing over a few very insignificant <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are in their own esteem both <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, let me point out to you what views we should hold respecting the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at large.</p>

<p>L. You have settled a great question in three words, as the saying is, and indeed while you speak, I feel that I am on your side. But when you stop, some old misgivings arise as to why we receive those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<p>O. That is just what I had in mind when I said I would point out what views we ought to hold concerning the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at large. For many are exercised by the misgivings you speak of. I shall perhaps be tedious in my explanation, but it is worth while if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> gains.</p>

<p>22. <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah's</a> ark was a type of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as the Apostle Peter says&mdash; <span class="stiki" id="note304134"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:20</a></span> <q>In <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah's</a> ark few, that is, eight <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, were saved through water: which also after a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> likeness does now save us, even <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</q> As in the ark there were all kinds of animals, so also in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there are men of all races and characters. As in the one there was the leopard with the kids, the wolf with the lambs, so in the other there are found the righteous and sinners, that is, <span class="stiki" id="note304135"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse20">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:20</a></span> vessels of gold and silver with those of wood and of earth. The ark had its rooms: the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has many mansions. Eight <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were saved in <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah's</a> ark. And <span class="stiki" id="note304136"><a href="../bible/ecc011.htm#verse2">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;11:2</a></span> Ecclesiastes bids us <q>give a portion to seven yea, even unto eight,</q> that is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> both Testaments. This is why some psalms bear the inscription  <em>for the octave</em>, and why the one hundred and nineteenth psalm is divided into portions of eight verses each beginning with its own letter for the instruction of the righteous. The beatitudes which our Lord spoke to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> on the mountain, thereby delineating the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are eight. And Ezekiel for the building of the temple employs the number eight. And you will find many other things expressed in the same way in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. The raven also is sent forth from the ark but does not return, and afterwards the dove announces peace to the earth. So also in the Church's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, that most unclean bird the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is expelled, and the dove of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> announces peace to our earth. The construction of the ark was such that it began with being thirty cubits broad and gradually narrowed to one. Similarly the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, consisting of many grades, ends in <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The ark was in peril in the flood, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is in peril in the world. When <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> left the ark he planted a vineyard, drank thereof, and was drunken. Christ also, born in the flesh, planted the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and suffered. The elder son made sport of his father's nakedness, the younger covered it: and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> mocked God crucified, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> honoured Him. The daylight would fail me if I were to explain all the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the ark and compare them with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Who are the eagles among us? Who the doves and lions, who the stags, who the worms and serpents? So far as our subject requires I will briefly show you. It is not the sheep only who abide in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, nor do clean birds only fly to and fro there; but amid the grain other seed is sown, <q>amidst the neat grain-fields burrs and caltrops and barren oats lord it in the land.</q> What is the husbandman to do? Root up the darnel? In that case the whole harvest is destroyed along with it. Every day the farmer diligently drives the birds away with strange noises, or frightens them with scarecrows: here he cracks a whip, there he spreads out some other object to terrify them. Nevertheless he suffers from the raids of nimble roes or the wantonness of the wild asses; here the mice convey the grain to their garners underground, there the ants crowd thickly in and ravage the grain-field. Thus the case stands. No one who has land is free from care. While the householder slept the enemy sowed tares among the wheat, and when the servants proposed to go and root them up the master forbade them, reserving for himself the separation of the chaff and the grain. There are vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and of mercy which the Apostle speaks of in the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The day then will come when the storehouses of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> shall be opened and the Lord will bring forth the vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; and, as they depart, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will say, <span class="stiki" id="note304141"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:19</a></span> <q>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> have continued with us.</q> No one can take to himself the prerogative of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, no one before the day of judgment can pass judgment upon men. If the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is already cleansed, what shall we reserve for the Lord? <span class="stiki" id="note304142"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse12">Proverbs&nbsp;14:12</a></span> <q>There is a way which seems right unto a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but the end thereof are the ways of death.</q> When our judgment is so prone to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, upon whose opinion can we rely?</p>

<p>23. Cyprian of blessed memory tried to avoid broken cisterns and not to drink of strange waters: and therefore, rejecting <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, he summoned his African synod in opposition to Stephen,  who was the blessed Peter's twenty-second successor in the see of Rome. They met to discuss this matter; but the attempt failed. At last those very <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had together with him determined that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> must be re-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, reverted to the old custom and published a fresh decree. Do you ask what course we must pursue? What we do our forefathers handed down to us as their forefathers to them. But why speak of later times? When the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was but lately shed and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were still in Jud&aelig;a, the Lord's body was asserted to be a phantom; the Galatians had been led away to the observance of the law, and the Apostle was a second time in travail with them; the Corinthians did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the resurrection of the flesh, and he endeavoured by many arguments to bring them back to the right path. Then came <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> Menander. They asserted themselves to be powers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Then <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> invented the most high god <em>Abraxas</em> and the three hundred and sixty-five manifestations of him. Then Nicolas, one of the seven Deacons, and one whose lechery <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no rest by night or day, indulged in his filthy dreams. I say nothing of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who before the coming of Christ destroyed the law delivered to them: of  <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a>, the leader of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> who rejected the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: of the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> who sprang from his root and denied even the resurrection of the flesh: of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> who separated themselves from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>  on account of certain superfluous observances, and took their name from the fact of their dissent: of the Herodians who accepted <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> as the Christ. I come to those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who have mangled the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, Saturninus, and the Ophites, the Cainites and Sethites, and Carpocrates, and <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>, and his successor Ebion, and the other pests, the most of which broke out while the apostle John was still alive, and yet we do not read that any of these men were re-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<p>24. As we have made mention of that distinguished saint, let us show also from his Apocalypse that repentance unaccompanied by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> ought to be allowed valid in the case of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. It is imputed <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse4">Revelation 2:4</a></span> to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of Ephesus that he has forsaken his first <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Pergamum the eating of idol-<a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> is censured <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse14">Revelation 2:14</a></span>, and the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaitans</a> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse15">Revelation 2:15</a></span>. Likewise the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of Thyatira is rebuked <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse20">Revelation 2:20</a></span> on account of <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel</a> the prophetess, and the idol meats, and fornication. And yet the Lord encourages all these to repent, and adds a threat, moreover, of future punishment if they do not turn. Now he would not urge them to repent unless he intended to grant pardon to the penitents. Is there any indication of his having said, Let them be re-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaitans</a>? Or let hands be laid upon those of the people of Pergamum who at that time <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, having held the doctrine of Balaam? Nay, rather, <q>Repent therefore,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note304158"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse16">Revelation&nbsp;2:16</a></span> he says, <q>or else I come to you quickly, and I will make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against them with the sword of my mouth.</q></p>

<p>25. If, however, those men who were ordained by Hilary, and who have lately become sheep without a shepherd, are disposed to allege Scripture in support of what the blessed Cyprian  left in his letters advocating the re-baptization of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, I beg them to remember that he did not <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> those who refused to follow him. At all events, he remained in communion with such as opposed his views. He was content with exhorting them, on account of Novatus and the numerous other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> then springing up, to receive no one who did not condemn his previous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. In fact, he thus concludes the discussion of the subject with Stephen, the Roman Pontiff: <q>These things, dearest brother, I have brought to your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> on account of our mutual respect and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> unfeigned, believing, as I do, that from the sincerity of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> you will approve such things as are alike consonant with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in themselves. But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are unwilling to abandon views which they have once entertained, and are averse to a change of purpose; they would rather, without breaking the bond of peace and concord between colleagues, adhere to their own plans, when once they have been adopted. This is a matter in which we do not force anyone, or lay down a law for anyone; let each follow his own free choice in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: let each be ruler in his own sphere since he must give account of his action to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</q> In the letter also to Jubaianus on the re-baptization of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, towards the end, he says this: <q>I have written these few remarks, my dearest brother, to the best of my poor ability, without dictating to anyone, or prejudicing the case of anyone: I would not hinder a single <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from doing what he thinks right with the full exercise of his own judgment. So far as is possible, we avoid disputes with colleagues and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> about the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and maintain with them a divine harmony and the Lord's peace, particularly since the Apostle says: <span class="stiki" id="note304161"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:16</a></span> 'But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.' With patience and gentleness we preserve charity at heart, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of our order, the bond of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the harmony of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>.</q></p>

<p>26. There is another argument which I shall adduce, and against that not even Hilary,  the modern Deucalion, will venture to mutter a syllable. If <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and must be re-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> because they were not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Hilary himself also is not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. For he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in that Church which always allowed <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Before the Synod of Ariminum was held, before Lucifer went into exile, Hilary when a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the Roman Church welcomed those who came over from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> on account of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which they had previously received. It can hardly be that <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> are the only <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and that we are to accept all but those whom they have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. You were a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, Hilary (the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may say), and received those whom the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. You were a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and acknowledged Ebion's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. All at once after <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> arose you began to be quite out of conceit with yourself. You and your household separated from us, and opened a new laver of your own. If some <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> or apostle has re-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> you, I will not disparage your procedure. But since you who raise your sword against me are the son of my womb, and nourished on the milk of my breasts, return to me what I gave you, and be, if you can, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in some other way. Suppose I am a harlot, still I am your mother. You say, I do not keep the marriage bed undefiled: still what I am now I was when you were conceived. If I commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, I did the same before with Praxias, with Ebion, with <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>, and Novatus. You think much of them and welcome them, adulterers as they are, to your mother's home. I don't <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> why one adulterer more than others should offend you.</p>

<p>27. But if anyone thinks it open to question whether <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were always welcomed by our ancestors, let him read the letters of the blessed Cyprian in which he applies the lash to Stephen, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which had grown inveterate by usage.  Let him also read the pamphlets of Hilary on the re-baptization of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> which he published against us, and he will there find Hilary himself confessing that Julius, Marcus, Sylvester, and the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of old alike welcomed all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to repentance; and, further, to show that he could not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> claim possession of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> custom; the Council of Nic&aelig;a also, to which we referred not long ago, welcomed all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> with the exception of  the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>. And, what is more, it allows a <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on conversion to have the rank of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>,  a decision which condemns both Lucifer and Hilary, since the same person who is ordained is also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<p>28. I might spend the day in speaking to the same effect, and dry up all the streams of argument with the single Sun of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But as we have already had a long discussion and the protracted controversy has wearied out the attention of our audience, I will tell you my opinion briefly and without reserve. We ought to remain in that Church which was founded by the Apostles and continues to this day. If ever you hear of any that are called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> taking their name not from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, but from some other, for instance, Marcionites, <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a>, Men of the mountain or the plain,  you may be sure that you have there not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. For the fact that they took their rise after the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that they are those whose coming the Apostle foretold. And let them not flatter themselves if they think they have Scripture authority for their assertions, since the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself quoted Scripture, and the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> is not the letter, but the meaning. Otherwise, if we follow the letter, we too can concoct a new dogma and assert that such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as wear shoes and have two coats must not be received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>L. You must not suppose that victory rests with you only. We are both conquerors, and each of us carries off the palm&mdash;you are victorious over me, and I over my <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. May I always when I argue be so fortunate as to exchange wrong opinions for better ones. I must, however, make a confession, because I best <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the character of my party, and own that they are more easily conquered than convinced.</p>
