<h1>The Diatessaron (Section 13)</h1>

<p><span class="verse">1</span> <span class="stiki" id="note090951"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;10:16</a></span> I am sending you as lambs among wolves: be ye now wise as serpents, and <span class="verse">2</span> harmless  as doves. <span class="stiki" id="note090953"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;10:17</a></span> Beware of men: they shall deliver you to the councils of the <span class="verse">3</span> magistrates, and scourge you in their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note090954"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;10:18</a></span> and shall bring you before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and against the nations. <span class="verse">4</span> <span class="stiki" id="note090955"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;10:19</a></span> And when they deliver you up, be not  anxious, nor consider beforehand, what ye <span class="verse">5</span> shall say; but you shall be given  in that hour what ye ought to speak. <span class="stiki" id="note090958"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;10:20</a></span> You do not <span class="verse">6</span> speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaks in you. <span class="stiki" id="note090959"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;10:21</a></span> The brother shall deliver up his brother to death, and the father his son; and the sons shall rise against their <span class="verse">7</span> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and put them to death. <span class="stiki" id="note090960"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;10:22</a></span> And you shall be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> of every man because of <span class="verse">8</span> my name; but he that endures unto the end of the matter shall be saved.  <span class="stiki" id="note090962"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;10:23</a></span> When they expel you from this city, flee to another. Verily I say unto you, You shall not finish all the cities of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, until the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> come.</p>

<p><span class="verse">9, 10</span> <span class="stiki" id="note090963"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;10:24</a></span> A <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> is not superior to his lord, nor a servant to his master. <span class="stiki" id="note090964"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;10:25</a></span> For it is enough then for the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> that he be as his lord, and the servant as his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more the people <span class="verse">11</span> of his house! <span class="stiki" id="note090965"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;10:26</a></span> Fear them not therefore:  for there is nothing covered, that shall <span class="verse">12</span> [Arabic, p. 51] not be revealed; nor hid, that shall not be disclosed and published. What I say unto you in the darkness, speak ye in the light; and what you have told <span class="verse">13</span> secretly in the ears in closets, let it be proclaimed on the housetops. I say unto you now, my beloved, Be not agitated at  those who kill the body, but have no power to <span class="verse">14</span> kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. I will inform you whom you shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: him  which is able to destroy <span class="verse">15</span> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Yea, I say unto you, Be afraid of him especially. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing in a bond?  and one of them shall not fall on the <span class="verse">16</span> ground without your Father. <span class="stiki" id="note090973"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;10:30</a></span> But what concerns you: even the hair of your heads <span class="verse">17, 18</span> also is numbered. <span class="stiki" id="note090974"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;10:31</a></span> Fear not therefore; you are better than many sparrows. <span class="stiki" id="note090975"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;10:32</a></span> Every man who confesses me now before men, I also will confess him before my Father <span class="verse">19</span> which is in heaven; <span class="stiki" id="note090976"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;10:33</a></span> but whosoever denies me before men, I also will deny him before my Father which is in heaven.</p>

<p><span class="verse">27</span> <span class="stiki" id="note090986"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;10:40</a></span> And whosoever receives you receives me; and whosoever receives me receives <span class="verse">28</span> him that sent me. <span class="stiki" id="note090987"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;10:41</a></span> And whosoever receives a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in the name of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> shall take  a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> reward; and whosoever shall receive a righteous man <span class="verse">29</span> in the name of a righteous man shall take  a righteous man's reward. And every one that shall give to drink to one of these least ones a drink of water only, in the name of a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.</p>

<p><span class="verse">30</span> <span class="stiki" id="note090991"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;11:1</a></span> And when Jesus finished charging his twelve <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, he removed thence to <span class="verse">31</span> teach and preach in their cities. <span class="stiki" id="note090992"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;10:38</a></span> And while they were going in the way they entered into a certain village; and a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> named Martha entertained him in her house. <span class="verse">32</span> <span class="stiki" id="note090993"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;10:39</a></span> And she had a sister named Mary, and she came and sat at the feet of our Lord, <span class="verse">33</span> and heard his sayings. <span class="stiki" id="note090994"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse40">Luke&nbsp;10:40</a></span> But Martha was disquieted by much serving; and she came and said unto him, My Lord, do you give no heed that my sister left me alone to <span class="verse">34</span> serve? Speak to her that she help me. <span class="stiki" id="note090995"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;10:41</a></span> Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, <span class="verse">35</span> Martha, you are solicitous and impatient  on account of many things: <span class="stiki" id="note090997"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;10:42</a></span> but what is sought is one <em>thing</em>.
