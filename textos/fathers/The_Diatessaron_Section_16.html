<p><span class="verse">13</span> And while he was speaking unto the multitude, there came unto him his mother <span class="verse">14</span> and his brethren, and sought to speak with him; and they were not able, because of <span class="verse">15</span> the multitude; and they stood without and sent, calling him unto them. A man said unto him, Behold, your mother and your brethren <em>are</em> standing without, and seek to <span class="verse">16</span> speak with you. <span class="stiki" id="note091159"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse48">Matthew&nbsp;12:48</a></span> But he answered unto him that spoke unto him, Who is my <span class="verse">17</span> mother? And who are my brethren? <span class="stiki" id="note091160"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse49">Matthew&nbsp;22:49</a></span> And he beckoned with his hand, stretching it out towards his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and said, Behold, my mother!

<p><span class="verse">19</span> And after that, Jesus was going about in the cities and in the villages, and proclaiming [Arabic, p. 63] and preaching the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, and his  twelve with him, <span class="verse">20</span> <span class="stiki" id="note091164"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse2">Luke&nbsp;8:2</a></span> and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> which had been healed of diseases and of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, Mary <span class="verse">21</span> that <em>was</em> called Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven devils, <span class="stiki" id="note091165"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;8:3</a></span> and Joanna the wife of Chuza <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> steward, and Susanna, and many others, who were ministering to them of their substance.</p>

And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it; <span class="verse">29</span> and it yielded no fruit. And other fell into excellent <em>and</em> good  ground; and it came up, and grew, and brought forth fruit, some thirty, and some sixty, and some <span class="verse">30</span> a hundred. <span class="stiki" id="note091175"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;8:8</a>c</span> And when he said that, he cried, He that has ears that hear, let him <span class="verse">31</span> hear. And when they were alone, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came, and asked him, and said unto <span class="verse">32</span> him, What is this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>? And why did you speak to them in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>? He [Arabic, p. 64] answered and said unto them, Unto you is given the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the secrets of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>; but it is not given unto them that are <span class="verse">33</span> without. <span class="stiki" id="note091178"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;13:12</a></span> He that has shall be given unto, and there shall be added; and he that <span class="verse">34</span> has not, that which he has shall be taken from him also. <span class="stiki" id="note091179"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;13:13</a></span> For this <em><a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a></em> therefore I speak unto them in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>; because they see, and see not; and hear, and hear <span class="verse">35</span> not, nor understand. <span class="stiki" id="note091180"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;13:14</a></span> And in them is being fulfilled the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Isaiah, who said,</p>

<blockquote><p>Hearing they shall hear, and shall not understand;

<br>And seeing they shall see, and shall not perceive:

<br><span class="verse">36</span> <span class="stiki" id="note091181"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;13:15</a></span> The heart of this people has grown gross,

<br>And they have closed their eyes;

<br>Lest they should see with their eyes,

<br>And hear with their ears,

<br>And understand with their hearts,

<br>And should return,

<br>And I should heal them.
