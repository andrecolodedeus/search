<h1>The Diatessaron (Section 17)</h1>

<p><span class="verse">1</span> <span class="stiki" id="note091204"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;13:24</a></span> And he set forth to them another <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, and said, The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is <span class="verse">2</span> like a man who sowed good seed in his field; <span class="stiki" id="note091205"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;13:25</a></span> but when men slept, his enemy came <span class="verse">3</span> and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away. <span class="stiki" id="note091206"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;13:26</a></span> And when the blade sprang up <span class="verse">4</span> and brought forth fruit, there were noticed the tares also. <span class="stiki" id="note091207"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;13:27</a></span> And the servants of the master of the house came, and said unto him, Our lord, did you not sow good <span class="verse">5</span> [Arabic, p. 66] seed in your field? Whence are there tares in it? <span class="stiki" id="note091208"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;13:28</a></span> He said unto them, An enemy has done this. His servants said unto him, Will you that we go <span class="verse">6</span> and separate it? <span class="stiki" id="note091209"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;13:29</a></span> He said unto them, Perhaps,  when you separate the tares, you would <span class="verse">7</span> root up with them wheat also. <span class="stiki" id="note091211"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;13:30</a></span> Leave them to grow both together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say unto the reapers, Separate the tares first, and bind them in bundles to be burned with fire; and gather the wheat into my barns.</p>

<p><span class="verse">8, 9</span> <span class="stiki" id="note091212"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;13:31</a>a</span> And he set forth to them another <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, and said, <span class="stiki" id="note091213"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;13:18</a>b</span> To what is the kingdom of <span class="verse">10</span> God like? And to what shall I liken it? And in what <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> shall I set it forth? It <span class="verse">11</span> is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and planted in his field: and of the number of the things that are sown in the earth it is smaller than all of the things <span class="verse">12</span> which are sown, which are upon the earth; but when it is grown, it is greater than all the herbs, and produces large branches, so that the birds of heaven make <em>their</em> nests in its branches.</p>

<p><span class="verse">13, 14</span> And he set forth to them another <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note091218"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;13:20</a>b</span> To what shall I liken the kingdom of <span class="verse">15</span> God? <span class="stiki" id="note091219"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;13:33</a>b</span> It is like the leaven which a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> took, and kneaded into three measures of flour, until the whole of it was leavened.</p>

<p><span class="verse">16</span> And Jesus spoke all that to the multitudes by way of <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, according as they <span class="verse">17</span> were able to hear. And without <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> spoke he not unto them; that the saying of the Lord through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> might be fulfilled:</p>

<blockquote><p>I will open my mouth in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>;

<br>And I will utter secrets which were before the foundations  of the world.
