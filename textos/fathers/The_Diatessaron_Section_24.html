<h1>The Diatessaron (Section 24)</h1>

<p><span class="verse">1</span> <span class="stiki" id="note091679"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse1">Mark&nbsp;9:1</a></span> And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There be here now some standing that shall not taste death, until they see the kingdom of God come  with strength, <span class="stiki" id="note091681"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;16:28</a>b</span> and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> who comes in his kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="verse">2</span> <span class="stiki" id="note091682"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;17:1</a></span> And after six days Jesus took Simon Cephas, and James, and John his brother, <span class="verse">3</span> and brought them up into a high mountain, the three of them only. <span class="stiki" id="note091683"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;9:29</a>a</span> And while they <span class="verse">4</span> were <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, Jesus changed, and became after the fashion of another person; and his face shone like the sun, and his raiment was very white like the snow, and as <span class="verse">5</span> the light of lightning, so that nothing on earth can whiten  like it. And there appeared <span class="verse">6</span> unto him <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah talking to Jesus. <span class="stiki" id="note091687"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;9:31</a>b</span> And they thought that the time <span class="verse">7</span> of his decease which was to be accomplished at Jerusalem had come. <span class="stiki" id="note091688"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;9:32</a></span> And Simon and those that were with him were heavy in the drowsiness of sleep; and with effort they roused themselves, and saw his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and those two men that were standing with him. <span class="verse">8</span> [Arabic, p. 93] <span class="stiki" id="note091689"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;9:33</a>a</span> And when they began to depart from him, Simon said unto Jesus, My <span class="verse">9</span> Master, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for us to be here: <span class="stiki" id="note091690"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;17:4</a>b</span> and if you will, we will make here three tabernacles; one for you, and one for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and one for Elijah; <span class="stiki" id="note091691"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;9:33</a>c</span> not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <span class="verse">10</span> what he said, because of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> which took possession of them.

<p><span class="verse">17</span> <span class="stiki" id="note091699"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;17:9</a></span> And when they went down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, and said unto them, Tell not what you have seen to any man, until the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> rise from <span class="verse">18</span> among the dead. And they kept the word within themselves, and told no man in <span class="verse">19</span> those days what they had seen. <span class="stiki" id="note091701"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse10">Mark&nbsp;9:10</a>b</span> And they reflected among themselves, What is this <span class="verse">20</span> word which he spoke unto us, I, when I am risen from among the dead? And his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> asked him, and said, What is that which the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> say, then, that Elijah <span class="verse">21</span> must first come? <span class="stiki" id="note091703"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse12">Mark&nbsp;9:12</a></span> He said unto them, Elijah comes first to set in order everything, [Arabic, p. 94] and as it was written of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, that he should suffer many things, <span class="verse">22</span> and be rejected. <span class="stiki" id="note091704"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse13">Mark&nbsp;9:13</a></span> But I say unto you, that Elijah has come, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him not, and have done unto him whatsoever they desired, as it was written of him. <span class="verse">23, 24</span> <span class="stiki" id="note091705"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;17:12</a>b</span> In like manner the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is to suffer of them. <span class="stiki" id="note091706"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;17:13</a></span> Then understood the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that he spoke unto them concerning John the Baptist.</p>

<p><span class="verse">25</span> <span class="stiki" id="note091707"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse14">Mark&nbsp;9:14</a></span> And on that day whereon they came down from the mountain, there met him a multitude of many people standing with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> were discussing <span class="verse">26</span> with them. <span class="stiki" id="note091708"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse15">Mark&nbsp;9:15</a></span> And the people, when they saw Jesus, were perplexed,  and in the <span class="verse">27</span> midst of their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> hastened  and saluted him. <span class="stiki" id="note091711"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;13:31</a></span> And on that day came certain of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, and said unto him, Get you out, and go hence; for <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> seeks <span class="verse">28</span> to kill you. <span class="stiki" id="note091712"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;13:32</a></span> Jesus said unto them, Go ye and say to this fox, Behold, I am casting out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and I heal today and tomorrow, and on the third day I am perfected. <span class="verse">29</span> <span class="stiki" id="note091713"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;13:33</a></span> Nevertheless I must be watchful  today and tomorrow, and on the last day I shall depart; for it cannot be that a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> perish outside of Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="verse">30</span> And after that, there came to him a man from that multitude, and fell upon his knees, and said unto him, I beseech you, my Lord, look upon my son; <span class="stiki" id="note091716"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;9:38</a>b</span> he is my <span class="verse">31</span> only <em>child</em>: and the spirit comes upon him suddenly. A lunacy  has come upon <span class="verse">32</span> him, and he meets with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note091719"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse18">Mark&nbsp;9:18</a>a</span> And when it comes upon him, it beats him about;  <span class="verse">33</span> and he foams, and gnashes his teeth, and wasts;  and many times it has thrown him into the water and into the fire to destroy him, and it hardly leaves him after <span class="verse">34</span> [Arabic, p. 95] bruising him. <span class="stiki" id="note091723"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;17:16</a></span> And I brought him near to your <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and they could <span class="verse">35</span> not heal him. <span class="stiki" id="note091724"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;17:17</a></span> Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, till when shall I be with you? And till when shall I bear with you? Bring your son <span class="verse">36</span> hither. <span class="stiki" id="note091725"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse20">Mark&nbsp;9:20</a></span> And he brought him unto him: and when the spirit saw him, immediately <span class="verse">37</span> it beat him about; and he fell upon the ground, and was raging and foaming. <span class="stiki" id="note091726"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse21">Mark&nbsp;9:21</a></span> And Jesus asked his father, How long is the time during which he has been thus? He <span class="verse">38</span> said unto him, From his youth until now. <span class="stiki" id="note091727"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse22">Mark&nbsp;9:22</a>b</span> But, my Lord, help me wherein you <span class="verse">39</span> can, and have mercy upon me. <span class="stiki" id="note091728"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse23">Mark&nbsp;9:23</a></span> Jesus said unto him, If you can <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>! All <span class="verse">40</span> things are possible to him that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note091729"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse24">Mark&nbsp;9:24</a></span> And immediately the father of the child <span class="verse">41</span> cried out, weeping, and said, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, my Lord; help my lack of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note091730"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse25">Mark&nbsp;9:25</a></span> And when Jesus saw the hastening of the people, and their coming at the sound, he rebuked that unclean spirit, and said to it, You dumb  spirit that speaks not, I command <span class="verse">42</span> you,  come out of him, and enter not again into him. <span class="stiki" id="note091733"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse26">Mark&nbsp;9:26</a></span> And that spirit, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>,  cried out much, and bruised him, and came out; and that child fell as one dead, and <span class="verse">43</span> many thought that he had died. But Jesus took him by his hand, and raised him <span class="verse">44</span> up, and gave him to his father; and that child was healed from that hour. And the people all marvelled at the greatness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p><span class="verse">45</span> <span class="stiki" id="note091737"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse28">Mark&nbsp;9:28</a></span> And when Jesus entered into the house, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came, and asked him <span class="verse">46</span> privately,  and said unto him, Why were we not able to heal him? <span class="stiki" id="note091739"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;17:20</a></span> Jesus said unto [Arabic, p. 96] them, Because of your unbelief. Verily I say unto you, If you have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove hence; <span class="verse">47</span> and it shall remove; and nothing shall overcome you. <span class="stiki" id="note091740"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse29">Mark&nbsp;9:29</a>b</span> But it is impossible to cast out this kind by anything except by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>

<p><span class="verse">48</span> <span class="stiki" id="note091741"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse30">Mark&nbsp;9:30</a></span> And when he went forth thence, they passed through <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>: and he would not <span class="verse">49</span> that any man should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it.
