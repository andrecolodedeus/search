<p><span class="verse">10, 11</span> Jesus answered again in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, and said, <span class="stiki" id="note092067"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;14:16</a>b</span> The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> has been likened [Arabic, p. 115] to  a certain king, which made a feast  for his son, and prepared a <span class="verse">12</span> great banquet,  and invited many: and he sent his servants at the time of the feast to inform them that were invited, Everything is made ready for you; come. And <span class="verse">13</span> they would not come, but began all of them with one voice to make excuse. <span class="stiki" id="note092072"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;14:18</a></span> And the first said unto them, Say to him, I have bought a field, and I must needs go out <span class="verse">14</span> to see it: <span class="stiki" id="note092073"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;14:19</a></span> I pray you to release  me, for I ask to be excused. And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to examine them: I pray you <span class="verse">15</span> to release me, for I ask to be excused. <span class="stiki" id="note092075"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;14:20</a></span> And another said, I have married a wife, <span class="verse">16</span> and therefore I cannot come. <span class="stiki" id="note092076"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;22:4</a></span> And the king sent also other servants, and said, Say to those that were invited, that my feast is ready, and my oxen and my fatlings are <span class="verse">17</span> slain, and everything is ready: come to the feast. <span class="stiki" id="note092077"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;22:5</a></span> But they made light of it, and <span class="verse">18</span> went, one to his field, and another to his merchandise: <span class="stiki" id="note092078"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;22:6</a></span> and the rest took his <span class="verse">19</span> servants, and entreated them shamefully, and killed them. <span class="stiki" id="note092079"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;14:21</a>a</span> And one of the servants <span class="verse">20</span> came, and informed his lord of what had happened. <span class="stiki" id="note092080"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;22:7</a></span> And when the king heard, he became <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and sent his armies; and they destroyed those murderers, and <span class="verse">21</span> burned their cities. <span class="stiki" id="note092081"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;22:8</a></span> Then he said to his servants, The feast is prepared, but those <span class="verse">22</span> that were invited were not worthy. <span class="stiki" id="note092082"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;14:21</a>c</span> Go out quickly into the markets and into the partings of the ways of the city, and bring in hither the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and those with pains, and the lame, and the blind. And the servants did as the king commanded them. <span class="verse">23</span> <span class="stiki" id="note092083"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;14:22</a></span> And they came, and said unto him, Our lord, we have done all that you commanded <span class="verse">24</span> us, and there is here still room. So the lord said unto his servants, Go out into the roads, and the ways, and the paths, and every one that you find, invite <span class="verse">25</span> [Arabic, p. 116] to the feast, and constrain them to enter, till my house is  filled. I say unto you, that no one of those people that were invited shall taste of my feast. <span class="verse">26</span> <span class="stiki" id="note092087"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;22:10</a></span> And those servants went out into the roads, and gathered all that they found, good and <span class="verse">27</span> bad: and the banquet-house was filled with guests. <span class="stiki" id="note092088"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;22:11</a></span> And the king entered to see those <span class="verse">28</span> who were seated, and he saw there a man not wearing a festive garment: <span class="stiki" id="note092089"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;22:12</a></span> and he said unto him, My friend, how did you come in here not having on festive garments? <span class="verse">29</span> <span class="stiki" id="note092090"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;22:13</a></span> And he was silent. Then the king said to the servants, Bind his hands and his feet, and put him forth into the outer darkness; there shall be weeping and <span class="verse">30</span> gnashing of teeth. <span class="stiki" id="note092091"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;22:14</a></span> The called are many; and the chosen, few.</p>

And as he went in the way, there met him <span class="verse">33</span> ten <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who were <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, and stood afar off: <span class="stiki" id="note092094"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;17:13</a></span> and they lifted up their voice, and <span class="verse">34</span> said, Our Master, Jesus, have mercy upon us. <span class="stiki" id="note092095"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;17:14</a></span> And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go and show yourselves unto the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.
