<h1>The Diatessaron (Section 34)</h1>

<p><span class="verse">1</span> Then went the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> and considered how they might ensnare him in a word, <span class="verse">2</span> and deliver him into the power of the judge,  and into the power of the ruler. <span class="stiki" id="note092317"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;22:16</a></span> And they sent unto him their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, with the kinsfolk of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>; and they said unto him, [Arabic, p. 129] Teacher, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and teachest the way of God with equity,  and art not lifted up  by any man: for you act not so as to <span class="verse">3</span> be seen of any man. <span class="stiki" id="note092320"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;22:17</a></span> Tell us now, What is your opinion? Is it lawful that we should <span class="verse">4</span> pay the tribute to C&aelig;sar, or not? Shall we give, or shall we not give? <span class="stiki" id="note092321"><a href="../bible/mar012.htm#verse15">Mark&nbsp;12:15</a>a</span> But Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <span class="verse">5</span> their deceit, and said unto them, Why do you tempt me, you hypocrites? Show me the <span class="verse">6</span> penny of the tribute. <span class="stiki" id="note092323"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;22:20</a></span> So they brought unto him a penny. Jesus said unto them, To whom belongs this image and inscription? They said unto him, To C&aelig;sar. <span class="verse">7, 8</span> <span class="stiki" id="note092324"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;22:21</a></span> He said unto them, Give what is C&aelig;sar's to C&aelig;sar, and what is God's to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note092325"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;20:26</a></span> And they could not make him slip in a <em>single</em> word before the people; and they marvelled at his word, and refrained.</p>

<p><span class="verse">9</span> <span class="stiki" id="note092326"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;22:23</a></span> And on that day came the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, and said unto him,  There is no life for <span class="verse">10</span> the dead. <span class="stiki" id="note092328"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;22:24</a></span> And they asked him, and said unto him, Teacher, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said unto us, If a man die, not having children, let his brother take his wife, and raise up seed <span class="verse">11</span> for his brother. Now there <em>were</em> with us seven brethren: and the first took a wife, <span class="verse">12</span> and died without children; <span class="stiki" id="note092330"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;20:30</a></span> and the second took his wife, and died without children; <span class="verse">13</span> <span class="stiki" id="note092331"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;20:31</a></span> and the third also took her; and in like manner the seven of them also, and they <span class="verse">14, 15</span> died without leaving children. <span class="stiki" id="note092332"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;22:27</a></span> And last of them all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> died also. <span class="stiki" id="note092333"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;22:28</a></span> At the resurrection, then, which of these seven shall have this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? For all of them took <span class="verse">16</span> her. Jesus answered and said unto them, Is it not for this that you have erred, <span class="verse">17</span> because ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the scriptures, nor the power of God? <span class="stiki" id="note092335"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;20:34</a>b</span> And the sons of this <span class="verse">18</span> world take wives, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> become the men's;  <span class="stiki" id="note092337"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;20:35</a></span> but those that have become worthy of that world, and the resurrection from among the dead, do  not take <span class="verse">19</span> [Arabic, p. 130] wives, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also do  not become the men's. <span class="stiki" id="note092340"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse36">Luke&nbsp;20:36</a></span> Nor is it possible that they should die; but they  are like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and are the children of <span class="verse">20</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because they have become the children of the resurrection. For in  the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read in the book of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, how from the bush God said unto him, I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob? <span class="verse">21</span> And God is not <em>the God</em> of the dead, but of the living: for all of them are alive with him. And you have erred greatly.</p>

<p><span class="verse">22, 23</span> <span class="stiki" id="note092345"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;22:33</a></span> And when the multitudes heard, they were wondering at his teaching. <span class="stiki" id="note092346"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;20:39</a></span> And <span class="verse">24</span> some of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> answered and said unto him, Teacher, you have well said. <span class="stiki" id="note092347"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;22:34</a></span> But the rest of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, when they saw his silencing the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> on this point, gathered against him to contend with him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">25</span> And one of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, of those that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the law, when he saw the excellence <span class="verse">26</span> of his answer to them, desired to try him, and said unto him, <span class="stiki" id="note092349"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;10:25</a>b</span> What shall I do to inherit <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life?
