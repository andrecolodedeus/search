And when Jesus came to the place, he said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, Sit ye here, so that I may go and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; <span class="verse">4, 5</span> [Arabic, p. 181] and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> ye, that you enter not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. And he took with him Cephas and the sons of Zebedee together, James and John; and he began to <span class="verse">6</span> look sorrowful, and to be anxious. <span class="stiki" id="note093317"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;26:38</a></span> And he said unto them, My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is distressed unto <span class="verse">7</span> death: abide ye here, and watch with me. <span class="stiki" id="note093318"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;22:41</a>a</span> And he withdrew from them a little, <span class="verse">8</span> the space of a stone's throw; <span class="stiki" id="note093319"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse35">Mark&nbsp;14:35</a>b</span> and he kneeled,  and fell on his face, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, so <span class="verse">9</span> that, if it <em>were</em> possible, this hour <em>might</em> pass  him. <span class="stiki" id="note093322"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse36">Mark&nbsp;14:36</a>a</span> And he said, Father, you are able for all things; if you will, let this cup pass me: <span class="stiki" id="note093323"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;22:42</a>b</span> but let not my will be <em>done</em>, <span class="verse">10</span> but let your will be <em>done</em>. And he came to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and found them sleeping; <span class="verse">11</span> and he said unto Cephas, Simon, did you sleep? <span class="stiki" id="note093325"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;26:40</a>b</span> Could ye thus not for one hour <span class="verse">12</span> watch with me?

And he <span class="verse">20</span> said unto them, Sleep now, and rest: <span class="stiki" id="note093339"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse41">Mark&nbsp;14:41</a>b</span> the end has arrived,  and the hour has come; <span class="verse">21</span> and behold, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

And Judas the betrayer gave them a sign, and said, He whom I shall <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, he is he: take him with care,  and lead him <em>away</em>. </p>

<p><span class="verse">24</span> <span class="stiki" id="note093349"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;18:4</a>a</span> And Jesus, because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> everything that should come upon him, went forth <span class="verse">25</span> unto them. And immediately Judas the betrayer came to Jesus, and said, Peace, <span class="verse">26</span> my Master; and kissed him. <span class="stiki" id="note093351"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse48">Luke&nbsp;22:48</a>b</span> And Jesus said unto him, Judas, with a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> do you betray the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>?  <em>Was it</em> for that you came, my friend? And Jesus said <span class="verse">28</span> to those that came unto him, Whom do you seek? They said unto him, Jesus the Nazarene. Jesus said unto them, I am he. And Judas the betrayer also was standing <span class="verse">29</span> with them. <span class="stiki" id="note093354"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;18:6</a></span> And when Jesus said unto them, I am he, they retreated backward, and <span class="verse">30</span> fell to the ground. <span class="stiki" id="note093355"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse7">John&nbsp;18:7</a></span> And Jesus asked them again, Whom do you seek?

<p><span class="verse">34</span> <span class="stiki" id="note093359"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;22:49</a></span> And when his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> saw what happened, they said, Our Lord, shall we smite <span class="verse">35</span> them with swords? <span class="stiki" id="note093360"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;18:10</a></span> And Simon Cephas had a sword, and he drew it, and struck the servant of the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and cut off his right ear.

And in that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, As they come out against a thief are you come out against me with swords and staves to take me? Daily was I with you in <span class="verse">42</span> the temple sitting teaching, and you took me not: <span class="stiki" id="note093371"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse53">Luke&nbsp;22:53</a>b</span> but this is your hour, and the power <span class="verse">43</span> of darkness. <span class="stiki" id="note093372"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse56">Matthew&nbsp;26:56</a></span> And that was, that the scriptures of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> might be fulfilled.</p>

Then they took Jesus, and bound him, and brought him to <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> first; because he was the father in law of <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, <span class="verse">48</span> who was chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> that year. <span class="stiki" id="note093379"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;18:14</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> was he that counselled the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that it was necessary that one man should die instead of the people.</p>
