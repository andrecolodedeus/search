And after a little one of the servants of the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the kinsman of him whose ear Simon cut off, saw him; and <span class="verse">12</span> he disputed  and said, Truly this <em>man</em> was with him: <span class="stiki" id="note093403"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse59">Luke&nbsp;22:59</a>b</span> and he also is a Galil&aelig;an; <span class="verse">13</span> and his speech resembles.

And Simon remembered the word of our Lord, which he said unto him, <span class="verse">17, 18</span> Before the cock crow twice, you shall deny me thrice. <span class="stiki" id="note093411"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse62">Luke&nbsp;22:62</a></span> And Simon went forth without, and wept bitterly.</p>

And not even so did their <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> agree. But Jesus was silent. <span class="stiki" id="note093421"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse60">Mark&nbsp;14:60</a>a</span> And the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> rose in the midst, and asked Jesus, and said, <span class="verse">28</span> <span class="stiki" id="note093422"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse62">Matthew&nbsp;26:62</a>b</span> Do you answer not a word concerning anything?

Then the <span class="verse">38</span> chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> rent his tunic,  and said, He has <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note093435"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse71">Luke&nbsp;22:71</a></span> And they all said, Why should we seek now witnesses?

Then some of them drew near, and spat in his face, and struck him, and scoffed at him. <span class="verse">41</span> And the soldiers struck him on his cheeks,  and said, Prophesy unto us, <em>you</em> Messiah: <span class="verse">42</span> who is he that struck you? <span class="stiki" id="note093440"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse65">Luke&nbsp;22:65</a></span> And many other things spoke they <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>,  and said against him.</p>

<p><span class="verse">43</span> And all of their assembly arose,  and took Jesus, and brought him bound  to <span class="verse">44</span> the pr&aelig;torium,  and delivered him up to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> the judge; <span class="stiki" id="note093446"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;18:28</a>c</span> but they entered not into the pr&aelig;torium, that they might not be defiled when they should eat the passover.</p>
