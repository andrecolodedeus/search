<h1>The Diatessaron (Section 54)</h1>

<p><span class="verse">1</span> And while they talked together,  the evening of that day arrived which was the First-day; and the doors were shut where the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were, because of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <span class="verse">2</span> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note093785"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse36">Luke&nbsp;24:36</a>c</span> and Jesus came and stood among them, and said unto them, Peace <em>be</em> with you: I am he; <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not. <span class="stiki" id="note093786"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse37">Luke&nbsp;24:37</a></span> But they were agitated, and became afraid, and supposed that they <span class="verse">3</span> saw a spirit. <span class="stiki" id="note093787"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;24:38</a></span> Jesus said unto them, Why are you agitated?

He <span class="verse">7</span> said unto them, Have ye anything here to eat? <span class="stiki" id="note093793"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;24:42</a></span> And they gave him a portion of broiled fish and of honey.  <span class="stiki" id="note093795"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;24:43</a></span> And he took <em>it</em>, and ate before them.</p>

<p><span class="verse">8</span> <span class="stiki" id="note093796"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse44">Luke&nbsp;24:44</a></span> And he said unto them, These are the sayings which I spoke unto you, while I was with you, that  everything must be fulfilled, which is written in the law of <span class="verse">9</span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the psalms, concerning me. <span class="stiki" id="note093798"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse45">Luke&nbsp;24:45</a></span> Then opened he their <span class="verse">10</span> heart, that they might understand the scriptures; and he said unto them, <span class="stiki" id="note093799"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;24:46</a></span> Thus it is written, and thus it is necessary  that the Messiah suffer, and rise from among the <span class="verse">11</span> dead on the third day; <span class="stiki" id="note093801"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;24:47</a></span> and <em>that</em> repentance unto the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be preached <span class="verse">12</span> in his name among all the peoples; and the beginning shall be from Jerusalem. <span class="stiki" id="note093802"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse48">Luke&nbsp;24:48</a></span> And <span class="verse">13</span> you shall be witnesses of that. And I send unto you the promise of my Father. And <span class="verse">14</span> when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> heard that, they were glad. <span class="stiki" id="note093804"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse21">John&nbsp;20:21</a></span> And Jesus said unto them again, <span class="verse">15</span> Peace <em>be</em> with you: as my Father has sent me, I also send you. <span class="stiki" id="note093805"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;20:22</a></span> And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said unto them, Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>: <span class="verse">16</span> <span class="stiki" id="note093806"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;20:23</a></span> and if you forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to <em>any</em> man, they shall be forgiven him; and if you retain them against <em>any</em> man, they shall be retained.</p>

But he said unto them, If I do not see in his hands the places of the nails, and put on them my fingers, and pass my hand over his side, I will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</p>

<p><span class="verse">19</span> <span class="stiki" id="note093809"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;20:26</a></span> And after eight days, on the next First-day, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were assembled again within, and Thomas with them. And Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood <span class="verse">20</span> [Arabic, p. 206] in the midst, and said unto them, Peace <em>be</em> with you. <span class="stiki" id="note093810"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;20:27</a></span> And he said to Thomas, Bring hither your finger, and behold my hands; and bring <em>hither</em> <span class="verse">21</span> your hand, and spread it on my side: and be not unbelieving, but believing. <span class="stiki" id="note093811"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;20:28</a></span> Thomas <span class="verse">22</span> answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. <span class="stiki" id="note093812"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;20:29</a></span> Jesus said unto him, Now since you have seen me, you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: blessed are they that have not seen me, and have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</p>

And no man of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> dared to ask him who he was, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it was our Lord. But he did not appear to them in his <em>own</em> <span class="verse">37, 38</span> form. <span class="stiki" id="note093832"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;21:13</a></span> And Jesus came, and took bread and fish, and gave unto them. <span class="stiki" id="note093833"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;21:14</a></span> This is the third time that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> appeared to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, when he had risen from among the dead.</p>
