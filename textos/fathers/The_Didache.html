<h1>The Didache</h1>

<p></p>
<p class="h1a">The Lord's Teaching Through the Twelve Apostles to the Nations. </p>

<h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1. The Two Ways; The First Commandment</h2>

<p>There are two ways,  one of life and one of death;  but a great difference between the two ways. The way of life, then, is this: First, you shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God  who made you; second, your neighbour as yourself;  and all things whatsoever you would should not occur to you, do not also do to another.  And of these sayings  the teaching is this: Bless those who curse you, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for your enemies, and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> for those who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you.  For what reward is there, if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you? Do not also the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> do the same?  But <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you, and you shall not have an enemy.  Abstain from fleshly and worldly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.  If someone gives you a blow upon your right cheek, turn to him the other also,  and you shall be <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a>. If someone impresses you for one mile, go with him two.  If someone takes away your cloak, give him also your coat.  If someone takes from you what is yours, ask it not back,  for indeed you are not able. Give to every one that asks you, and ask it not back;  for the Father wills that to all should be given of our own blessings (free gifts).  Happy is he that gives according to the commandment; for he is guiltless. Woe to him that receives; for if one having need receives, he is guiltless; but he that receives not having need, shall pay the penalty, why he received and for what, and, coming into straits (confinement),  he shall be examined concerning the things which he has done, and he shall not escape thence until he pay back the last farthing. <span class="stiki" id="note072387"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;5:26</a></span> But also now concerning this, it has been said, Let your <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> sweat  in your hands, until you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to whom you should give.</p>

<h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2. The Second Commandment: Gross Sin Forbidden</h2> 

<p>And the second commandment of the Teaching; You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, you shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note072390"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse13">Exodus&nbsp;20:13-14</a></span> you shall not commit pederasty,  you shall not commit fornication, you shall not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">steal</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note072392"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse15">Exodus&nbsp;20:15</a></span> you shall not practice <a href="../cathen/11197b.htm">magic</a>, you shall not practice <a href="../cathen/15674b.htm">witchcraft</a>, you shall not <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> a child by <a href="../cathen/01046b.htm">abortion</a> nor kill that which is begotten.  You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> the things of your neighbour, <span class="stiki" id="note072394"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse17">Exodus&nbsp;20:17</a></span> you shall not forswear yourself, <span class="stiki" id="note072395"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;5:34</a></span> you shall not bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note072396"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse16">Exodus&nbsp;20:16</a></span> you shall not speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, you shall bear no grudge.  You shall not be double-minded nor double-tongued; for to be double-tongued is a  snare of death.  Your speech shall not be false, nor empty, but fulfilled by deed.  You shall not be <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, nor rapacious, nor a hypocrite, nor <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> disposed, nor <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a>. You shall not take <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsel against your neighbour.  You shall not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> any man; but some you shall reprove,  and concerning some you shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and some you shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> more than your own life. </p>

<h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3. Other Sins Forbidden</h2> 

<p>My child,  flee from every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing, and from every likeness of it. Be not prone to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, for <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> leads the way to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>; neither jealous, nor quarrelsome, nor of hot temper; for out of all these murders are engendered. My child, be not a lustful one; for <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> leads the way to fornication; neither a filthy talker, nor of lofty eye; for out of all these adulteries are engendered. My child, be not an observer of omens, since it leads the way to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; neither an enchanter, nor an astrologer, nor a purifier, nor be willing to took at these things; for out of all these <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is engendered. My child, be not a liar, since a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> leads the way to theft; neither money-loving, nor vainglorious, for out of all these thefts are engendered. My child, be not a murmurer, since it leads the way to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; neither self-willed nor evil-minded, for out of all these <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> are engendered. But be meek, since the meek shall inherit the earth. <span class="stiki" id="note072405"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;5:5</a></span> Be long-suffering and pitiful and guileless and gentle and good and always trembling at the words which you have heard.  You shall not exalt yourself, <span class="stiki" id="note072407"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;18:14</a></span> nor give over-confidence to your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall not be joined with lofty ones, but with just and lowly ones shall it have its intercourse. The workings that befall you receive as good, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that apart from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nothing comes to pass. </p>

<h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4. Various Precepts</h2> 

<p>My child, him that speaks to you the word of God remember night and day; and you shall <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him as the Lord;  for in the place whence lordly rule is uttered,  there is the Lord. And you shall seek out day by day the faces of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in order that you may rest upon  their words. You shall not long for  division, but shall bring those who contend to peace. You shall judge righteously, you shall not respect <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in reproving for transgressions. You shall not be undecided whether it shall be or no.  Be not a stretcher forth of the hands to receive and a drawer of them back to give.  If you have anything, through your hands you shall give ransom for your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.  You shall not hesitate to give, nor murmur when you give; for you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who is the good repayer of the hire. You shall not turn away from him that is in want, but you shall share all things with your brother, and shall not say that they are your own; for if you are partakers in that which is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, how much more in things which are mortal?  You shall not remove your hand from your son or from your daughter, but from their youth shall teach them the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note072418"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse4">Ephesians&nbsp;6:4</a></span> You shall not enjoin anything in your bitterness upon your bondman or maidservant, who <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lest ever they shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not God who is over both; <span class="stiki" id="note072419"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse9">Ephesians&nbsp;6:9</a>; <a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse1">Colossians&nbsp;4:1</a></span> for he comes not to call according to the outward appearance, but unto them whom the Spirit has prepared. And you bondmen shall be subject to your  masters as to a type of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in modesty and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note072421"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;6:5</a>; <a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse22">Colossians&nbsp;3:22</a></span> You shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> all hypocrisy and everything which is not pleasing to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Forsake in no way the commandments of the Lord; but you shall keep what you have received, neither adding thereto nor taking away therefrom . <span class="stiki" id="note072422"><a href="../bible/deu012.htm#verse32">Deuteronomy&nbsp;12:32</a></span> In the church  you shall acknowledge your transgressions, and you shall not come near for your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>  with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.  This is the way of life. </p>

<p></p>
<h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5. The Way of Death</h2> 

<p>And the way of death  is this: First of all it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and full of curse:  murders,  adulteries, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, fornications, thefts, idolatries, magic arts, witchcrafts, rapines, false witnessings, hypocrisies, double-heartedness, deceit, haughtiness, depravity, self-will, greediness, filthy talking, jealousy, over-confidence, loftiness, boastfulness; persecutors of the good,  hating <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, loving a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> a reward for righteousness, not cleaving  to good nor to righteous judgment, watching not for that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but for that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; from whom meekness and endurance are far, loving vanities, pursuing requital, not pitying a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man, not labouring for the afflicted, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> Him that made them, murderers of children, destroyers of the handiwork of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, turning away from him that is in want, afflicting him that is distressed, advocates of the rich, lawless judges of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, utter sinners.  Be delivered, children, from all these. </p>

<h2 id="chapter6">Chapter 6. Against False Teachers, and Food Offered to Idols</h2> 

<p>See that no one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>  from this way of the Teaching, since apart from God it teaches you. For if you are able to bear all the yoke  of the Lord, you will be perfect; but if you are not able, what you are able that do. And concerning food,  bear what you are able; but against that which is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>  be exceedingly on your guard; for it is the service of dead gods. </p>

<h2 id="chapter7">Chapter 7. Concerning Baptism</h2>

<p>And concerning <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>,  <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> this way:  Having first said all these things, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> into the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note072443"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> in living water.  But if you have not living water, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> into other water; and if you can not in cold, in warm. But if you have not either, pour out water thrice  upon the head into the name of Father and Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But before the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> let the baptizer fast, and the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and whatever others can; but you shall order the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> to fast one or two days before. </p>

<h2 id="chapter8">Chapter 8. Concerning Fasting and Prayer (the Lord's Prayer)</h2> 

<p>But let not your <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> be with the hypocrites; <span class="stiki" id="note072448"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;6:16</a></span> for they fast on the second and fifth day of the week; but fast on the fourth day and the Preparation (Friday).  Neither <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> as the hypocrites; but as the Lord commanded in His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>,  thus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth. Give us today our daily (needful) bread,  and forgive us our debt as we also forgive our debtors. And bring us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, but deliver us from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one (or, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>); for Yours is the power and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever.  Thrice in the day thus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. </p>

<h2 id="chapter9">Chapter 9. The Thanksgiving (Eucharist)</h2> 

<p>Now concerning the Thanksgiving (<a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>), thus give thanks. First, concerning the cup:  We thank you, our Father, for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> vine of David Your servant,  which You made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us through Jesus Your Servant; to You be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever. And concerning the broken bread:  We thank You, our Father, for the life and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which You made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us through Jesus Your Servant; to You be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever. Even as this broken bread was scattered over the hills,  and was gathered together and became one, so let Your Church be gathered together from the ends of the earth into Your kingdom;  for Yours is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the power through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> for ever. But let no one eat or drink of your Thanksgiving (<a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>), but they who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into the name of the Lord; for concerning this also the Lord has said, Give not that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to the dogs. <span class="stiki" id="note072460"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span> </p>

<h2 id="chapter10">Chapter 10. Prayer After Communion</h2> 

<p>But after you are filled,  thus give thanks: We thank You, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Father, for Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name which You caused to tabernacle in our hearts, and for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, which You made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us through Jesus Your Servant; to You be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever. You, Master almighty, created all things for Your name's sake; You gave food and drink to men for enjoyment, that they might give thanks to You; but to us You freely gave spiritual food and drink and life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> through Your Servant.  Before all things we thank You that You are mighty; to You be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever. Remember, Lord, Your Church, to deliver it from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and to make it perfect in Your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and gather it from the four winds, sanctified for Your kingdom which You have prepared for it;  for Yours is the power and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever. Let <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> come, and let this world pass away.  <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> to the God (Son)  of David! If any one is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, let him come; if any one is not so, let him repent.  Maran atha.  <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. But permit the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to make Thanksgiving as much as they desire. </p>

<h2 id="chapter11">Chapter 11. Concerning Teachers, Apostles, and Prophets</h2> 

<p>Whosoever, therefore, comes and teaches you all these things that have been said before, receive him.  But if the teacher himself turn  and teach another doctrine to the destruction of this, hear him not; but if he teach so as to increase righteousness and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Lord, receive him as the Lord. But concerning the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, according to the decree of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, thus do. Let every apostle that comes to you be received as the Lord.  But he shall not remain except one day; but if there be need, also the next; but if he remain three days, he is a <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a>. And when the apostle goes away, let him take nothing but bread until he lodges;  but if he ask money, he is a <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a>. And every <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> that speaks in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>  you shall neither try nor judge; for every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall be forgiven, but this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall not be forgiven.  But not every one that speaks in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; but only if he hold the ways of the Lord. Therefore from their ways shall the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. And every <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> who orders a meal  in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> eats not from it, except indeed he be a <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a>; and every <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> who teaches the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, if he do not what he teaches, is a <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a>. And every <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>,  working unto the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the world,  yet not teaching others to  do what he himself does, shall not be judged among you, for with God he has his judgment; for so did also the ancient <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. But whoever says in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, Give me money, or something else, you shall not listen to him; but if he says to you to give for others' sake who are in need, let no one judge him.</p>

<h2 id="chapter12">Chapter 12. Reception of Christians</h2> 

<p>But let every one that comes in the name of the Lord be received,  and afterward you shall prove and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him; for you shall have understanding right and left. If he who comes is a wayfarer, assist him as far as you are able; but he shall not remain with you, except for two or three days, if need be. But if he wills to abide with you, being an artisan, let him work and eat; <span class="stiki" id="note072482"><a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;3:10</a></span> but if he has no trade, according to your understanding see to it that, as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>,  he shall not live with you idle. But if he wills not to do, he is a Christ-monger.  Watch that you keep aloof from such.</p>

<h2 id="chapter13">Chapter 13. Support of Prophets</h2> 

<p>But every <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> that wills to abide among you  is worthy of his support.  So also a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> teacher is himself worthy, as the workman, of his support. <span class="stiki" id="note072488"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;10:10</a>;&nbsp;cf.&nbsp;<a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;10:7</a></span> Every first-fruit, therefore, of the products of wine-press and threshing-floor, of oxen and of sheep, you shall take and give to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, for they are your <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a>.  But if you have not a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, give it to the poor. If you make a batch of dough, take the first-fruit and give according to the commandment. So also when you open a jar of wine or of oil, take the first-fruit and give it to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and of money (silver) and clothing and every possession, take the first-fruit, as it may seem good to you, and give according to the commandment.</p>

<h2 id="chapter14">Chapter 14. Christian Assembly on the Lord's Day</h2> 

<p>But every Lord's day  gather yourselves together, and break bread, and give thanksgiving after having confessed your transgressions,  that your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> may be pure.  But let no one that is at variance  with his fellow come together with you, until they be reconciled, that your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> may not be profaned. For this is that which was spoken by the Lord: In every place and time offer to me a pure <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>;  for I am a great King, says the Lord, and my name is wonderful among the nations. </p>

<h2 id="chapter15">Chapter 15. Bishops and Deacons; Christian Reproof</h2> 

<p>Therefore, appoint for yourselves <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> worthy of the Lord, men meek, and not lovers of money, <span class="stiki" id="note072498"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:4</a></span> and truthful and proven; for they also render to you the service  of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and teachers. Despise them not therefore, for they are your honoured ones, together with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and teachers. And reprove one another, not in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but in peace, as you have it in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note072500"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;18:15-17</a></span> but to every one that acts amiss  against another, let no one speak, nor let him hear anything from you until he repents. But your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> and all your <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> so do, as you have it in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of our Lord. </p>

<p></p>
<h2 id="chapter16">Chapter 16. Watchfulness; The Coming of the Lord</h2> 

<p>Watch for your life's sake.  Let not your lamps be quenched, nor your loins unloosed;  but be ready, for you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the hour in which our Lord comes. <span class="stiki" id="note072506"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse42">Matthew&nbsp;24:42</a></span> But often shall you come together, seeking the things which are befitting to your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: for the whole time of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will not profit you,  if you be not made perfect in the last time. For in the last days  <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> and corrupters shall be multiplied, and the sheep shall be turned into wolves, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> shall be turned into <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note072509"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;24:11-12</a></span> for when lawlessness increases, they shall <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> and betray one another, <span class="stiki" id="note072510"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;24:10</a></span> and then shall appear the <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">world-deceiver</a>  as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,  and shall do signs and wonders,  and the earth shall be delivered into his hands, and he shall do iniquitous things which have never yet come to pass since the beginning. Then shall the creation of men come into the fire of trial,  and many shall be made to stumble and shall perish; but they that endure in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> shall be saved  from under the curse itself.  And then shall appear the signs of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;  first, the sign of an outspreading  in heaven; then the sign of the sound of the trumpet; and the third, the resurrection of the dead; yet not of all, but as it is said: The Lord shall come and all His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> with Him.  Then shall the world see the Lord coming upon the clouds of heaven. </p>
