<h1>The Epistle of Ignatius to Polycarp</h1>

<h2>Greeting</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, who is also called Theophorus, to <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, Bishop of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Smyrn&aelig;ans, or rather, who has, as his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>: [wishes] abundance of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1. Commendation and exhortation</h2>

<p>Having obtained good <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that your mind is fixed in God as upon an immoveable rock, I loudly glorify [His name] that I have been thought worthy [to behold] your blameless face,  which may I ever enjoy in God! I entreat you, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> with which you are clothed, to press forward in your course, and to exhort all that they may be saved. Maintain your position with all care, both in the flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>. Have a regard to preserve unity, than which nothing is better. Bear with all, even as the Lord does with you. Support  all in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, as also you do. Give yourself to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> without ceasing. <span class="stiki" id="note011065"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> Implore additional understanding to what you already have. Be watchful, possessing a sleepless spirit. Speak to every man separately, as God enables you.  Bear the infirmities of all, as being a perfect athlete [in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life]: where the labour is great, the gain is all the more.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Exhortations</h2>

<p>If you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the good <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, no thanks are due to you on that account; but rather seek by meekness to subdue the more troublesome. Every kind of wound is not healed with the same plaster. Mitigate violent  attacks [of disease] by gentle applications.  Be in all things <q>wise as a serpent, and harmless as a dove.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011073"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;10:16</a></span> For this purpose you are composed of both flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, that you may deal tenderly  with those [<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>] that present themselves visibly before you. And as respects those that are not seen,  <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that [God] would reveal them unto you, in order that you may be wanting in nothing, but may abound in every gift. The times call for you, as pilots do for the winds, and as one tossed with tempest seeks for the haven, so that both you [and those under your care] may attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Be sober as an athlete of God: the prize set before you is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, of which you are also persuaded. In all things may my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be for yours,  and my bonds also, which you have loved.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Exhortations</h2>

<p>Let not those who seem worthy of credit, but teach <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">strange doctrines</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note011080"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:3</a>,&nbsp;<a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:3</a></span> fill you with apprehension. Stand firm, as does an anvil which is beaten. It is the part of a noble  athlete to be wounded, and yet to conquer. And especially, we ought to bear all things for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He also may bear with us. Be ever becoming more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> than what you are. Weigh carefully the times. Look for Him who is above all <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and invisible, yet who became visible for our sakes; impalpable and impassible, yet who became passible on our account; and who in every kind of way suffered for our sakes.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Exhortations</h2>

<p>Let not <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> be neglected. Be, after the Lord, their protector  and friend. Let nothing be done without your consent; neither do anything without the approval of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which indeed you do not, inasmuch as you are steadfast. Let your assembling together be of frequent  occurrence: seek after all by name.  Do not despise either male or female slaves, yet neither let them be puffed up with conceit, but rather let them  submit themselves  the more, for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that they may obtain from God a better liberty. Let them not long to be set free [from slavery] at the public expense, that they be not found slaves to their own desires.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. The duties of husbands and wives</h2>

<p>Flee <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> arts; but all the more discourse in public regarding them.  Speak to my sisters, that they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord, and be satisfied with their husbands both in the flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>. In like manner also, exhort my brethren, in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, that they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their wives, even as the Lord the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note011092"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse25">Ephesians&nbsp;5:25</a></span> If any one can continue in a state of purity,  to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Him who is Lord of the flesh,  let him so remain without boasting. If he begins to boast, he is undone; and if he reckon himself greater than the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he is ruined. But it becomes both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who marry, to form their union with the approval of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, that their marriage may be according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not after their own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Let all things be done to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note011095"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:31</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 6. The duties of the Christian flock</h2>

<p>Give  heed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, that God also may give heed to you. My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be for theirs  that are submissive to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and may my portion be along with them in God! Labour together with one another; strive in company together; run together; suffer together; sleep together; and awake together, as the stewards, and associates,  and servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Please Him under whom you fight, and from whom you receive your wages. Let none of you be found a deserter. Let your <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> endure as your arms; your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as your helmet; your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> as your spear; your patience as a complete panoply. Let your works be the charge  assigned to you, that you may receive a worthy recompense. Be long-suffering, therefore, with one another, in meekness, as God is towards you. May I have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of you for ever! </p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Request that Polycarp would send a messenger to Antioch</h2>

<p>Seeing that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> is, as report has informed me, at peace, through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, I also am the more encouraged, resting without anxiety in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  if indeed by means of suffering I may attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that, through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, I may be found a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> [of Christ].  It is fitting, O <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, most <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to assemble a very solemn  council, and to elect one whom you greatly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be a man of activity, who may be designated the messenger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;  and to bestow on him this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> that he may go into <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and glorify your ever active <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the praise of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. A <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> has not power over himself, but must always be ready for  the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Now, this work is both God's and yours, when you shall have completed it to His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.  For I trust that, through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, you are prepared for every good work pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a>, therefore, your energetic <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I have exhorted you by this brief Epistle.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Let other churches also send to Antioch</h2>

<p>Inasmuch as I have not been able to write to all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, because I must suddenly sail from <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a> to Neapolis, as the will  [of the emperor] enjoins, [I beg that] you, as being acquainted with the purpose  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, will write to the adjacent Churches, that they also may act in like manner, such as are able to do so sending messengers,  and the others transmitting letters through those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are sent by you, that you  may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by a work  which shall be remembered for ever, as indeed you are worthy to be. I salute all by name, and in particular the wife of Epitropus, with all her house and children. I salute Attalus, my beloved. I salute him who shall be deemed worthy to go [from you] into <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Grace shall be with him for ever, and with <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> that sends him. I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> for ever in our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, by whom continue in the unity and under the protection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  I salute Alce, my dearly beloved.  Fare well in the Lord.</p>
