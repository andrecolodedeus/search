<h1>The Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians</h1>

<h2 class="chapter0">Greeting</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, who is also called Theophorus, to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is at <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>, deservedly most <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, being <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the greatness and fullness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestinated</a> before the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, that it should be always for an enduring and unchangeable <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, being united  and elected through the true <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: Abundant <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and His undefiled <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter1">Chapter 1. Praise of the Ephesians</h2>

<p>I have become acquainted with your name, much-beloved in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which you have acquired by the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of righteousness, according to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ our Saviour</a>. Being the followers  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and stirring up  yourselves by the blood of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have perfectly accomplished the work which was beseeming to you. For, on hearing that I came bound from <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> for the common name and <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, trusting through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to be permitted to fight with beasts at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that so by <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> I may indeed become the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Him <q>who gave Himself for us, an <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010492"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;5:2</a></span> [you hastened to see me ]. I received, therefore,  your whole multitude in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through Onesimus, a man of inexpressible <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,  and your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the flesh, whom I pray you by Jesus Christ to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and that you would all seek to be like him. And <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> be He who has granted unto you, being worthy, to obtain such an excellent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter2">Chapter 2. Congratulations and entreaties</h2>

<p>As to my fellow-servant Burrhus, your <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in regard to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in all things,  I beg that he may continue longer, both for your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and that of your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. And Crocus also, worthy both of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and you, whom I have received as the manifestation  of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, has in all things refreshed <span class="stiki" id="note010503"><a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;16:18</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> me, as the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> shall also refresh <span class="stiki" id="note010504"><a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;16:18</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> him; together with Onesimus, and Burrhus, and Euplus, and Fronto, by means of whom, I have, as to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, beheld all of you. May I always have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of you, if indeed I be worthy of it. It is therefore befitting that you should in every way glorify <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who has glorified you, that by a unanimous <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> <q>you may be perfectly joined together in the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">same mind</a>, and in the same judgment, and may all speak the same thing concerning the same thing,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010505"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:10</a></span> and that, being subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a>, you may in all respects be sanctified.</p>

<h2 class="chapter3">Chapter 3. Exhortations to unity</h2>

<p>I do not issue orders to you, as if I were some great person. For though I am bound for the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name [of Christ]</a>, I am not yet <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. For now I begin to be a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, and I speak to you as fellow-disciples with me. For it was needful for me to have been stirred up by you in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, exhortation, patience, and long-suffering. But inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> suffers me not to be silent in regard to you, I have therefore taken  upon me first to exhort you that you would all run together in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our inseparable life, is the [manifested] <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father; as also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, settled everywhere to the utmost bounds [of the earth], are so by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter4">Chapter 4. The same continued</h2>

<p>Wherefore it is fitting that you should run together in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, which thing also you do. For your justly renowned <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a>, worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is fitted as exactly to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as the strings are to the harp. Therefore in your  concord and harmonious <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is sung. And man by man, become a <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a>, that being harmonious in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and taking up the song of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in unison, you may with one voice sing to the Father through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, so that He may both hear you, and perceive by your <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> that you are indeed the members of His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. It is profitable, therefore, that you should live in an unblameable <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity</a>, that thus you may always enjoy communion with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter5">Chapter 5. The praise of unity</h2>

<p>For if I in this brief space of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, have enjoyed such fellowship with your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> &mdash; I mean not of a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but of a <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> nature&mdash; how much more do I reckon you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> who are so joined to him as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is to the Father, that so all things may agree in <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity</a>! Let no man deceive himself: if any one be not within the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, he is deprived of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">bread of God</a>. For if the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of one or two possesses <span class="stiki" id="note010518"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;18:19</a></span> such power, how much more that of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>! He, therefore, that does not <a href="../cathen/14383a.htm">assemble</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, has even  by this manifested his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and condemned himself. For it is written, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> resists the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>.</q>  Let us be careful, then, not to set ourselves in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, in order that we may be subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter6">Chapter 6. Have respect to the bishop as to Christ Himself</h2>

<p>Now the more any one sees the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> keeping silence,  the more ought he to revere him. For we ought to receive every one whom the Master of the house sends to be over His household, <span class="stiki" id="note010528"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;24:25</a></span> as we would do Him that sent him. It is manifest, therefore, that we should look upon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> even as we would upon the  <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> Himself. And indeed Onesimus himself greatly commends your good order in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you all live according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and that no <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>  has any dwelling-place among you. Nor, indeed, do you hearken to any one rather than to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> speaking in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter7">Chapter 7. Beware of false teachers</h2>

<p>For some are in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of carrying about the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name [of Jesus Christ]</a> in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> guile, while yet they practise things unworthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom you must flee as you would wild beasts. For they are ravening dogs, who bite secretly, against whom you must be on your guard, inasmuch as they are men who can scarcely be cured. There is one Physician who is possessed both of flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>; both <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">made</a> and not made; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> existing <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">in flesh</a>; true life in death; both of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; first passible and then impassible&mdash; even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ our Lord</a>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter8">Chapter 8. Renewed praise of the Ephesians</h2>

<p>Let not then any one deceive you, as indeed you are not deceived, inasmuch as you are wholly devoted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For since there is no strife raging among you which might distress you, you are certainly living in accordance with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. I am far inferior to you, and require to be sanctified by your <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, so renowned throughout the world. They that are carnal cannot do those things which are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>, nor they that are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> the things which are carnal; even as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot do the works of unbelief,  nor unbelief the works of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But even those things which you do according to the flesh are <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>; for you do all things in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter9">Chapter 9. You have given no heed to false teachers</h2>

<p>Nevertheless, I have heard of some who have passed on from this to you, having <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a>, whom you did not allow to sow among you, but stopped your ears, that you might not receive those things which were sown by them, as being stones <span class="stiki" id="note010542"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:5</a></span> of the temple of the Father, prepared for the building of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father, and drawn up on high by the instrument of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note010543"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse32">John&nbsp;12:32</a></span> making use of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> as a rope, while your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was the means by which you ascended, and your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the way which led up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You, therefore, as well as all your fellow-travellers, are God-bearers, temple-bearers, Christ-bearers, bearers of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, adorned in all respects with the commandments of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, in whom also I exult that I have been thought worthy, by means of this Epistle, to converse and rejoice with you, because with respect to your <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life  you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> nothing but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only.</p>

<h2 class="chapter10">Chapter 10. Exhortations to prayer, humility, etc</h2>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> without ceasing in behalf of other men. For there is in them <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">repentance</a> that they  may attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. See,  then, that they be instructed by your works, if in no other way. Be meek in response to their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> in opposition to their boasting: to their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> return  your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; in contrast to their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, be stedfast <span class="stiki" id="note010556"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse23">Colossians&nbsp;1:23</a></span> in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and for their cruelty, manifest your gentleness. While we take care not to imitate their conduct, let us be found their brethren in all true kindness; and let us seek to be followers of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> (who ever more <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> treated, more destitute, more condemned?), that so no plant of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> may be found in you, but you may remain in all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and sobriety in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, both with respect to the flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter11">Chapter 11. An exhortation to fear God, etc</h2>

<p>The last times have come upon us. Let us therefore be of a reverent spirit, and fear the long-suffering of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that it tend not to our condemnation. For let us either stand in awe of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> to come, or show regard for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which is at present displayed&mdash; one of two things. Only [in one way or another] let us be found in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> unto the true life. Apart from Him, let nothing attract  you, for whom I bear about these bonds, these spiritual jewels, by which may I arise through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, of which I entreat I may always be a partaker, that I may be found in the lot of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, who have always been of the same mind with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> through the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter12">Chapter 12. Praise of the Ephesians</h2>

<p>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both who I am, and to whom I write. I am a condemned man, you have been the objects of  mercy; I am subject to danger, you are established in safety. You are the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> through  whom those pass that are cut off for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You are initiated into the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>, the deservedly most <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, at whose feet  may I be found, when I shall attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; who in all his <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> makes mention of you in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter13">Chapter 13. Meet together frequently for the worship of God</h2>

<p>Take heed, then, often to <a href="../cathen/14383a.htm">come together</a> to <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">give thanks</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and show forth His praise. For when you <a href="../cathen/14383a.htm">assemble</a> frequently in the same place, the powers of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> are destroyed, and the destruction at which he aims  is prevented by the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity</a> of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Nothing is more precious than peace, by which all <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, both in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth,  is brought to an end.</p>

<h2 class="chapter14">Chapter 14. Exhortations to faith and love</h2>

<p>None of these things is hid from you, if you perfectly possess that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> <span class="stiki" id="note010580"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:14</a></span> which are the beginning and the end of life. For the beginning is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the end is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note010581"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:5</a></span> Now these two, being inseparably connected together,  are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while all other things which are requisite for a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life follow after them. No man [<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>] making a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note010583"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:7</a></span> nor does he that possesses <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> any one. The tree is made manifest by its fruit; <span class="stiki" id="note010584"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;12:33</a></span> so those that profess themselves to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> shall be recognised by their conduct. For there is not now a demand for mere profession,  but that a man be found continuing in the power of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the end.</p>

<h2 class="chapter15">Chapter 15. Exhortation to confess Christ by silence as well as speech</h2>

<p>It is better for a man to be <a href="../cathen/13790a.htm">silent</a> and be [a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>], than to talk and not to be one. It is good to teach, if he who speaks also acts. There is then one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Teacher</a>, who spoke and it was done; while even those things which He did in <a href="../cathen/13790a.htm">silence</a> are worthy of  the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>. He who possesses the word of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, is truly able to hear even His very <a href="../cathen/13790a.htm">silence</a>, that he may be <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a>, and may both act as he speaks, and be recognised by his <a href="../cathen/13790a.htm">silence</a>. There is nothing which is hid from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but our very secrets are near to Him. Let us therefore do all things as those who have Him dwelling in us, that we may be His temples, <span class="stiki" id="note010590"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:19</a></span> and He may be in us as our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which indeed He is, and will manifest Himself before our faces. Wherefore we <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him.</p>

<h2 class="chapter16">Chapter 16. The fate of false teachers</h2>

<p>Do not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, my brethren. <span class="stiki" id="note010596"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse16">James&nbsp;1:16</a></span> Those that corrupt <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note010597"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:9-10</a></span> If, then, those who do this as respects the flesh have suffered death, how much more shall this be the case with any one who corrupts by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">wicked doctrine</a> the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was crucified! Such an one becoming defiled [in this way], shall go away into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, and so shall every one that hearkens unto him.</p>

<h2 class="chapter17">Chapter 17. Beware of false doctrines</h2>

<p>For this end did the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> allow the <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">ointment</a> to be poured upon His head, <span class="stiki" id="note010602"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse7">John&nbsp;12:7</a></span> that He might breathe <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> into His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Be not anointed with the bad odour of the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">prince of this world</a>; let him not lead you away captive from the life which is set before you. And why are we not all <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, since we have received the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>? Why do we foolishly perish, not recognising the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> which the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> has of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> sent to us?</p>

<h2 class="chapter18">Chapter 18. The glory of the cross</h2>

<p>Let my <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> be counted as nothing  for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, which is a stumbling-block <span class="stiki" id="note010607"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:18</a></span> to those that do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but to us <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and  life eternal. <q>Where is the wise man? Where the disputer?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010608"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:20</a></span> Where is the boasting of those who are styled <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>? For our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, was, according to the appointment  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, conceived in the womb by <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, but by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. He was born and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that by His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> He might purify the water.</p>

<h2 class="chapter19">Chapter 19. Three celebrated mysteries</h2>

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/15448a.htm">virginity</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> was hidden from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">prince of this world</a>, as was also her offspring, and the <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">death</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>; three <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of renown,  which were wrought in silence by  <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. How, then, was He manifested to the world?  A star shone forth in heaven above all the other stars, the light of which was inexpressible, while its novelty struck <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with astonishment. And all the rest of the stars, with the sun and moon, formed a chorus to this star, and its light was exceedingly great above them all. And there was agitation felt as to whence this new spectacle came, so unlike to everything else [in the heavens]. Hence every kind of magic was destroyed, and every bond of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> disappeared; <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> was removed, and the old kingdom abolished, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself being manifested in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form for the renewal of eternal life. And now that took a beginning which had been prepared by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Henceforth all things were in a state of tumult, because He meditated the abolition of death.</p>

<h2 class="chapter20">Chapter 20. Promise of another letter</h2>

<p>If <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> shall graciously permit me through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and if it be His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, I shall, in a second little work which I will write to you, make further manifest to you [the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of] the dispensation of which I have begun [to treat], with respect to the new man, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, in His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and in His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, in His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a> and in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. Especially [will I do this ] if the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> make known to me that you come together  man by man in common through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, individually,  in one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who was of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh, being both the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, so that you <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a> with an undivided <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, breaking one and the same <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">bread</a>, which is the medicine of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and the antidote to prevent us from dying, but [which causes] that we should live for ever in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter21">Chapter 21. Conclusion</h2>

<p>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be for yours and theirs  whom, for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have sent to <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>; whence also I write to you, giving thanks unto the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">loving</a> <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> even as I do you. Remember me, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> also remembered you. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, whence I am led bound to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, being the last of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who are there, even as I have been thought worthy to be chosen  to show forth the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Farewell in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father, and in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our common <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>.</p>
