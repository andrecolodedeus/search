<h1>The Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians</h1>

<h2>Greeting</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, who is also called Theophorus, to the [<a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>] <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ our Saviour</a>, in whom I salute the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is at <a href="../cathen/09533a.htm">Magnesia</a>, near the M&aelig;ander, and wish it abundance of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father, and in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1. Reason of writing the epistle</h2>

<p>Having been informed of your godly  <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, so well-ordered, I rejoiced greatly, and determined to commune with you in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. For as one who has been thought worthy of the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> of all names,  in those bonds which I bear about, I commend the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, in which I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for a union both of the flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the constant source of our life, and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, to which nothing is to be preferred, but especially of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and the Father, in whom, if we endure all the assaults of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">prince of this world</a>, and escape them, we shall enjoy God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. I rejoice in your messengers</h2>

<p>Since, then, I have had the privilege of seeing you, through Damas your most worthy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and through your worthy <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> Bassus and Apollonius, and through my fellow-servant the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Sotio, whose friendship may I ever enjoy, inasmuch as he is subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a> as to the law of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, [I now write  to you].</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Honour your youthful bishop</h2>

<p>Now it becomes you also not to treat your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> too familiarly on account of his youth,  but to yield him all reverence, having respect to  the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father, as I have known even <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> do, not judging rashly, from the manifest youthful appearance  [of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>], but as being themselves <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, submitting to him, or rather not to him, but to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of us all. It is therefore fitting that you should, after no <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocritical</a> fashion, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> [your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>], in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Him who has willed us [so to do], since he that does not so deceives not [by such conduct] the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> that is visible, but seeks to mock Him that is invisible. And all such conduct has reference not to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,  but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all secrets.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Some wickedly act independently of the bishop</h2>

<p>It is fitting, then, not only to be called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but to be so in reality: as some indeed give one the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but do all things without him. Now such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> seem to me to be not possessed of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, seeing they are not stedfastly gathered together according to the <a href="../cathen/04154a.htm">commandment</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Death is the fate of all such</h2>

<p>Seeing, then, all things have an end, these two things are simultaneously set before us&mdash; death and life; and every one shall go unto his own place. For as there are two kinds of coins, the one of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other of the world, and each of these has its special character stamped upon it, [so is it also here.]  The unbelieving are of this world; but the believing have, in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the character of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, by whom, if we are not in readiness to die into His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>,  His life is not in us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Preserve harmony</h2>

<p>Since therefore I have, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> before mentioned, beheld the whole multitude of you in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, I exhort you to study to do all things with a divine harmony,  while your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presides in the place of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and your <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> in the place of the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, along with your <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, who are most dear to me, and are entrusted with the ministry of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who was with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a> before the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>,  and in the end was revealed. Do all then, imitating the same divine conduct,  pay respect to one another, and let no one look upon his neighbour after the flesh, but continually <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> each other in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Let nothing exist among you that may divide you; but be <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">united</a> with your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07326a.htm">those that preside over you</a>, as a type and evidence of your <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Do nothing without the bishop and presbyters</h2>

<p>As therefore the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> did nothing without the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, being united to Him, neither by Himself nor by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, so neither do anything without the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>. Neither endeavour that anything appear reasonable and proper to yourselves apart; but being <a href="../cathen/14383a.htm">come together</a> into the same place, let there be one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, one supplication, one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, one <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> undefiled. There is one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, than whom nothing is more excellent. Therefore run together as into one <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as to one <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, as to one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who came forth from one Father, and is with and has gone to one.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Caution against false doctrines</h2>

<p>Be not deceived with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">strange doctrines</a>, nor with old fables, which are unprofitable. For if we still live according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish law</a>, we acknowledge that we have not received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For the divinest <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> lived according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>. On this account also they were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, being inspired by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to fully convince the unbelieving that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, who has manifested Himself by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who is His <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">eternal Word</a>, not proceeding forth from silence,  and who in all things pleased Him that sent Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Let us live with Christ</h2>

<p>If, therefore, those who were brought up in the ancient order of things  have come to the possession of a new  <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, no longer observing the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, but living in the observance  of the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Lord's Day</a>, on which also our life has sprung up again by Him and by His death&mdash; whom some deny, by which <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> we have obtained <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,  and therefore endure, that we may be found the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our only Master&mdash; how shall we be able to live apart from Him, whose <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> themselves in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> did wait for Him as their Teacher? And therefore He whom they rightly waited for, having come, <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">raised them from the dead</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note010684"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse52">Matthew&nbsp;27:52</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Beware of Judaizing</h2>

<p>Let us not, therefore, be insensible to His kindness. For were He to reward us according to our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, we should cease to be. Therefore, having become His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, let us learn to live according to the principles of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.  For whosoever is called by any other name besides this, is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Lay aside, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the old, the sour leaven, and be changed into the new leaven, which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Be salted in Him, lest any one among you should be corrupted, since by your savour you shall be convicted. It is absurd to profess  <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaize</a>. For <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> did not embrace  <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>, but <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, that so every tongue which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> might be gathered together to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. I write these things to warn you</h2>

<p>These things [I address to you], my beloved, not that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> any of you to be in such a state;  but, as less than any of you, I desire to guard you beforehand, that you fall not upon the hooks of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">vain doctrine</a>, but that  you attain to full assurance in regard to the birth, and <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> which took place in the time of the government of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, being truly and certainly accomplished by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who is our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note010707"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:1</a></span> from which may no one of you ever be turned aside.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. You are superior to me</h2>

<p>May I enjoy you in all respects, if indeed I be worthy! For though I am bound, I am not worthy to be compared to any of you that are at liberty. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">puffed up</a>, for you have <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> in yourselves. And all the more when I commend you, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you cherish modesty  of spirit; as it is written, <q>The righteous man is his own accuser.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010712"><a href="../bible/pro018.htm#verse17">Proverbs&nbsp;18:17</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Be established in faith and unity</h2>

<p>Study, therefore, to be established in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrines</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that so all things, whatsoever you do, may prosper both in the flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>; in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and in the Father, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; in the beginning and in the end; with your most admirable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the well-compacted spiritual crown of your <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> who are according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Be subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and to one another, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to the Father,  according to the flesh, and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to the Father, and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; that so there may be a union both fleshly and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Your prayers requested</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> as I do that you are full of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I have but briefly exhorted you. Be mindful of me in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, that I may attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, whence I am not worthy to derive my name: for I stand in need of your united <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> may be deemed worthy of being refreshed  by your <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Salutations</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesians</a> from <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a> (whence I also write to you), who are here for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as you also are, who have in all things refreshed me, salute you, along with <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrn&aelig;ans</a>. The rest of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, also salute you. Fare well in the harmony of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you who have obtained the inseparable <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>
