<h1>The Epistle of Ignatius to the Philadelphians</h1>

<h2>Greeting</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, who is also called Theophorus, to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, which is at <a href="../cathen/11793a.htm">Philadelphia</a>, in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>, which has obtained mercy, and is established in the harmony of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and rejoices unceasingly  in the passion of our Lord, and is filled with all mercy through his resurrection; which I salute in the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who is our <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and enduring <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, especially if [men] are in unity with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, who have been appointed according to the mind of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, whom He has established in security, after His own will, and by His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1. Praise of the bishop</h2>

<p>Which <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>,  I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, obtained the ministry which pertains to the common [good], not of himself, neither by men, <span class="stiki" id="note010885"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;1:1</a></span> nor through vainglory, but by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>; at whose meekness I am struck with admiration, and who by his silence is able to accomplish more than those who vainly talk. For he is in harmony with the commandments [of God], even as the harp is with its strings. Wherefore my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> declares his mind towards God a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> one, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it to be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and perfect, and that his stability as well as freedom from all <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is after the example of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>  meekness of the living God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Maintain union with the bishop</h2>

<p>Wherefore, as children of light and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, flee from division and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>  doctrines; but where the shepherd is, there follow as sheep. For there are many wolves that appear worthy of credit, who, by means of a pernicious pleasure, carry captive <span class="stiki" id="note010889"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:6</a></span> those that are running towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but in your unity they shall have no place.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Avoid schismatics</h2>

<p>Keep yourselves from those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> plants which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> does not tend, because they are not the planting of the Father. Not that I have found any division among you, but exceeding purity. For as many as are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> are also with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. And as many as shall, in the exercise of repentance, return into the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, these, too, shall belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that they may live according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Do not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, my brethren. If any man follows him that makes a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. If any one walks according to a strange  opinion, he agrees not with the passion [of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.].</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Have but one Eucharist, etc</h2>

<p>Take heed, then, to have but one <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>. For there is one flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and one cup to [show forth ] the unity of His blood; one altar; as there is one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, along with the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, my fellow-servants: that so, whatsoever you do, you may do it according to [the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of] God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Pray for me</h2>

<p>My brethren, I am greatly enlarged in loving you; and rejoicing exceedingly [over you], I seek to secure your safety. Yet it is not I, but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, for whose sake being bound I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the more, inasmuch as I am not yet perfect. But your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to God shall make me perfect, that I may attain to that portion which through mercy has been allotted me, while I flee to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> as to the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And let us also <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, because they too have proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>,  and placed their hope in Him,  and waited for Him; in whom also believing, they were saved, through union to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, being <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, worthy of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and admiration, having had <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> borne to them by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and being reckoned along with [us] in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the common hope.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Do not accept Judaism</h2>

<p>But if any one preach the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish law</a>  unto you, listen not to him. For it is better to hearken to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine from a man who has been <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, than to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a> from one uncircumcised. But if either of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> do not speak concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, they are in my judgment but as monuments and sepulchres of the dead, upon which are written only the names of men. Flee therefore the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> devices and snares of the prince  of this world, lest at any time being conquered  by his artifices,  grow weak in your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. But be all joined together  with an undivided heart. And I thank my God that I have a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> in respect to you, and that no one has it in his power to boast, either privately or publicly, that I have burdened  any one either in much or in little. And I wish for all among whom I have spoken, that they may not possess that for a testimony against them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. I have exhorted you to unity</h2>

<p>For though some would have deceived me according to the flesh, yet the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as being from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is not deceived. For it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> both whence it comes and whither it goes, <span class="stiki" id="note010939"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse8">John&nbsp;3:8</a></span> and detects the secrets [of the heart]. For, when I was among you, I cried, I spoke with a loud voice: Give heed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. Now, some suspected me of having spoken thus, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> beforehand the division caused by some among you.  But He is my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, for whose sake I am in bonds, that I got no intelligence from any man.  But the Spirit proclaimed  these words: Do nothing without the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; keep your bodies  as the temples of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;  <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> unity; avoid divisions; be the followers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, even as He is of His Father.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. The same continued</h2>

<p>I therefore did what belonged to me, as a man devoted to  unity. For where there is division and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, God does not dwell. To all them that repent, the Lord grants forgiveness, if they turn in penitence to the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to communion with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.  I trust [as to you] in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who shall free you from every bond. And I exhort you to do nothing out of strife, but according to the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. When I heard some saying, If I do not find it in the ancient  Scriptures, I will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; on my saying to them, It is written, they answered me, That remains to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. But to me <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is in the place of all that is ancient: His cross, and death, and resurrection, and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>  which is by Him, are undefiled monuments of antiquity; by which I desire, through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, to be justified.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. The Old Testament is good: the New Testament is better</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>  indeed are good, but the High Priest is better; to whom the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies has been committed, and who alone has been trusted with the secrets of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He is the door of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by which enter in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. All these have for their object the attaining to the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> possesses something transcendent [above the former dispensation], viz., the appearance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> and resurrection. For the beloved <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> announced Him,  but the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is the perfection of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.  All these things are good together, if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Congratulate the Antiochans on the close of the persecution</h2>

<p>Since, according to your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and the compassion which you feel in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, it is reported to me that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> possesses peace, it will become you, as a <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, to elect a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> to act as the ambassador of God [for you] to [the brethren there], that he may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> along with them when they are met together, and glorify the name [of God]. Blessed is he in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who shall be deemed worthy of such a ministry; and you too shall be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. And if you are willing, it is not beyond your power to do this, for the sake  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as also the nearest Churches have sent, in some cases <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and in others <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Thanks and salutation</h2>

<p>Now, as to Philo the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, of Cilicia, a man of <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, who still ministers to me in the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, along with Rheus Agathopus, an elect man, who has followed me from <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, not regarding  his life&mdash;these bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in your behalf; and I myself give thanks to God for you, that you have received them, even as the Lord you. But may those that dishonoured them be forgiven through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>! The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the brethren at <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a> salutes you; whence also I write to you by Burrhus, who was sent along with me by the Ephesians and Smyrn&aelig;ans, to show their respect.  May the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> them, in whom they hope, in flesh, and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and concord! Fare well in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, our common hope.</p>
