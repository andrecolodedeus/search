<h1>The Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans</h1>

<h2>Greeting</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, who is also called Theophorus, to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which has obtained mercy, through the majesty of the Most High Father, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, His only-begotten Son; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is beloved and enlightened by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him that wills all things which are according to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which also presides in the place of the region of the Romans, worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, worthy of the highest <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, worthy of praise, worthy of obtaining her every desire, worthy of being deemed <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,  and which presides over <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, is named from Christ, and from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, which I also salute in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Son of the Father: to those who are united, both according to the flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, to every one of His commandments; who are filled inseparably with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are purified from every strange taint, [I wish] abundance of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> unblameably, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our God.</p>

<h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1. As a prisoner, I hope to see you</h2>

<p>Through <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>  to God I have obtained the privilege of seeing your most worthy faces,  and have even  been granted more than I requested; for I hope as a prisoner in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> to salute you, if indeed it be the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that I be thought worthy of attaining unto the end. For the beginning has been well ordered,  if I may obtain <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to cling to  my lot without hindrance unto the end. For I am afraid of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,  lest it should do me an injury. For it is easy for you to accomplish what you please; but it is difficult for me to attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if you spare me.</p>

<h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2. Do not save me from martyrdom</h2>

<p>For it is not my desire to act towards you as a man-pleaser,  but as pleasing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even as also you please Him. For neither shall I ever have such [another] opportunity of attaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor will you, if you shall now be silent, ever be entitled to  the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of a better work. For if you are silent concerning me, I shall become God's; but if you show your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to my flesh, I shall again have to run my race. Pray, then, do not seek to confer any greater favour upon me than that I be <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to God while the altar is still prepared; that, being gathered together in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, you may sing praise to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, that God has deemed me, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, worthy to be sent for  from the east unto the west. It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to set from the world unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that I may rise again to Him.</p>

<h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3. Pray rather that I may attain to martyrdom</h2>

<p>You have never envied any one; you have taught others. Now I desire that those things may be confirmed [by your conduct], which in your instructions you enjoin [on others]. Only request in my behalf both inward and outward strength, that I may not only speak, but [<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>] will; and that I may not merely be called a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but really be found to be one. For if I be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> found [a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>], I may also be called one, and be then deemed faithful, when I shall no longer appear to the world. Nothing visible is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.  <q>For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</q>  For our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, now that He is with  the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is all the more revealed [in  His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>]. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is not a thing  of silence only, but also of [manifest] greatness.</p>

<h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4. Allow me to fall a prey to the wild beasts</h2>

<p>I write to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, and impress on them all, that I shall willingly die for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unless you hinder me. I beseech of you not to show an unseasonable good-will towards me. Allow me to become food for the wild beasts, through whose instrumentality it will be granted me to attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I am the wheat of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and let me be ground by the teeth of the wild beasts, that I may be found the pure bread of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Rather entice the wild beasts, that they may become my tomb, and may leave nothing of my body; so that when I have fallen asleep [in death], I may be no trouble to any one. Then shall I <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> be a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when the world shall not see so much as my body. Entreat Christ for me, that by these instruments  I may be found a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> [to God]. I do not, as Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, issue commandments unto you. They were <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; I am but a condemned man: they were free,  while I am, even until now, a servant. But when I suffer, I shall be the freed-man of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and shall rise again emancipated in Him. And now, being a prisoner, I learn not to desire anything worldly or vain.</p>

<h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5. I desire to die</h2>

<p>From <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> even unto Rome I fight with beasts,  both by land and sea, both by night and day, being bound to ten leopards, I mean a band of soldiers, who, even when they receive benefits,  show themselves all the worse. But I am the more instructed by their injuries [to act as a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Christ]; <q>yet am I not thereby justified.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010852"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:4</a></span> May I enjoy the wild beasts that are prepared for me; and I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> they may be found eager to rush upon me, which also I will entice to devour me speedily, and not deal with me as with some, whom, out of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, they have not touched. But if they be unwilling to assail me, I will compel them to do so. Pardon me  [in this]: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is for my benefit. Now I begin to be a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. And let no one, of things visible or invisible, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>  me that I should attain to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Let fire and the cross; let the crowds of wild beasts; let tearings,  breakings, and dislocations of bones; let cutting off of members; let shatterings of the whole body; and let all the dreadful  torments of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> come upon me: only let me attain to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<h2 id="chapter6">Chapter 6. By death I shall attain true life</h2>

<p>All the pleasures of the world, and all the kingdoms of this earth,  shall profit me nothing. It is better for me to die in behalf of  <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, than to reign over all the ends of the earth. <q>For what shall a man be profited, if he gain the whole world, but lose his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?</q>  Him I seek, who died for us: Him I desire, who rose again for our sake. This is the gain which is laid up for me. Pardon me, brethren: do not hinder me from living, do not wish to keep me in a state of death;  and while I desire to belong to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do not give me over to the world. Allow me to obtain pure light: when I have gone there, I shall indeed be a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Permit me to be an imitator of the passion of my God. If any one has Him within himself, let him consider what I desire, and let him have sympathy with me, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how I am straitened.</p>

<h2 id="chapter7">Chapter 7. Reason of desiring to die</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">prince of this world</a> would fain carry me away, and corrupt my disposition towards God. Let none of you, therefore, who are [in Rome] help him; rather be on my side, that is, on the side of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Do not speak of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and yet set your desires on the world. Let not <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> find a dwelling-place among you; nor even should I, when present with you, exhort you to it, be persuaded to listen to me, but rather give credit to those things which I now write to you. For though I am alive while I write to you, yet I am eager to die. My <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>  has been crucified, and there is no  fire in me desiring to be fed;  but there is within me a water that lives and speaks,  saying to me inwardly, Come to the Father. I have no delight in corruptible food, nor in the pleasures of this life. I desire the bread of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who became afterwards of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; and I desire the drink of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely His blood, which is incorruptible <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</p>

<h2 id="chapter8">Chapter 8. Be favourable to me</h2>

<p>I no longer wish to live after the manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and my desire shall be fulfilled if you consent. Be willing, then, that you also may have your desires fulfilled. I entreat you in this brief letter; give credit to me. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> will reveal these things to you, [so that you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>] that I speak <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>. He  is the mouth altogether free from <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, by which the Father has <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> spoken. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a> for me, that I may attain [the object of my desire]. I have not written to you according to the flesh, but according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If I shall suffer, you have wished [well] to me; but if I am rejected, you have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me.</p>

<h2 id="chapter9">Chapter 9. Pray for the church in Syria</h2>

<p>Remember in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, which now has God for its shepherd, instead of me. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> alone will oversee it, and your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> [will also regard it]. But as for me, I am ashamed to be counted one of them; for indeed I am not worthy, as being the very last of them, and one born out of due time. <span class="stiki" id="note010874"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:8-9</a></span> But I have obtained mercy to be somebody, if I shall attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. My spirit salutes you, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Churches that have received me in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and not as a mere passer-by. For even those Churches which were not  near to me in the way, I mean according to the flesh,  have gone before me,  city by city, [to meet me.]</p>

<h2 id="chapter10">Chapter 10. Conclusion</h2>

<p>Now I write these things to you from Smyrna by the Ephesians, who are deservedly most <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. There is also with me, along with many others, Crocus, one dearly beloved by me.  As to those who have gone before me from <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you are acquainted with them; to whom, [then,] make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that I am at hand. For they are all worthy, both of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of you; and it is becoming that you should refresh them in all things. I have written these things unto you, on the day before the ninth of the Kalends of September (that  is, on the twenty-third day of August). Fare well to the end, in the patience of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
