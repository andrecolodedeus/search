<h1>The Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans</h1>

<h2>Greeting</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, who is also called Theophorus, to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the beloved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, which has through mercy obtained every kind of gift, which is filled with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and is deficient in no gift, most worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and adorned with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>:  the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is at Smyrna, in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>, wishes abundance of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, through the immaculate Spirit and word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1. Thanks to God for your faith</h2>

<p><span class="sc">I Glorify</span> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who has given you such wisdom. For I have observed that you are perfected in an immoveable <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as if you were nailed to the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, both in the flesh and in the spirit, and are established in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> through the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, being fully persuaded with respect to our Lord, that He was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh, <span class="stiki" id="note010975"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;1:3</a></span> and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> according to the will and power  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that He was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John, in order that all righteousness might be fulfilled <span class="stiki" id="note010977"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;3:15</a></span> by Him; and was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> and <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> the tetrarch, nailed [to the cross] for us in His flesh. Of this fruit  we are by His divinely-blessed passion, that He might set up a standard <span class="stiki" id="note010979"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse26">Isaiah&nbsp;5:26</a>,&nbsp;<a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse22">Isaiah&nbsp;49:22</a></span> for all ages, through His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, to all His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and faithful [followers], whether among <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, in the one body of His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Christ's true passion</h2>

<p>Now, He suffered all these things for our sakes, that we might be saved. And He suffered <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, even as also He <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> raised up Himself, not, as certain unbelievers maintain, that He only seemed to suffer, as they themselves only seem to be [<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>]. And as they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, so shall it happen unto them, when they shall be divested of their bodies, and be mere <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirits. </p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Christ was possessed of a body after His resurrection</h2>

<p>For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> also He was still possessed of flesh,  and I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is so now. When, for instance, He came to those who were with <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, He said to them, <q>Lay hold, handle Me, and see that I am not an incorporeal spirit.</q>  And immediately they touched Him, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, being convinced both by His flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also they despised death, and were found its conquerors.  And after his resurrection He ate and drank with them, as being possessed of flesh, although spiritually He was united to the Father.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Beware of these heretics</h2>

<p>I give you these instructions, beloved, assured that you also hold the same opinions [as I do]. But I  guard you beforehand from those beasts in the shape of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whom you must not only not receive, but, if it be possible, not even meet with; only you must <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to God for them, if by any means they may be brought to repentance, which, however, will be very difficult. Yet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who is our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life, has the power of [effecting] this. But if these things were done by our Lord only in appearance, then am I also only in appearance bound. And why have I also surrendered myself to death, to fire, to the sword, to the wild beasts? But, [in fact,] he who is near to the sword is near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; he that is among the wild beasts is in company with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; provided only he be so in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. I undergo all these things that I may suffer together with Him, <span class="stiki" id="note011001"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;8:17</a></span> He who became a perfect man inwardly strengthening me. <span class="stiki" id="note011002"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Their dangerous errors</h2>

<p>Some <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a>  deny Him, or rather have been denied by Him, being the advocates of death rather than of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. These <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> neither have the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> persuaded, nor the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, nor the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> even to this day, nor the sufferings we have individually endured. For they think also the same thing regarding us.  For what does any one profit me, if he commends me, but blasphemes my Lord, not confessing that He was [<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>] possessed of a body?  But he who does not acknowledge this, has in fact altogether denied Him, being enveloped in death.  I have not, however, thought good to write the names of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, inasmuch as they are unbelievers. Yea, far be it from me to make any mention of them, until they repent and return to [a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> belief in] Christ's passion, which is our resurrection.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Unbelievers in the blood of Christ shall be condemned</h2>

<p>Let no man deceive himself. Both the things which are in heaven, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,  and rulers, both visible and invisible, if they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not in the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, shall, in  consequence, incur condemnation.  <q>He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note011010"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;19:12</a></span> Let not [high] place puff any one up: for that which is worth all is  <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, to which nothing is to be preferred. But consider those who are of a different opinion with respect to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ which has come unto us, how opposed they are to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They have no regard for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; no care for the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, or the orphan, or the oppressed; of the bond, or of the free; of the hungry, or of the thirsty.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Let us stand aloof from such heretics</h2>

<p>They abstain from the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> and from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>,  because they confess not the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> to be the flesh of our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, which suffered for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and which the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of His goodness, raised up again. Those, therefore, who speak against this gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, incur death  in the midst of their disputes. But it were better for them to treat it with respect,  that they also might rise again. It is fitting, therefore, that you should keep aloof from such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and not to speak of  them either in private or in public, but to give heed to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and above all, to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, in which the passion [of Christ] has been revealed to us, and the resurrection has been fully <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>.  But avoid all divisions, as the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Let nothing be done without the bishop</h2>

<p>See that you all follow the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, even as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> does the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a> as you would the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; and reverence the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, as being the institution  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Let no man do anything connected with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Let that be deemed a proper  <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, which is [administered] either  by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is, there is the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is not lawful without the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> either to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> or to celebrate a <a href="../cathen/01200b.htm">love-feast</a>; but whatsoever he shall approve of, that is also pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that everything that is done may be secure and valid. </p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Honour the bishop</h2>

<p>Moreover,  it is in accordance with reason that we should return to soberness [of conduct], and, while yet we have opportunity, exercise repentance towards God. It is well to reverence  both God and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He who honours the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has been honoured by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; he who does anything without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, does [in reality] serve the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Let all things, then, abound to you through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for you are worthy. You have refreshed me in all things, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> [shall refresh] you. You have loved me when absent as well as when present. May God recompense you, for whose sake, while you endure all things, you shall attain unto Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Acknowledgment of their kindness</h2>

<p>You have done well in receiving Philo and Rheus Agathopus as servants  of Christ our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who have followed me for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who give thanks to the Lord in your behalf, because you have in every way refreshed them. None of these things shall be lost to you. May my spirit be for you,  and my bonds, which you have not despised or been ashamed of; nor shall <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our perfect hope, be ashamed of you.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Request to them to send a messenger to Antioch</h2>

<p>Your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> has reached to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Coming from that place bound with chains, most acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  I salute all; I who am not worthy to be styled from thence, inasmuch as I am the least of them. Nevertheless, according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I have been thought worthy [of this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>], not that I have any sense  [of having deserved it], but by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which I wish may be perfectly given to me, that through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> I may attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In order, therefore, that your work may be complete both on earth and in heaven, it is fitting that, for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, your Church should elect some worthy delegate;  so that he, journeying into <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, may congratulate them that they are [now] at peace, and are restored to  their proper greatness, and that their proper constitution  has been re-established among them. It seems then to me a becoming thing, that you should send some one of your number with an epistle, so that, in company with them, he may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>  over the tranquility which, according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they have obtained, and because that, through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, they have now reached the harbour. As <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are perfect, you should also aim at  those things which are perfect. For when you are desirous to do well, God is also ready to assist you.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Salutations</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the brethren at <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a> salutes you; whence also I write to  you by Burrhus, whom you sent with me, together with the Ephesians, your brethren, and who has in all things refreshed me. And I would that all may imitate him, as being a pattern of a minister  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Grace will reward him in all things. I salute your most worthy  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and your very venerable  <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a>, and your <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, my fellow-servants, and all of you individually, as well as generally, in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and in His flesh and blood, in His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> and resurrection, both corporeal and spiritual, in union with God and you.  Grace, mercy, peace, and patience, be with you for evermore!</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Conclusion</h2>

<p>I salute the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of my brethren, with their wives and children, and the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who are called <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>.  Be strong, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, in the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Philo, who is with me, greets you. I salute the house of Tavias, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that it may be confirmed in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, both corporeal and spiritual. I salute Alce, my well-beloved,  and the incomparable Daphnus, and Eutecnus, and all by name. Fare well in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>
