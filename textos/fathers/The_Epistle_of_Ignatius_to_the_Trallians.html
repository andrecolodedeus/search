<h1>The Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallians</h1>

<h2>Greeting</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, who is also called Theophorus, to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is at <a href="../cathen/15016c.htm">Tralles</a>, in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a>, beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, elect, and worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, possessing peace through the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">flesh, and blood</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">passion</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who is our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, through our <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rising again</a> to Him,  which also I salute in its fullness,  and in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> character,  and wish abundance of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1. Acknowledgment of their excellence</h2>

<p><span class="sc">I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a></span> that you possess an unblameable and sincere mind in patience, and that not only in present practice,  but according to inherent nature, as Polybius your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has shown me, who has come to <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and so sympathized in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which I, who am bound in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, possess, that I beheld your whole multitude in him. Having therefore received through him the testimony of your good-will, according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I gloried to find you, as I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you were, the followers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Be subject to the bishop, etc</h2>

<p>For, since you are subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, you appear to me to live not after the manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who died for us, in order, by believing in His death, you may escape from death. It is therefore necessary that, as you indeed do, so without the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> you should do nothing, but should also  be subject to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a>, as to the apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who is our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, in whom, if we live, we shall [at last] be found. It is fitting also that the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, as being [the ministers] of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, should in every respect be pleasing to all.  For they are not ministers of meat and drink, but servants of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. They are bound, therefore, to avoid all grounds of accusation [against them], as they would do fire.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Honour the deacons, etc</h2>

<p>In like manner, let all reverence the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> as an appointment  of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who is the Son of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> as the sanhedrim of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and assembly of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Apart from these, there is no Church.  Concerning all this, I am persuaded that you are of the same opinion. For I have received the manifestation  of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and still have it with me, in your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whose very appearance is highly instructive,  and his meekness of itself a power; whom I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> even the ungodly must reverence, seeing they are  also pleased that I do not spare myself. But shall I, when permitted to write on this point, reach such a height of self-esteem, that though being a condemned  man, I should issue commands to you as if I were an apostle?</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. I have need of humility</h2>

<p>I have great <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  but I restrain myself, lest, I should perish through boasting. For now it is needful for me to be the more fearful; and not give heed to those that puff me up. For they that speak to me [in the way of commendation] scourge me. For I do indeed desire to suffer, but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not if I be worthy to do so. For this longing, though it is not manifest to many, all the more vehemently assails me.  I therefore have need of meekness, by which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">prince of this world</a> is brought to nought.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. I will not teach you profound doctrines</h2>

<p>Am I not able to write to you of heavenly things? But I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to do so, lest I should inflict injury on you who are but babes [in Christ]. Pardon me in this respect, lest, as not being able to receive [such doctrines], you should be strangled by them. For even I, though I am bound [for Christ], yet am not on that account able to understand heavenly things, and the places  of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and their gatherings under their respective princes, things visible and invisible. Without reference to such abstruse subjects, I am still but a learner [in other respects ]; for many things are wanting to us, that we come not short of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Abstain from the poison of heretics</h2>

<p>I therefore, yet not I, but the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, entreat you that you use <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> nourishment only, and abstain from herbage of a different kind; I mean <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. For those  [that are given to this] mix  up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> with their own poison, speaking things which are unworthy of credit, like those who administer a deadly drug in sweet wine, which he who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of does greedily  take, with a fatal pleasure  leading to his own death.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The same continued</h2>

<p>Be on your guard, therefore, against such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. And this will be the case with you if you are not puffed up, and continue in intimate union with  <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the enactments of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. He that is within the altar is pure, but  he that is without is not pure; that is, he who does anything apart from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>,  such a man is not pure in his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Be on your guard against the snares of the devil</h2>

<p>Not that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> there is anything of this kind among you; but I put you on your guard, inasmuch as I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you greatly, and foresee the snares of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Wherefore, clothing  yourselves with meekness, be renewed  in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that is the flesh of the Lord, and in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that is the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Let no one of you cherish any grudge against his neighbour. Give no occasion to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, lest by means of a few foolish men the whole multitude [of those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>] in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spoken of. For, <q>Woe to him by whose vanity my name is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> among any.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010777"><a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;52:5</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Reference to the history of Christ</h2>

<p>Stop your ears, therefore, when any one speaks to you at variance with   <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who was descended from David, and was also of Mary; who was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> born, and ate and drank. He was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>; He was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> crucified, and [<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>] died, in the sight of beings in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth. He was also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> raised from the dead, His Father quickening Him, even as after the same manner His Father will so raise up us who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, apart from whom we do not possess the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. The reality of Christ's passion</h2>

<p>But if, as some that are without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, the unbelieving, say, that He only seemed to suffer (they themselves only seeming to exist), then why am I in bonds? Why do I long to be exposed to  the wild beasts? Do I therefore die in vain?  Am I not then guilty of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>  against [the cross of] the Lord?</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Avoid the deadly errors of the Docet&aelig;</h2>

<p>Flee, therefore, those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> offshoots [of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>], which produce death-bearing fruit, whereof if any one tastes, he instantly dies. For these men are not the planting of the Father. For if they were, they would appear as branches of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and their fruit would be incorruptible. By it  He calls you through His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, as being His members. The head, therefore, cannot be born by itself, without its members; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is [the Saviour] Himself, having promised their union. </p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Continue in unity and love</h2>

<p>I salute you from Smyrna, together with the Churches of God which are with me, who have refreshed me in all things, both in the flesh and in the spirit. My bonds, which I carry about with me for the sake of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> that I may attain to God), exhort you. Continue in harmony among yourselves, and in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with one another; for it becomes every one of you, and especially the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, to refresh the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. I entreat you in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to hear me, that I may not, by having written, be a testimony against you. And also <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me, who have need of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, along with the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that I may be worthy of the lot for which I am destined, and that I may not be found reprobate.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Conclusion</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Smyrn&aelig;ans and Ephesians salutes you. Remember in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, from which also I am not worthy to receive my appellation, being the last  of them. Fare well in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, while you continue subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as to the command [of God], and in like manner to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a>. And, every man, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another with an undivided heart. Let my spirit be sanctified  by yours, not only now, but also when I shall attain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For I am as yet exposed to danger. But the Father is faithful in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to fulfil both mine and your petitions: in whom may you be found unblameable.</p>
