<h1>The Epistle of Mathetes to Diognetus</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. Occasion of the epistle</h2>

<p>Since I see you, most excellent Diognetus, exceedingly desirous to learn the mode of <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">worshipping</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> prevalent among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and inquiring very carefully and earnestly concerning them, what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> they trust in, and what form of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a> they observe,  so as all to look down upon the world itself, and despise death, while they neither esteem those to be gods that are reckoned such by the <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greeks</a>, nor hold to the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and what is the affection which they cherish among themselves; and finally, why this new kind or practice [of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>] has only now entered into the world,  and not long ago; I cordially welcome this your desire, and I implore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who enables us both to speak and to hear, to grant to me so to speak, that, above all, I may hear you have been edified,  and to you so to hear, that I who speak may have no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of regret for having done so.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. The vanity of idols</h2>

<p>Come, then, after you have freed  yourself from all prejudices possessing your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and laid aside what you have been accustomed to, as something apt to deceive  you, and being made, as if from the beginning, a new man, inasmuch as, according to your own confession, you are to be the hearer of a new [system of] doctrine; come and contemplate, not with your eyes only, but with your understanding, the substance and the form  of those whom you declare and deem to be gods.</p>

<p>Is not one of them a stone similar to that on which we tread? Is  not a second brass, in no way superior to those vessels which are constructed for our ordinary use? Is not a third wood, and that already rotten? Is not a fourth silver, which needs a man to watch it, lest it be stolen? Is not a fifth iron, consumed by rust? Is not a sixth earthenware, in no degree more valuable than that which is formed for the humblest purposes?</p>

<p>Are not all these of corruptible matter? Are they not fabricated by means of iron and fire? Did not the sculptor fashion one of them, the brazier a second, the silversmith a third, and the potter a fourth? Was not every one of them, before they were formed by the arts of these [workmen] into the shape of these [gods], each in its  own way subject to change? Would not those things which are now vessels, formed of the same materials, become like to such, if they met with the same artificers? Might not these, which are now worshipped by you, again be made by men vessels similar to others? Are they not all deaf? Are they not blind? Are they not without life? Are they not destitute of feeling? Are they not incapable of motion? Are they not all liable to rot? Are they not all corruptible?</p>

<p>These things you call gods; these you serve; these you worship; and you become altogether like them. For this reason you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, because they do not deem <em>these</em> to be gods. But do not you yourselves, who now think and suppose [such to be gods], much more cast contempt upon them than they [the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> do]? Do you not much more mock and insult them, when you worship those that are made of stone and earthenware, without appointing any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to guard them; but those made of silver and gold you shut up by night, and appoint watchers to look after them by day, lest they be stolen? And by those gifts which you mean to present to them, do you not, if they are possessed of sense, rather punish [than <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>] them? But if, on the other hand, they are destitute of sense, you convict them of this fact, while you worship them with blood and the smoke of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. Let any one of you suffer such indignities!  Let any one of you endure to have such things done to himself! But not a single <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being will, unless compelled to it,  endure such treatment, since he is endowed with sense and reason. A stone, however, readily bears it, seeing it is insensible. Certainly you do not show [by your  conduct] that he [your God] is possessed of sense. And as to the fact that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are not accustomed to serve such gods, I might easily find many other things to say; but if even what has been said does not seem to any one sufficient, I deem it idle to say anything further.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Superstitions of the Jews</h2>

<p>And next, I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that you are most desirous of hearing something on this point, that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> do not observe the same forms of divine worship as do the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, then, if they abstain from the kind of service above described, and deem it proper to worship one God as being Lord of all, [are right]; but if they offer Him worship in the way which we have described, they greatly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>. For while the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, by offering such things to those that are destitute of sense and hearing, furnish an example of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>; they, on the other hand by thinking to offer these things to God as if He needed them, might <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> reckon it rather an act of folly than of divine worship. For He that made heaven and earth, and all that is therein, and gives to us all the things of which we stand in need, certainly requires none of those things which He Himself bestows on such as think of furnishing them to Him. But those who <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that, by means of blood, and the smoke of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and burnt-offerings, they offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> [acceptable] to Him, and that by such honours they show Him respect, &mdash; these, by  supposing that they can give anything to Him who stands in need of nothing, appear to me in no respect to differ from those who studiously confer the same <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> on things destitute of sense, and which therefore are unable to enjoy such honours.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. The other observances of the Jews</h2>

<p>But as to their scrupulosity concerning meats, and their <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> as respects the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, and their boasting about <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and their fancies about <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and the new moons, which are utterly ridiculous and unworthy of notice&mdash;I do not  think that you require to learn anything from me. For, to accept some of those things which have been formed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the use of men as properly formed, and to reject others as useless and redundant&mdash;how can this be lawful? And to speak <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as if He forbade us to do what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> on the Sabbath-days&mdash;how is not this impious? And to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>  of the flesh as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of election, and as if, on account of it, they were specially beloved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;how is it not a subject of ridicule? And as to their observing months and days, <span class="stiki" id="note010277"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse10">Galatians&nbsp;4:10</a></span> as if waiting upon  the stars and the moon, and their distributing,  according to their own tendencies, the appointments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the vicissitudes of the seasons, some for festivities,  and others for mourning&mdash;who would deem this a part of divine worship, and not much rather a manifestation of folly? I suppose, then, you are sufficiently convinced that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> properly abstain from the vanity and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> common [to both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>], and from the busybody spirit and vain boasting of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; but you must not hope to learn the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of their peculiar mode of <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">worshipping</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from any mortal.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. The manners of the Christians</h2>

<p>For the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are distinguished from other men neither by country, nor language, nor the customs which they observe. For they neither inhabit cities of their own, nor employ a peculiar form of speech, nor lead a life which is marked out by any singularity. The course of conduct which they follow has not been devised by any speculation or deliberation of inquisitive men; nor do they, like some, proclaim themselves the advocates of any merely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> doctrines. But, inhabiting Greek as well as barbarian cities, according as the lot of each of them has determined, and following the customs of the natives in respect to clothing, food, and the rest of their ordinary conduct, they display to us their wonderful and confessedly striking  method of life. They dwell in their own countries, but simply as sojourners. As citizens, they share in all things with others, and yet endure all things as if foreigners. Every foreign land is to them as their native country, and every land of their birth as a land of strangers. They marry, as do all [others]; they beget children; but they do not destroy their offspring.  They  have a common table, but not a common bed.  They are in the flesh, but they do not live after the flesh. <span class="stiki" id="note010284"><a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:3</a></span> They pass their days on earth, but they are citizens of heaven. <span class="stiki" id="note010285"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse20">Philippians&nbsp;3:20</a></span> They <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the prescribed <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and at the same time surpass the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> by their lives. They <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by all. They are unknown and condemned; they are <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, and restored to life. <span class="stiki" id="note010286"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:9</a></span> They are poor, yet make many rich; <span class="stiki" id="note010287"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:10</a></span> they are in lack of all things, and yet abound in all; they are dishonoured, and yet in their very dishonour are <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. They are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spoken of, and yet are justified; they are reviled, and bless; <span class="stiki" id="note010288"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:12</a></span> they are insulted, and repay the insult with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; they do good, yet are punished as evil-doers. When punished, they <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> as if quickened into life; they are assailed by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as foreigners, and are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the Greeks; yet those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them are unable to assign any reason for their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. The relation of Christians to the world</h2>

<p>To sum up all in one word&mdash; what the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in the body, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are in the world. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is dispersed through all the members of the body, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are scattered through all the cities of the world. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> dwells in the body, yet is not of the body; and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> dwell in the world, yet are not of the world.  The invisible <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is guarded by the visible body, and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> indeed to be in the world, but their godliness remains invisible. The flesh <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against it, <span class="stiki" id="note010290"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:11</a></span> though itself suffering no injury, because it is prevented from enjoying pleasures; the world also <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, though in nowise injured, because they abjure pleasures. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> loves the flesh that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> it, and [loves also] the members; <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> likewise <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is imprisoned in the body, yet preserves  that very body; and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are confined in the world as in a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and yet they are the preservers  of the world. The <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> dwells in a mortal tabernacle; and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> dwell as sojourners in corruptible [bodies], looking for an incorruptible dwelling  in the heavens. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when but ill-provided with food and drink, becomes better; in like manner, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, though subjected day by day to punishment, increase the more in number.  God has assigned them this illustrious position, which it were unlawful for them to forsake.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. The manifestation of Christ</h2>

<p>For, as I said, this was no mere earthly invention which was delivered to them, nor is it a mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> system of opinion, which they judge it right to preserve so carefully, nor has a dispensation of mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> been committed to them, but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> God Himself, who is almighty, the Creator of all things, and invisible, has sent from heaven, and placed among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, [Him who is] the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and incomprehensible Word, and has firmly established Him in their hearts. He did not, as one might have imagined, send to men any servant, or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, or ruler, or any one of those who bear sway over earthly things, or one of those to whom the government of things in the heavens has been entrusted, but the very Creator and Fashioner of all things&mdash; by whom He made the heavens&mdash; by whom he enclosed the sea within its proper bounds&mdash; whose ordinances  all the stars  faithfully observe&mdash; from whom the sun  has received the measure of his daily course to be observed &mdash; whom the moon obeys, being commanded to shine in the night, and whom the stars also <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, following the moon in her course; by whom all things have been arranged, and placed within their proper limits, and to whom all are subject&mdash; the heavens and the things that are therein, the earth and the things that are therein, the sea and the things that are therein&mdash; fire, air, and the abyss&mdash; the things which are in the heights, the things which are in the depths, and the things which lie between. This [messenger] He sent to them. Was it then, as one  might conceive, for the purpose of exercising tyranny, or of inspiring <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and terror? By no means, but under the influence of clemency and meekness. As a king sends his son, who is also a king, so sent He Him; as God  He sent Him; as to men He sent Him; as a Saviour He sent Him, and as seeking to persuade, not to compel us; for <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> has no place in the character of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As calling us He sent Him, not as vengefully pursuing us; as loving us He sent Him, not as judging us. For He will yet send Him to judge us, and who shall endure His appearing?  ... Do you not see them exposed to wild beasts,  that they may be persuaded to deny the Lord, and yet not overcome? Do you not see that the more of them are punished, the greater becomes the number of the rest? This does not seem to be the work of man: this is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; these are the evidences of His manifestation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. The miserable state of men before the coming of the Word</h2>

<p>For, who of men at all understood before His coming what God is? Do you accept of the vain and silly doctrines of those who are deemed trustworthy <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>? Of whom some said that fire was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, calling that God to which they themselves were by and by to come; and some water; and others some other of the elements formed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if any one of these theories be worthy of approbation, every one of the rest of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things might also be declared to be God. But such declarations are simply the startling and erroneous utterances of deceivers;  and no man has either seen Him, or made Him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>,  but He has revealed Himself. And He has manifested Himself through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to which alone it is given to behold God. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Lord and Fashioner of all things, who made all things, and assigned them their several positions, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> Himself not merely a friend of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, but also long-suffering [in His dealings with them]. Yea, He was always of such a character, and still is, and will ever be, kind and good, and free from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and the only one who is [absolutely] good; <span class="stiki" id="note010304"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;19:17</a></span> and He formed in His mind a great and unspeakable conception, which He communicated to His Son alone. As long, then, as He held and preserved His own wise counsel in concealment,  He appeared to neglect us, and to have no care over us. But after He revealed and laid open, through His beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the things which had been prepared from the beginning, He conferred every blessing  all at once upon us, so that we should both share in His benefits, and see and be active  [in His service]. Who of us would ever have expected these things? He was aware, then, of all things in His own <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, along with His Son, according to the relation  subsisting between them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Why the Son was sent so late</h2>

<p>As long then as the former time  endured, He permitted us to be borne along by unruly impulses, being drawn away by the desire of pleasure and various <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>. This was not that He at all delighted in our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but that He simply endured them; nor that He approved the time of working iniquity which then was, but that He sought to form a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> conscious of righteousness,  so that being convinced in that time of our unworthiness of attaining life through our own works, it should now, through the kindness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be vouchsafed to us; and having made it manifest that in ourselves we were unable to enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, we might through the power of God be made able. But when our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> had reached its height, and it had been clearly shown that its reward,  punishment and death, was impending over us; and when the time had come which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had before appointed for manifesting His own kindness and power, how  the one <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through exceeding regard for men, did not regard us with <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, nor thrust us away, nor remember our iniquity against us, but showed great long-suffering, and bore with us,  He Himself took on Him the burden of our iniquities, He gave His own Son as a ransom for us, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> One for transgressors, the blameless One for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, the righteous One for the unrighteous, the incorruptible One for the corruptible, the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> One for those who are mortal. For what other thing was capable of covering our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> than His righteousness? By what other one was it possible that we, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and ungodly, could be justified, than by the only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? O sweet exchange! O unsearchable operation! O benefits surpassing all expectation! That the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of many should be hid in a single righteous One, and that the righteousness of One should justify many transgressors!  Having therefore convinced us in the former time  that our nature was unable to attain to life, and having now revealed the Saviour who is able to save even those things which it was [formerly] impossible to save, by both these facts He desired to lead us to trust in His kindness, to esteem Him our Nourisher, Father, Teacher, Counsellor, Healer, our Wisdom, Light, Honour, Glory, Power, and Life, so that we should not be anxious  concerning clothing and food.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. The blessings that will flow from faith</h2>

<p>If you also desire [to possess] this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, you likewise shall receive first of all the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father.  For God has loved <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, on whose account He made the world, to whom He rendered subject all the things that are in it,  to whom He gave reason and understanding, to whom alone He imparted the privilege of looking upwards to Himself, whom He formed after His own image, to whom He sent His only-begotten Son, to whom He has promised a kingdom in heaven, and will give it to those who have loved Him. And when you have attained this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, with what <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> do you think you will be filled? Or, how will you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him who has first so loved you? And if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, you will be an imitator of His kindness. And do not wonder that a man may become an imitator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He can, if he is willing. For it is not by ruling over his neighbours, or by seeking to hold the supremacy over those that are weaker, or by being rich, and showing <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> towards those that are inferior, that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is found; nor can any one by these things become an imitator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But these things do not at all constitute His majesty. On the contrary he who takes upon himself the burden of his neighbour; he who, in whatsoever respect he may be superior, is ready to benefit another who is deficient; he who, whatsoever things he has received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by distributing these to the needy, becomes a god to those who receive [his benefits]: he is an imitator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Then you shall see, while still on earth, that God in the heavens rules over [the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>]; then you shall begin to speak the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; then shall you both <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and admire those that suffer punishment because they will not deny <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; then shall you condemn the deceit and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the world when you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what it is to live <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> in heaven, when you shall despise that which is here esteemed to be death, when you shall <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> death, which is reserved for those who shall be condemned to the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, which shall afflict those even to the end that are committed to it. Then shall you admire those who for righteousness' sake endure the fire that is but for a moment, and shall count them <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> when you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> [the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of] that fire.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. These things are worthy to be known and believed</h2>

<p>I do not speak of things strange to me, nor do I aim at anything inconsistent with right reason;  but having been a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the Apostles, I have become a teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. I minister the things delivered to me to those that are <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> worthy of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For who that is rightly taught and begotten by the loving  Word, would not seek to learn accurately the things which have been clearly shown by the Word to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, to whom the Word being manifested has revealed them, speaking plainly [to them], not understood indeed by the unbelieving, but conversing with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who, being esteemed faithful by Him, acquired a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the Father? For which  reason He sent the Word, that He might be manifested to the world; and He, being despised by the people [of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>], was, when preached by the Apostles, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.  This is He who was from the beginning, who appeared as if new, and was found old, and yet who is ever born afresh in the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. This is He who, being from everlasting, is today called  the Son; through whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is enriched, and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, widely spread, increases in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, furnishing understanding, revealing <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, announcing times, rejoicing over the faithful, giving  to those that seek, by whom the limits of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are not broken through, nor the boundaries set by the fathers passed over. Then the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the law is chanted, and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a> is established, and the tradition of the Apostles is preserved, and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> exults; which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> if you grieve not, you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> those things which the Word teaches, by whom He wills, and when He pleases. For whatever things we are moved to utter by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Word commanding us, we communicate to you with pains, and from a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the things that have been revealed to us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. The importance of knowledge to true spiritual life</h2>

<p>When you have read and carefully listened to these things, you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what God bestows on such as rightly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, being made [as you are] a paradise of delight, presenting  in yourselves a tree bearing all kinds of produce and flourishing well, being adorned with various fruits. For in this place  the tree of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and the tree of life have been planted; but it is not the tree of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that destroys&mdash; it  is disobedience that proves destructive. Nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> are those words without significance which are written, how God from the beginning planted the tree of life in the midst of paradise, revealing through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the way to life,  and when those who were first formed did not use this [<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>] properly, they were, through the fraud of the Serpent, stripped naked.  For neither can life exist without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, nor is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> secure without life. Wherefore both were planted close together. The Apostle, perceiving the force [of this conjunction], and blaming that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which, without <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine, is admitted to influence life,  declares, <q>Knowledge puffs up, but <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> edifies.</q> For he who thinks he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> anything without <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and such as is witnessed to by life, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing, but is deceived by the Serpent, as not  loving life. But he who combines <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and seeks after life, plants in hope, looking for fruit. Let your heart be your wisdom; and let your life be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>  inwardly received. Bearing this tree and displaying its fruit, you shall always gather  in those things which are desired by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which the Serpent cannot reach, and to which deception does not approach; nor is Eve then corrupted,  but is trusted as a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is manifested, and the Apostles are filled with understanding, and the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>  of the Lord advances, and the choirs  are gathered together, and are arranged in proper order, and the Word rejoices in teaching the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>&mdash;by whom the Father is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>: to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </p>
