<h1>The Extant Writings of Asterius Urbanus</h1> 

<h2>1. The Exordium</h2>

<p>Having now for a very long and surely a very sufficient period had the charge pressed upon me by you, my dear Avircius  Marcellus, to write some sort of treatise against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> that bears the name of Miltiades,  I have somehow been very doubtfully disposed toward the task up till now; not that I felt any difficulty in refuting the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, and in bearing my testimony to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but that I was apprehensive and fearful lest I should appear to any to be adding some new word or precept  to the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, with respect to which indeed it is not possible for one who has chosen to have his manner of life in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> itself, either to add anything to it or to take away anything from it. Being recently, however, at Ancyra, a town of Galatia, and finding the church in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>  greatly agitated  by this new <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, as they call it, but which should rather be called this false <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, as shall be shown presently, I discoursed to the best of my ability, with the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for many days in the church, both on these subjects and on various others  which were brought under my notice by them. And this I did in such manner that the church rejoiced and was strengthened in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, while the adversaries  were immediately routed, and the opponents put to grief. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of the place accordingly requested us to leave behind us some memorandum of the things which we alleged in opposition to the adversaries of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, there being present also our fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Zoticus Otrenus.  This, however, we did not; but we promised, if the Lord gave us opportunity, to write down the matters here, and send them to them with all speed.</p>
<h2>2. From Book I</h2>

<p>Now the attitude of opposition  which they have assumed, and this new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of theirs which puts them in a position of separation from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, had their origin in the following manner. There is said to be a certain village called Ardaba  in the Mysia, which touches Phrygia.  There, they say, one of those who had been but recently <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a person of the name of <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>, when Gratus was proconsul of Asia, gave the adversary entrance against himself by the excessive <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after taking the lead. And this person was carried away in spirit;  and suddenly being seized with a kind of frenzy and <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, he raved, and began to speak and to utter strange things, and to prophesy in a manner contrary to the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as handed down from early times and preserved thenceforward in a continuous succession. And among those who were present on that occasion, and heard those spurious utterances, there were some who were indignant, and rebuked him as one frenzied, and under the power of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and possessed by the spirit of delusion, and agitating the multitude, and debarred him from speaking any more; for they were mindful of the Lord's distinction  and threatening, whereby He warned them to be on their guard vigilantly against the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>. But there were others too, who, as if elated by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and the prophetic gift, and not a little puffed up, and forgetting entirely the Lord's distinction, challenged the maddening and insidious and seductive spirit, being themselves cajoled and misled by him, so that there was no longer any checking him to silence.  And thus by a kind of artifice, or rather by such a process of craft, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> having devised destruction against those who were disobedient <span style="italic">to the Lord's warning</span>, and being unworthily honoured by them, secretly excited and inflamed their minds that had already left the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in order to play the harlot with <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.  For he stirred up two others also, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and filled them with the spurious spirit, so that they too spoke in a frenzy and unseasonably, and in a strange manner, like the person already mentioned, while the spirit called them <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> as they rejoiced and exulted proudly at his working, and puffed them up by the magnitude of his promises; while, on the other hand, at times also he condemned them skilfully and plausibly, in order that he might seem to them also to have the power of reproof.  And those few who were thus deluded were Phrygians. But the same arrogant spirit taught them to revile the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> universal under heaven, because that false spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> found neither <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> from it nor entrance into it. For when the faithful throughout Asia met together often and in many places of Asia for deliberation on this subject, and subjected those novel doctrines to examination, and declared them to be spurious, and rejected them as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, they were in consequence of that expelled from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and debarred from communion. </p>

<h2>3. From Book II</h2>

<p>Wherefore, since they stigmatized us as slayers of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>  because we did not receive their loquacious  <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash;for they say that these are they whom the Lord promised to send to the people&mdash;let them answer us in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and tell us, O friends, whether there is any one among those who began to speak from <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> onward that was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>? There is not one. Not even one of them is there who was seized and crucified for the name  <span style="italic">of Christ</span> . No; certainly not. Neither assuredly was there one of these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who was ever scourged in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, or <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>. No; never anywhere. It is indeed by another kind of death that <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> and Maximilla are said to have met their end. For the report is, that by the instigation of that maddening spirit both of them hung themselves; not together indeed, but at the particular time of the death of each  as the common story goes. And thus they died, and finished their life like the traitor Judas. Thus, also, the general report gives it that Theodotus&mdash; that astonishing person who was, so to speak, the first <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>  of their so-called <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and who, as if he were sometime taken up and received into the heavens, fell into spurious ecstasies,  and gave himself wholly over to the spirit of delusion&mdash; was at last tossed by him  into the air, and met his end miserably. People say then that this took place in the way we have stated. But as we did not see  them ourselves, we do not presume to think that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> any of these things with certainty. And it may therefore have been in this way perhaps, and perhaps in some other way, that <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> and Theodotus and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> mentioned above perished.</p>

<h2>4</h2>

<p>And let not the spirit of Maximilla say (as it is found in the same book of Asterius Urbanus ), <q>I am chased like a wolf from the sheep; I am no wolf. I am word, and spirit, and power.</q> But let him clearly exhibit and prove the power in the spirit. And by the spirit let him constrain to a confession those who were present at that time for the very purpose of trying and holding converse with the talkative spirit&mdash; those men so highly reputed as men and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>&mdash; namely, Zoticus of the village of Comana , and Julian of Apamea, whose mouths Themison  and his followers bridled, and prevented the false and seductive spirit from being confuted by them.</p>

<h2>5</h2>

<p>And has not the falsity of this also been made manifest already? For it is now upwards of thirteen years since the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> died, and there has arisen neither a partial nor a universal <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in the world. Nay, rather there has been steady and continued peace to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>6. From Book III</h2>

<p>But as they have been refuted in all their allegations, and are thus at a loss what to say, they try to take refuge in their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. For they say that they have many <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and that this is a sure <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the power of their so-called prophetic spirit. But this allegation, as it seems, carries not a whit more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with it than the others. For indeed some of the other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> have also a great multitude of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; but yet certainly we shall not on that account agree with them, neither shall we acknowledge that they have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in them. And those first <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> are called Marcionites, allege that they have a great multitude of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> for Christ. But yet they do not confess Christ Himself according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>7</h2>

<p>Hence, also, whenever those who have been called to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> happen to fall in with any of those so-called <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Phrygian heresy</a>, they always separate from them, and die without having fellowship with them, because they do not choose to give their assent to the spirit of <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. And that this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the case, and that it has actually taken place in our own times at Apamea, a town on the M&aelig;ander, in the case of those who suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> with Caius  and Alexander, natives of Eumenia, is clear to all.</p>

<h2>8</h2>

<p>As I found these things in a certain writing of theirs directed against the writing of our brother Alcibiades,  in which he proves the impropriety of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> speaking in <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, I made an abridgment of that work.</p>

<h2>9</h2>

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophet</a> falls into a spurious <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, which is accompanied by a want of all shame and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For beginning with a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> (designed) rudeness, he ends with an involuntary <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as has been already stated. But they will never be able to show that any one of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, or any one of the New, was carried away in spirit after this fashion. Nor will they be able to boast that <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a>, or Judas, or Silas, or the daughters of Philip, or <span style="italic">the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a></span> Ammia in <a href="../cathen/11793a.htm">Philadelphia</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12589b.htm">Quadratus</a>, or indeed any of the others who do not in any respect belong to them, were moved in this way.</p>

<h2>10</h2>

<p>For if, after <a href="../cathen/12589b.htm">Quadratus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> Ammia in <a href="../cathen/11793a.htm">Philadelphia</a>, as they say, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who attached themselves to <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> succeeded to the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, let them show us which of them thus succeeded <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> and his <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. For the apostle deems that the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> should abide in all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> up to the time of the final advent. But they will not be able to show the gift to be in their possession even at the present time, which is the fourteenth year only from the death of Maximilla. </p>
