<h1>The False Decretals</h1>

<h2>The First Epistle of Zephyrinus</h2> 

<p><strong>To All the Bishops of Sicily. Of the final decision of the trials of bishops, and graver ecclesiastical cases in the seat of the apostles.</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a></span>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> settled in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, greeting.</p>

<p>We ought to be mindful of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God to us, which in His own merciful regard has raised us for this purpose to the summit of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, that, abiding by His commandments, and appointed in a certain supervision of His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, we may prohibit things unlawful, and teach those that are to be followed. As night does not extinguish the stars of heaven, so the unrighteousness of the world does not blind the minds of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> that hold by the sure support of Scripture. Therefore we ought to consider well and attend carefully to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and the divine precepts which are contained in these Scriptures, in order that we may show ourselves not transgressors, but fulfillers of the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Now patriarchs and primates, in investigating the case of an accused <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, should not pronounce a final decision until, supported by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, they find that the person either confesses himself guilty, or is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> so by witnesses trustworthy and regularly examined, who should not be fewer in number than were those <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> whom the Lord directed to be chosen for the help of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>&mdash; that is, seventy-two. Detractors also, who are to be rooted out by divine authority, and the advisers of enemies (<em>auctores inimicorum</em>), we do not admit in the indictment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or in evidence against them; nor should any one of superior rank be indicted or condemned on the accusations of inferiors. Nor in a doubtful case should a decisive judgment be pronounced; nor should any trial be held valid unless it has been conducted according to order. No one, moreover, should be judged in his absence, because both divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> forbid that. The accusers of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should also be free of all suspicion, because the Lord has chosen that His pillars should stand firm, and not be shaken by any one who will. For a sentence should not bind any of them if it is not given by their proper judge, because even the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the world ordain that that be done. For any accused <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may, if it be necessary, choose twelve judges by whom his case may be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> judged. Nor should he be heard or <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> or judged until these be chosen by him; and on his being regularly summoned at first to a council of his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, his case should be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> heard by them, and investigated on sound principles. The end of his case, however, should be remitted to the seat of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that it may be finally decided there. Nor should it be finished, as has been decreed of old by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> or their successors, until it is sustained by its authority. To it also all, and especially the oppressed, should appeal and have recourse as to a mother, that they may be nourished by her breasts, defended by her authority, and relieved of their oppressions, because <q>a mother cannot,</q> and should not, <q>forget her son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082696"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;49:15</a></span> For the trials of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and graver <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> cases, as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> successors have decreed, are to be finally decided along with other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>  by the seat of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and by no other; because, although they may be transferred to other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, it was yet to the blessed Apostle Peter these terms were addressed: <q>Whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082698"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;16:19</a></span> And the other privileges which have been granted to this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> seat alone are found embodied both in the constitutions of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>  and their successors, and in very many others in harmony with these. For the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> have prefixed seventy  decrees, together with very many other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and have appointed them to be kept. For to judge rashly of the secrets of another's heart is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> to reprove him on suspicion whose works seem not other than good, since God alone is Judge of those things which are unknown to men. He, however, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the secrets of the heart,</q>  and not another. For <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judgments are to be guarded against by all, especially however by the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>And the servant of the Lord must not strive,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082702"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse24">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:24</a></span> nor harm any one. For <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are to be borne by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and masters by servants, in order that, under the exercise of endurance, things temporal may be maintained, and things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> hoped for. For that increases the worth of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which does not violate the purpose of religion. You should be earnestly intent that none of your brothers be grievously injured or undone. Therefore you ought to succour the oppressed, and deliver them from the hand of their persecutors, in order that with the blessed Job you may say: <q>The blessing of him that was ready to perish will come upon me, and I consoled the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> heart. I put on righteousness, and clothed myself with a robe and a diadem, my judgment. I was eye to the blind, and foot to the lame. I was a father to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not I searched out most carefully. I broke the grinders of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth;</q>  and so forth. You, therefore, who have been placed in eminence by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ought with all your power to check and repel those who prepare snares for brethren, or raise seditions and offenses against them. For it is easy by word to deceive man, not however God. Therefore you ought to keep these off, and be on your guard against them, until such darkness is done away utterly, and the morning star shines upon them, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> arises, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren. Given on the 20th September, in the consulship of the most illustrious Saturninus and Gallicanus. </p>

<h2>The Second Epistle of Zephyrinus</h2>

<p><strong>To the Bishops of the Province of Egypt.</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a></span>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to the most beloved brethren who serve the Lord in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</p>

<p>So great trust have we received from the Lord, the Founder of this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> seat and of the apostolic church, and from the blessed Peter, chief of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that we may labour with unwearied affection  for the universal Church which has been redeemed by the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and aid all who serve the Lord, and give help to all who live piously by apostolic authority. All who will live <span class="stiki" id="note082706"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse24">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:24</a></span> piously in Christ must needs endure reproaches from the impious and aliens, and be despised as fools and madmen, that they may be made better and purer who lose the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of time that they may gain those of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. But the contempt and ridicule of those who afflict and scorn them will be cast back upon themselves, when their abundance shall change to want, and their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to confusion.</p>

<h3>1. On the Spoliation or Expulsion of certain Bishops.</h3>

<p>It has been reported at the seat of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> by your delegates,  that certain of our brethren, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to wit, are being expelled from their churches and seats, and deprived of their goods, and summoned, thus destitute and spoiled, to trial; a thing which is void of all reason, since the constitutions of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and their successors, and the statutes of emperors, and the regulations of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, prohibit it, and the authority of the seat of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> forbids it to be done. It has been ordained, indeed, in the ancient statutes, that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have been ejected and spoiled of their property should recover their churches, and, in the first place, have all their property restored to them; and then, in the second place, that if any one may desire to accuse them <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, he should do so at the like risk; that the judges should be discreet, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> right-minded and harmonious in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, where they should be witnesses for every one who seemed to be oppressed; and that they should not answer till all that belonged to them was restored to them, and to their churches by law without detriment. Nor is it strange, brethren, if they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you, when they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> even to death your Head, Christ our Lord. Yet even <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> are to be endured patiently, that you may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, for whom also ye suffer. Whence, too, he says Himself, <q>Blessed are they which are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> for righteousness' sake.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082708"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;5:10</a></span> Sustained by these testimonies, we ought not greatly to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the reproach of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, nor be overcome by their up-braidings, since the Lord gives us this command by Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, <q>Hearken unto me, you that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> righteousness, my people, in whose heart is my law; <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> ye not the reproach of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, neither be ye afraid of their revilings;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082709"><a href="../bible/isa051.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;51:7</a></span> considering what is written in the Psalm, <q>Shall not God search this out? For He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the secrets of the heart,  and the thoughts of such men, that they are vanity,</q>  <q>They spoke vanity every one with his neighbour: with deceitful lips in their heart, and with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> heart they spoke. But the Lord shall cut off all deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaks <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> things; who have said, Our lips are our own; who is Lord over us?</q>  For if they kept these things in memory, they would by no means break forth into so great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. For they do not this by laudable and paternal instruction (<em>probabili et paterna doctrina</em>), but that they may wreak their vengeful feeling against the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is written, <q>The way of a fool is right in his eyes;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082713"><a href="../bible/pro012.htm#verse15">Proverbs&nbsp;12:15</a></span> and, <q>There are ways which seem right unto a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but the end thereof leads to death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082714"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse12">Proverbs&nbsp;14:12</a></span> Now we who suffer these things ought to leave them to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who will render to every man according to his works; <span class="stiki" id="note082715"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;16:27</a></span> who also has thundered through His servants, saying, <q>Vengeance is mine, I will repay.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082716"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;12:19</a></span> Assist ye, therefore, one another in good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and by deed and with a hearty will; nor let any one remove his hand from the help of a brother, since <q>by this,</q> says the Lord, <q>shall all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, if you have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one to another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082717"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;13:35</a></span> Whence, too, He speaks by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, <q>Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!</q>  In a spiritual dwelling, I interpret it, and in a concord which is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which distinguishes this pleasant dwelling according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which indeed was more beauteously illustrated in <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>  clothed with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, as ointment upon the head, nurturing the highest understanding and leading even to the end of wisdom. For in this dwelling the Lord has promised blessing and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Apprehending, therefore, the importance of this utterance of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, we have spoken this present brotherly word for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love's</a> sake, and by no means seeking, or meaning to seek, our own things. For it is not good to repay detraction with detraction, or <em>according to the common proverb</em> to cast out a beam with a beam (<em>excutere palum palo</em>). Be it far from us. Such manners are not ours. May the Godhead indeed forbid it. By the just judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, power is given sometimes to sinners to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in order that they who are aided and borne on by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> may become more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> through the discipline of sufferings. But to those very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a>, and reproach, and injure them, there will doubtless be woe. Woe, woe to those who injure the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for injury done to them concerns Him whose service they discharge, and whose function they execute. But we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that a door of enclosure be placed upon their mouths, as we desire that no one perish or be defiled by their lips, and that they think or publish with their mouth no hurtful word. Whence also the Lord speaks by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>I said I will take heed to my ways, that I <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not with my tongue.</q>  May the Lord Almighty, and His only-begotten Son and our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, give you this incitement, that with all means in your power you aid all the brethren under whatsoever tribulations they labour, and esteem, as is meet, their sufferings your own. Afford them the utmost assistance by word and deed, that you may be found His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who enjoined all to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the brethren as themselves.</p>

<h3>2. On the Ordination of Presbyters and Deacons.</h3>

<p>Ordinations of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, moreover, solemnly perform on a suitable occasion, and in the presence of many witnesses; and to this duty advance tried and learned men, that you may be greatly gladdened by their fellowship and help. Place the confidence of your hearts without ceasing on the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and declare these and the other divine words to succeeding generations: <q>For this is our God for ever and ever, and He will guide us to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.</q>  Given on the 7th November, in the consulship of the most illustrious Saturninus and Gallicanus. </p>

<h2>The First Epistle of Pope Callistus</h2> 

<p><strong>To Bishop Benedictus. On the Fasts of the Four Seasons, and that no one should take up an accusation against a doctor (teacher).</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Callistus</span>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to Benedictus, our brother and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>By the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the brotherhood we are bound, and by our apostolic rule we are constrained, to give answer to the inquiries of the brethren, according to what the Lord has given us, and to furnish them with the authority of the seal of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</p>

<h3>1. Of the seasons for fasting.</h3>

<p>Fasting, which you have learned to hold three times in the year among us, we decree now to take place, as more suitable, in four seasons; so that even as the year revolves through four seasons, we too may keep a solemn fast quarterly in the four seasons of the year. And as we are replenished with grain, and wine, and oil for the nourishment of our bodies, so let us be replenished with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> for the nourishment of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, in accordance with the word of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Zechariah, who says, <q>The word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thus says the Lord of hosts, As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and I repented not; so again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem, and to the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Judah</a>: <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> ye not. These are the things that you shall do: Speak ye every man the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to his neighbour; judge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the judgment of peace in your gates; and let none of you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in your hearts against his neighbour, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> no false <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>: for all these are things that I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, says the Lord of hosts. And the word of the Lord of hosts came unto me, saying, Thus says the Lord of hosts, The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of the Lord <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, and cheerful feasts; only <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and peace, says the Lord of hosts.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082725"><a href="../bible/zec008.htm#verse1">Zechariah&nbsp;8:1-19</a></span> In this, then, we ought to be all of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so that, according to apostolic teaching, we may all say the same thing, and that there be no divisions among us. Let us then be perfect in the same <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and in the same judgment; <span class="stiki" id="note082726"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;iii</a></span> in ready <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for which work we congratulate ourselves on having your affection as our partner. For it is not meet for the members to be at variance with the head; but, according to the testimony of sacred Scripture, <span class="stiki" id="note082727"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12</a></span> all the members should follow the head. It is matter of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, moreover, to no one, that the church of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> is the mother of all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, from whose ordinances it is not right that you should deviate to any extent. And as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> came to do the Father's will, so shall you fulfil the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of your mother, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the head of which, as has been stated already, is the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">church of Rome</a>. Wherefore, whatsoever may be done against the discipline of this church, without the decision of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, cannot on any account be permitted to be held valid.</p>

<h3>2. Of accusations against doctors.</h3>

<p>Moreover, let no one take up an accusation against a doctor (<em>teacher</em>), because it is not right for sons to find fault with fathers, nor for slaves to wound their masters. Now, all those whom they instruct are sons of doctors; and as sons ought to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their fathers after the flesh, so ought they to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their spiritual fathers. For he does not live rightly who does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> rightly, or who reprehends fathers, or <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniates</a> them. Doctors therefore, who are also called fathers, are rather to be borne with than reprehended, unless they <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Let no one, consequently, accuse a doctor by writing (<em>per scripta</em>); neither let him answer to any accuser, unless he be one who is trustworthy and recognised by law, and who leads also a life and conversation free from reproach. For it is a thing unworthy that a doctor should reply to a foolish and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> person, and one who leads a reprehensible life, according to the man's folly; as <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, Answer not a fool according to his folly. <span class="stiki" id="note082728"><a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse4">Proverbs&nbsp;26:4</a></span> He does not live rightly who does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> rightly. He means nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> who is faithful. If anyone is faithful (<em>a believer</em>), let him see to it that he make no false allegations, nor lay a snare for any man. The faithful man acts always in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and the unfaithful man plots cunningly, and strives to work the ruin of those who are faithful, and who live in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and righteousness, because like seeks like. The unfaithful man is one dead in the living body. And on the other hand, the discourse of the man of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> guards the life of his hearers. For as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> doctor, and especially the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Lord, ought to be involved in no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, so ought he to be wronged by no machination or passion. <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> indeed says, Go not after your <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, but refrain yourself from your appetites; <span class="stiki" id="note082729"><a href="../bible/sir018.htm#verse30">Sirach&nbsp;18:30</a></span> and we must resist many allurements of this world, and many vanities, in order that the integrity of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> continence may be obtained, whereof the first blemish is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, the beginning of transgression and the origin of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for the mind with lustful will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> neither to abstain nor to give itself to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. No <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man has an enemy except in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, who are permitted to be such only in order that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man may be corrected or exercised through their means. Whatever, therefore, is faultless is defended by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Neither for prince, nor for any one who observes <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, is it lawful to venture anything contrary to the divine injunctions. Consequently an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judgment, or an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> decision (<em>diffinitio</em>), instituted or enforced by judges under the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or by the command of a prince, or any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or person of influence, cannot be valid. The religious man ought not to hold it enough merely to refrain from entering into the enmities of others, or increasing them by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speech, unless he also make it his study to extinguish them by good speech.  Better is a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> confession in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>, than a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> boasting in good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.  Moreover, all who live the blessed life, choose rather to run that course in the proper estate of peace and righteousness, than to involve themselves in the avenging pains of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.  For I am mindful that I preside over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under the name of him whose confession was honoured by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ever destroys all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. And I understand that I am not at liberty to act otherwise than to expend all my efforts on that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in which the well-being of the universal Church is at stake (<em>infestatur</em>). I hope, too, that the mercy of God will so favour us, that, with the help of His clemency, every deadly disease may be removed, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself expelling it, and that whatever may be done wholesomely, under His inspiration and help, may be accomplished to the praise of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and devotion. For all things cannot otherwise be safe, unless, as far as pertains to the service of the divine office, sacerdotal authority upholds them. Given on the 21st day of November in the consulship of the most illustrious Antoninus and Alexander. </p>

<h2>The Second Epistle of Pope Callistus</h2>

<p><strong>To All the Bishops of Gaul. Of conspiracies and other illicit pursuits, that they be not engaged in, and of the restoration of the lapsed after penitence.)</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Callistus</span> to our most dearly beloved brethren, all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> settled throughout <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>.</p>

<p>By the report of very many, we learn that your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, holds and guides the helm of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> so firmly in the face of all assaults, that by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> it is conscious neither of shipwreck nor of the losses of shipwreck. Rejoicing, therefore, in such testimonies, we beg you not to permit anything to be done in those parts contrary to the apostolic statutes; but, supported by our authority, check what is injurious, and prohibit what is unlawful.</p>

<h3>1. Of those who conspire against bishops, or who take part with such.)</h3>

<p>Now we have heard that the crime of conspiracies prevails in your parts, and it has been shown us that the people are conspiring against their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; of which crime the craft is hateful, not only among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but even among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and it is forbidden by foreign <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. And therefore the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> not only of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but of the world, condemn those who are guilty of this crime; and not only those indeed who actually conspire, but those also who take part with such. <span class="stiki" id="note082734"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;1:32</a></span> Our predecessors, moreover, together with a very numerous body of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, ordained that any <em>guilty of this offense</em> among those who are set in the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and who belong to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, should be deprived of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which they enjoy; and they ordered that others should be cut off from communion, and expelled from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and they decreed, at the same time, that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of both orders should be <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> (<em>infames</em>); and that, too, not only for those who did the deed, but for those also who took part with such. For it is but equitable that those who despise the divine mandates, and prove themselves disobedient to the ordinances of the fathers, should be chastised with severer penalties, in order that others may <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to do such things, and that all may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in brotherly concord, and all take to themselves the example of severity and goodness. For if (which may God forbid) we neglect the care of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and are regardless of its strength, our slothfulness will destroy discipline, and injury will be done assuredly to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, moreover, are not to be admitted to accuse any one: neither can their voice, nor that of those who are under the ban, injure or criminate any man.</p>

<h3>2. Of those who have intercourse with excommunicated persons, or with unbelievers.)</h3>

<p>Those, too, who are <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, let no one receive previous to the just examination of both sides; nor let him have any intercourse with such in speech, or in eating or drinking, or in the salutation with the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, nor let him greet such; because, whosoever wittingly holds intercourse with the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> in these or other prohibited matters, will subject himself, according to the ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,  to like excommunication. From these, therefore, let <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> keep themselves if they would not have the same penalty to endure. Also do not join the unbelievers, neither have any fellowship with them. They who do such things, indeed, are judged not as <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, but as unbelievers. Whence the apostle says: <q>What part has he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> with an <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a>? Or what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082736"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:14-15</a></span> </p>

<h3>3. That no bishop should presume in anything pertaining to another's parish, and of the transference of bishops.)</h3>

<p>Let no one, again, trespass upon the boundaries of another, nor presume to judge or excommunicate one belonging to another's parish; because such judgment or ordination, or excommunication or condemnation, shall neither be ratified nor have any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; since no one shall be bound by the decision of another judge than his own, neither shall he be condemned by such. Whence also the Lord speaks to this effect: <q>Pass not the ancient landmarks which your fathers have set.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082737"><a href="../bible/pro022.htm#verse28">Proverbs&nbsp;22:28</a></span> Moreover, let no primate or metropolitan <em>invade</em> the church or parish of a diocesan (<em>di&oelig;cesani</em>), or presume to excommunicate or judge any one belonging to his parish, or do anything without his counsel or judgment; but let him observe this law, which has been laid down by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>  and fathers, and our predecessors, and has been ratified by us: to wit, that if any metropolitan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, except in that which pertains to his own proper parish alone, shall attempt to do anything without the counsel and good-will of all the comprovincial <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, he will do it at the risk of his position, and what he does in this manner shall be held null and void; but whatever it may be necessary to do or to arrange with regard to the cases of the body of provincial <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and the necessities of their churches and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, this should be done by consent of all the pontiffs of the same province, and that too without any <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of lordship, but with the most <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and harmonious action, even as the Lord says: <q>I came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082739"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;20:28</a></span> And in another passage He says: <q>And whosoever of you is the greater, shall be your servant,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082740"><a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse44">Mark&nbsp;10:44</a></span> and so forth. And in like manner the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the same province themselves should do all things in counsel with him, except so much as pertains to their own proper parishes, in accordance with the statutes of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers (who, although they have preceded us by a certain interval of time, have yet drawn the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from one and the same fountain of purity, and have sought the prosperity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> and the common advantage of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by the same enlightening and guiding Spirit), that with one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and one mouth, and one accord, the Holy Trinity may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> for ever. No primate, no metropolitan, nor any of the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, is at liberty to enter the seat of another, or to occupy a possession which does not pertain to him, and which forms part of the parish of another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, at the direction of any one, unless he is invited by him to whose jurisdiction it is acknowledged to belong; nor can he set about any arrangement or ordinance, or judgment there, if he wishes to keep the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of his station. But if he presume to do otherwise, he shall be condemned; and not only he, but those who co-operate and agree with him: for just as the power of making appointments (<em>ordinatio</em>) is interdicted in such circumstances, so also is the power of judging or of disposing of other matters. For if a man has no power to appoint, how shall he judge? Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, he shall in no wise judge or have power to judge: for just as another man's wife cannot intermarry with anyone (<em>adulterari</em>), nor be judged or disposed of by any one but by her own husband so long as he lives; so neither can it in anywise be allowed that the wife of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, by whom undoubtedly is meant his church or parish, should be judged or disposed of by another without his (the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a>) judgment and good-will so long as he lives, or enjoy another's embrace, that is, his ordaining. Wherefore the apostle says: <q>The wife is bound by the law so long as her husband lives; but if he be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082741"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;7:2</a></span> In like manner also, the spouse of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (for the church is called his spouse and wife) is bound to him while he lives; but when he is dead she is loosed, and may be wedded to whomsoever she will, only in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, that is, according to order. For if, while he is alive, she marry another, she shall be judged to be an adulteress. And in the same manner, he too, if he marry another of his own will, shall be held to be an adulterer, and shall be deprived of the privilege of communion. If, however, he is <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> in his own church, he must flee to another, and attach himself to it, as the Lord says: <q>If they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you in one city, flee ye into another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082742"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;10:23</a></span> If, however, the change be made for the sake of the good <em>of the church</em>, he may not do this of himself, but only on the invitation of the brethren, and with the sanction of this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> seat, and not for ambition's sake, but for the public good.</p>

<h3>4. Of marriages among blood-relations, and of those who are born of them; and of accusations which the laws reject.)</h3>

<p>Moreover, marriages among blood-relations are forbidden, since all <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, both sacred and secular, forbid such. Wherefore the divine <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> not only expel, but even <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a>, those who do so, and those who spring from them. Secular <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, again, call such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a>, and interdict them from inheriting. And we too, following our fathers, and keeping close by their footsteps, brand such with <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>, and hold them to be <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a>, because they are sprinkled with the stains of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>. Neither ought we to admit those men or their accusations, that secular <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> reject. (For who doubts that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, when they are not inconsistent with reason and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, are to be embraced, especially when they either further the public good or defend the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office, and uphold it as a help?) And we call those blood-relations whom divine <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and those of the emperors, both Roman and Greek, name blood-relations, and whom they admit to the right of inheriting, and cannot exclude from that. Marriages, then, between such are neither lawful nor capable of holding good, but are to be rejected. (And if any such are attempted in rash daring, they come to be rescinded by apostolic authority.)</p>

<h3>5. Of those who ought not to be admitted to prefer an accusation, or to bear witness; and that evidence is not to be given but on things happening in the person's presence.</h3>

<p>Whosoever, therefore, has not been lawfully married, or has been united without the dotal title (<em>dotali titulo</em>) and the blessing of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, cannot by any means bring a charge against <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, or those who are lawfully married, or bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against them, since every one who is polluted with the stain of incest is <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a>, and is not allowed to accuse the above-named. And consequently not only they, but all those too who agree with them, are to be rejected, and are rendered <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a>. We hold that the same should also be the case with <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, or with those who assault the elderly. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the world, indeed, put such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to death; but we, with whom mercy has the first place, receive them under the mark of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> to repentance. That <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> also with which they are stained, we are not able to remove; but our desire is to heal their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by public penitence, and by satisfaction made to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: for public <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not to be purged by secret correction. Those, again, who are suspected in the matter of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, should by no means be admitted to prefer charges against <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and against those of whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>; and such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should be held of doubtful authority in matters of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> testimony. Their voice, consequently, should be reckoned invalid whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>; and no credit should be given to those who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>. Accordingly, in judgment,  inquiry should be made as to the conversation and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the person who accuses, and of him who is accused; since those who are not of correct conversation and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and whose life is open to impeachment, are not allowed to accuse their elders, neither can such permission be given to those whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and life and liberty are unknown. Nor should vile <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> be admitted to accuse them. But a clear examination is to be made as to what kind of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> the accusers are (<em>rimand&aelig; sunt enucleatim person&aelig; accusatorum</em>); for they are not to be admitted readily without writing, and are never to be admitted <em>as accusers</em> on mere writing. For no one may either accuse or be accused by mere writing, but with the living voice; and every one must lay his accusation in the presence of him whom he seeks to accuse. And no credit should be given to any accuser in the absence of him whom he seeks to accuse. In like manner, witnesses must not prefer their evidence by writing only; but they must give their testimony <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfully</a> in their own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and in matters which they have seen and do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. And they are not to give evidence in any other cases or matters but in those which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have happened in their presence. Accusers, moreover, of one blood, are not to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against those who are not related to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, nor is that to be the case with domestics (<em>familiares</em>) or those proceeding from the house; but if it is their wish, and they agree among themselves, the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> only should give evidence in such cases, and not others. Neither accusers nor witnesses should be admitted who are open to any suspicion; for the feeling of relationship, or friendship, or lordship, is wont to impede the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Carnal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, commonly blunt the perceptions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and pervert their opinions; so that they look on gain as godliness, and on money as the reward of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Let no one, then, speak deceitfully to his neighbour.  The mouth of the malevolent is a deep pit. The innocent man, while he believes easily, falls readily; but though he falls, he rises; and the shuffler, with all his arts, goes headlong to ruin, whence he can never rise or escape. Therefore let every one weigh well his words, and let him not say to another what he would not say to himself. Whence the sacred <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says well: <q>Do not that to another which you would not have done to yourself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082744"><a href="../bible/tob004.htm#verse15">Tobit&nbsp;4:15</a></span> For we need time to do anything perfectly (<em>maturius</em>); and let us not be precipitate in our counsels or our works, neither let us violate order. But if any one has fallen in anything, let us not consign him to ruin; but let us reprove him with brotherly affection, as the blessed apostle says: <q>If a man be overtaken in any fault, you which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted. Bear ye one another's burden, and so will you fulfil the law of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q>  Furthermore, the sainted David had deadly crimes to repent of, and yet he was continued in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. The blessed Peter also shed the bitterest tears when he repented of having denied the Lord; but still he abode an apostle. And the Lord by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> makes this promise to the sinning: <q>In the day that the sinner is converted, and <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">repents</a>, I will not mention any more against him all his transgressions.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082746"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse21">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:21-22</a></span> </p>

<h3>6. As to whether a priest may minister after a lapse.</h3>

<p>For those are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> who think that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Lord, after a lapse, although they may have exhibited <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> repentance, are not capable of ministering to the Lord, and engaging their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> offices, though they may lead a good life thereafter, and keep their <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> correctly. And those who hold this opinion are not only in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but also seem to dispute and act in opposition to <em>the power of</em> the keys committed to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whereof it is said: <q>Whatsoever you shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082747"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;18:18</a></span> And in short, this opinion either is not the Lord's, or it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But <em>be that as it may</em>, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> without hesitation, that both the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Lord and other <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> may return to their honours after a proper satisfaction for their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, as the Lord Himself testifies by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Shall he who falls not also rise again? And shall he who turns away not return?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082748"><a href="../bible/jer008.htm#verse4">Jeremiah&nbsp;8:4</a></span> And in another passage the Lord says: <q>I desire not the death of the sinner, but that he may turn, and live.</q>  And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> David, on his repentance, said: <q>Restore unto me the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and uphold me with Your free Spirit.</q>  And he indeed, after his repentance, taught others also, and offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, giving thereby an example to the teachers of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, that if they have fallen, and thereafter have exhibited a right repentance to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they may do both things in like manner. For he taught when he said: <q>I will teach transgressors Your ways, and sinners shall be converted unto You.</q>  And he offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for himself, while he said: <q>The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for God is a broken spirit.</q>  For the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, seeing his own transgressions purged by repentance, had no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to healing those of others by preaching, and by making offering to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus the shedding of tears moves the mind's feeling (<em>passionem</em>). And when the satisfaction is made good, the mind is turned aside from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. For how does that man think that mercy will be shown to himself, who does not forgive his neighbour? If offenses abound, then, let mercy also abound; for with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption.  In the Lord's hand there is abundance of all things, because He is the Lord of powers (<em>virtutum</em>) and the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.  For the apostle says: <q>All have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and come short of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; being justified freely by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, through the redemption that is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>: whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has set forth to be a propitiation through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that are past, through the forbearance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; to declare, 'I say,' at this time His righteousness, that He might be just, and the justifier of him which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Jesus.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082755"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;3:23-26</a></span> And David says: <q>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are covered.</q>  Man, therefore, is cleansed of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and rises again by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God though he has fallen, and abides in his first position, according to the above-cited authorities.

<h2>The Epistle of Pope Urban I</h2> 

<p><strong>To All Christians. Of the church's receiving only the property of the faithful, and not the price of the same, as in the times of the apostles; and as to why elevated seats should be prepared in the churches for the bishops; and as to the fact that no one should have intercourse with those whom the bishops excommunicate, and that no one should receive those whom they have cast out in any manner whatever. </strong></p>

<p>Urban, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, in sanctification of the spirit, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> and sprinkling of the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, greeting.</p>

<p>It becomes all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, most dearly beloved, to imitate Him whose name they have received. <q>What does it profit, my brethren,</q> says the Apostle James, <q>though a man say he has <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and have not works?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082764"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse14">James&nbsp;2:14</a></span> <q>My brethren, be not many masters, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that you receive (<em>sumitis</em>) the greater condemnation; for in many things we offend all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082765"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse1">James&nbsp;3:1-2</a></span> <q>Let him who is a wise man, and endued with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> among you, show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082766"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse13">James&nbsp;3:13</a></span> </p>

<h3>1. Of the life in common, and of the reason why the Church has begun to hold property.</h3>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the fact that hitherto the principle of living with all things in common has been in vigorous operation among good <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and is still so by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and most of all among those who have been chosen to the lot of the Lord, that is to say, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, even as we read in the Acts of the Apostles: <q>And the multitude of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> were of one heart and of one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. And with great power gave the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>: and great <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was upon them all. Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them down at the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need. And Joseph, who by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, the son of consolation), a Levite, and of the country of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> feet;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082767"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse32">Acts&nbsp;4:32-37</a></span> and so forth. Accordingly, as the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and others, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and the rest of the faithful, perceived that it might be of more advantage if they handed over to the churches over which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> presided the heritages and fields which they were in the way of selling, inasmuch as they might furnish a larger and better maintenance for the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who hold the common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not only in present but also in future times, out of the revenues of such property than out of the money for which they might at once be sold, they began to consign to the mother churches the property and lands which they were wont to sell, and got into the manner of living on the revenues of these.</p>

<h3>2. Of the persons by whom, and the uses for which, ecclesiastical property should be managed, and of the invaders thereof.</h3>

<p>The property, moreover, in the possession of the several parishes was left in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who hold the place of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; and it is so to this day, and ought to be so in all future time. And out of those possessions the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the faithful as their stewards ought to furnish to all who wish to enter the life in common all necessaries as they best can, so that none may be found in want among them. For the possessions of the faithful are also called oblations, because they are offered to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. They ought not therefore to be turned to any other uses than those of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in behoof of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> brethren before mentioned, and of the poor; for they are the offerings of the faithful, and they are redemption moneys for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (<em>pretia peccatorum</em>), and the patrimony of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and are given over to the Lord for the purpose already named. But if any one act otherwise (which may God forbid), let him take care lest he meet the condemnation of Ananias and Sapphira, and be found guilty of sacrilege, as those were who lied as to the price of the property designated, of whom we read thus in the before-cited passage of the Acts of the Apostles: <q>But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold land (<em>agrum</em>), and kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> feet. But Peter said to Ananias, Why has <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> tempted (<em>tentavit</em>) your heart to lie to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and to keep back part of the price of the land? Whilst it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your own power? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied unto men, but unto the Lord. And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down, and gave up the ghost. And great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> came on all them that heard <em>these things</em>. And the young men arose, and removed him (<em>amoverunt</em>), and carried him out, and buried him. And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what was done, came in. And Peter answered unto her, and said, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. Then Peter said unto her, How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a>? Behold, the feet of them which have buried your husband are at the door, and shall carry you out. Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost. And the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband. And great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> came upon all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and upon as many as heard these things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082768"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;5:1-11</a></span> These things, brethren, are carefully to be guarded against, and greatly to be feared. For the property of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not being like personal, but like common property, and property offered to the Lord, is to be dispensed with the deepest <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, in the spirit of faithfulness, and for no other objects than the above-named, lest those should incur the guilt of sacrilege who divert it from the hands to which it was consigned, and lest they should come under the punishment and death of Ananias and Sapphira, and lest (which is yet worse) they should become <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> maranatha, and lest, though their body may not fall dead like that of Ananias and Sapphira, their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is nobler than the body, should fall dead, and be cut off from the company of the faithful, and sink into the depths of the pit. Wherefore all must give heed to this matter, and watch in faithfulness, and avert the dishonour of such usurpation, lest possessions dedicated to the uses of things secret (or sacred) and heavenly be spoiled by any parties invading them. And if any one do so, then, after the sharp vengeance which is due to such a crime, and which is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> to be carried out against the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a>, let him be condemned to perpetual <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>, and cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> or consigned to life-long exile. For, according to the apostle, <span class="stiki" id="note082769"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:5</a></span> we ought to deliver such a man to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.</p>

<h3>3. As to any one's attempting to take from the Church the right of holding property.</h3>

<p>By the increase, therefore, and the mode of life which have been mentioned, the churches over which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> preside have grown so greatly with the help of the Lord, and the greater part of them are now in possession of so much property, that among them there is not a man who, selecting the life in common, is kept in poverty; but such an one receives all necessaries from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his ministers. Therefore, if any one in modern or in future time shall rise up and attempt to divert that property, let him be smitten with the judgment which has been already mentioned.</p>

<h3>4. Of the seats of the bishops.</h3>

<p>Furthermore, as to the fact that in the churches of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> there are found elevated seats set up and prepared like a throne, they show by these that the power of inspection and of judging, and the authority to loose and bind, are given to them by the Lord. Whence the Saviour Himself says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>Whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082770"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;18:18</a></span> And elsewhere: <q>Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Whose soever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye remit, are remitted unto them; and whose soever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye retain, they are retained.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082771"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;20:22-23</a></span> </p>

<h3>5. That no one should have intercourse with those with whom the bishop has no intercourse, or receive those whom he rejects.</h3>

<p>These things, then, we have set before you, most dearly beloved, in order that you may understand  the power of your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and give reverence to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in them, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them as your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; and in order that you may have no communication with those with whom they have none, and that you may not receive those whom they have cast out. For the judgment of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is greatly to be feared, although he may bind one <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, which, however, he ought to guard against with the utmost care.</p>

<h3>6. Of the engagement made in baptism, and of those who have given themselves to the life in common.</h3>

<p>And in exhorting you, we also admonish all who have embraced the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and who have taken from Christ the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, that you make your <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> vain in no respect, but keep steadfastly the engagement which you took upon yourselves in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, so that you may be found not reprobate, but worthy in His presence. And if any one of you has entered the life which has all things common, and has taken the vow to hold no private property, let him see to it that he make not his promise vain, but let him keep with all faithfulness this engagement which he has made to the Lord, so that he may acquire for himself not damnation, but a reward; for it is better for a man not to take a vow at all than not to discharge to the best of his ability the vow that he has made. For they who have made a vow, or taken on them the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and have not kept their vow, or have carried out their life in things <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, are punished more severely than those who have carried out their life without a vow, or have died without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but not without doing good works. For to this end have we received a reasonable mind by the gift of nature, and the renewal also of the second birth, that, according to the apostle, we may discern (<em>sapiamus</em>) rather things above, and not things on the earth; <span class="stiki" id="note082772"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse2">Colossians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note082773"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:19</a></span> For to what, most dearly beloved, does the wisdom of this world urge us, but to seek things that are hurtful, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> things that are to perish, and to neglect things that are healthful, and to esteem as of no value things that are lasting? It commends the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>, of which it is said, The <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note082774"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:10</a></span> and which has this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in special, that while it obtrudes the transitory, it hides from view the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; and while it looks on things that are outside, it does not look in upon things that lurk within; and while it seeks after strange things, it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that makes itself strange to him who does it.  Behold, to what does the wisdom of this world urge a man? To live in pleasures. Whence it is said: A <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> that lives in pleasure, is dead while she lives. <span class="stiki" id="note082776"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:6</a></span> It urges a man to feed the flesh with the softest delights, with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, and flames, to press the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with intemperance in food and wine, and to check the life of the spirit, and to put into his enemy's hand the sword to be used against himself. Behold, what is the counsel which the wisdom of this world gives? That those who are good should choose rather to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of mind they should be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> to be sinners, and should not bethink themselves of that terrible voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall be burned up like grass. </p>

<h3>7. Of the imposition of the bishop's hand.</h3>

<p>For all the faithful ought to receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by imposition of the hand of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, so that they may be found to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> fully; because when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is shed upon them, the believing heart is enlarged for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and steadfastness. We receive of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in order that we may be made spiritual; for the natural man receives not the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note082778"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> We receive of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in order that we may be wise to discern between good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the just, and to loathe the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, so as to withstand <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and resist luxury and various allurements, and impure and unworthy <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. We receive of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in order that, fired with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of life and the ardour of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, we may be able to raise our mind from things earthly to things heavenly and divine.&mdash; Given on the Nones of September,&mdash; that is, on the fifth day of the same month, in the consulship of the most illustrious Antonine and Alexander.</p>

<h2>The First Epistle of Pope Pontianus</h2>  

<p><strong>To Felix Subscribonius. On the honour to be bestowed on priests.</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Pontianus</span>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to Felix Subscribonius, greeting.</p>

<p>Our heart is exceedingly rejoiced with your goodness, in that you strive by all means in your power to carry out the practice of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion, and strengthen sad and destitute brethren in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and religion. Wherefore we implore the mercy of our Redeemer, that His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> may support us in all things, and that He may grant us to carry out in effect what He has given us to aspire after. In this good thing, therefore, the benefits of recompense are multiplied just in proportion as our <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the work increases. And because in all these things we need the assistance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, we implore with constant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> the clemency of Omnipotent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He may both grant us the desire for these good works which should ever be wrought by us, and give us power also to perform them, and direct us in that way, for the fruit of well-doing&mdash; which <em>way</em> the Pastor of pastors declared Himself to be&mdash; so that you may be able to carry out through Him, without whom nothing can be done, those good works which you have begun. Moreover, with respect to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Lord whom we have heard you aid against the plots of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, and whose <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you sustain, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye that in so doing ye please God greatly, who has called them to the service of Himself, and has honoured them with so intimate a fellowship with Him, that through them He accepts the oblations of others, and pardons their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and reconciles them with Him. They also make the body of the Lord with their own mouth (<em>proprio ore corpus Domini conficiunt</em>), and give it to the people. For of them it is said: He that hurts you, hurts me; and he that does you an injury, shall receive again that which he has done unrighteously.  And elsewhere: He that hears you, hears me; and he that despises you, despises me; and he that despises me, despises Him that sent me. <span class="stiki" id="note082782"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;10:16</a></span> Hence they are not to be molested, but honoured. And in them the Lord Himself is honoured, whose commission they execute. They accordingly, if they happen to fall, are to be raised up and sustained by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. And again, they are not to be accused by the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, or the hostile, or by the members of another <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> or religion. If they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, they are to be arraigned by the other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; further, they are to be held in check (<em>constringantur</em>) by the chief pontiffs, and they are not to be arraigned or restrained by seculars or by men of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> life. Not slight, therefore, is our grief in hearing that you have to sorrow for your brother's passing away (<em>transitu</em>). For which reason we beseech <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> to console you by the breathing (<em>aspiratione</em>) of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and keep you with heavenly guardianship from <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> and perverse men. For if you have to bear any turmoil of certain adversaries after his disease, do not think it strange though ye, who seek to enjoy good in your own country&mdash; that is, in the land of the living&mdash; have to bear <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things at the hands of men in a strange country. For the present life is a sojourning; and to him who sighs after the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fatherland, the place of his sojourning is a trial, however pleasant it may seem. And as to you who seek the fatherland, among the sighs which you heave I hear the groans also of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> oppression rising. And this happens by the wonderful dispensation of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that, while the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> calls you in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, this present world may cast back your affection from itself through the tribulations which it brings on, and that the mind may be so much the more easily delivered from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of this world, as it is also impelled while it is called. Therefore, as you have begun, give heed to the duty of hospitality; labour most urgently in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and tears; devote yourselves more liberally and freely now to those almsgivings which you have ever loved, in order that in the recompense the profit to you for your work may be greater in proportion as your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the labour has risen to higher degrees here.</p>

<p>Furthermore, hailing your goodness with paternal pleasantness, we beg you not to fail in the good works which you have begun. And may no one be able to turn you from them; but may the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who sojourn in those parts, fully discover by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ and Saint Peter the disposition of your charity in all things, and obtain the comforts of your favour in every necessity that may arise; to the end that all may be defended and helped by your aid, and that we, too, may owe you thanks, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> may make good <em>to you</em> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and that the blessed Apostle Peter, the chief of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, in whose <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you spend yourselves, may open the gate of that same <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.&mdash; Given on the 10th day before the kalends of February (the 23d of January), in the consulship of the most illustrious Severus and Quintianus. </p>

<h2>The Second Epistle of Pope Pontianus</h2>

<p><strong>To All Bishops. On brotherly love, and on avoiding the evil.</strong></p>

<p>Pontianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and universal Church, to all who worship the Lord aright, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the divine worship, greeting.</p>

<p>Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will. <span class="stiki" id="note082784"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;1:14</a></span> These words, most beloved, are not the words of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and they were not devised by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sense, but were uttered by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> at the birth of the Saviour. And from these words it can be understood without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> by all that peace is given by the Lord, not to men of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will, but to men of good will. Whence the Lord, speaking by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, says: <q>How good is God to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, even to such as are of a clean heart! But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had nearly slipped: for I was <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> at the unrighteous, when I saw the prosperity of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</q>  Of the good, however, the Truth says in His own person, <q>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082786"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> And they are not the pure in heart who think <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, or things hurtful to their brethren; for he who is the faithful man devises nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The faithful man, accordingly, loves rather to hear things which are becoming, than to speak things which are not becoming. And if any one is faithful, let him see to it that he speak no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and lay no snares in the way of any one. In this, then, are the children of God distinguished from the children of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For the children of God always think and strive to do things which are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and give help unceasingly to their brethren, and wish to injure no one. But, on the other hand, the children of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> are always meditating things <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and hurtful, because their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And of them the Lord, speaking by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah, says: <q>I will utter my judgments against them touching all their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082787"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse16">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:16</a></span> <q>Wherefore I will yet plead with you, says the Lord; and with your children's children will I plead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082788"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse9">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:9</a></span> <q>Behold, I frame <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against you, and devise a device against you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082789"><a href="../bible/jer018.htm#verse11">Jeremiah&nbsp;18:11</a></span> These things, brethren, are greatly to be feared, and to be guarded against by all; for the man on whom the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> may fall will not depart unhurt. And therefore let every one see to it carefully that he neither contrive nor do against a brother what he would not wish to have to endure himself. And let not the man of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> come under the suspicion even of saying or doing what he would not wish to have to endure himself. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> suspected, or hostile or litigious, and those who are not of good conversation, or whose life is reprehensible, and those who do not hold and teach the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, have been debarred from being either accusers or witnesses by our predecessors with apostolic authority; and we too remove them from that function, and exclude them from it in times to come, lest those lapse wilfully whom we ought to keep in and save; lest not only (which may God forbid!) the predicted <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> should fall upon both, but we also should perish (which may God forbid!) through their fault. For it is written, <q>Have they made you the master <em>of a feast?</em> Take care for them, that you may be merry on their account, and receive as your crown the ornament of esteem, and find approbation of your election.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082790"><a href="../bible/sir032.htm#verse1">Sirach&nbsp;32:1-3</a></span> For the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> word affects the heart, out of which proceed these four objects, good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, life and death; and the tongue in its assiduous action is what determines these. Wherefore the before-named parties are altogether to be avoided; and until the before-noted matters are investigated, and the parties are found to be clear of such, they are not to be received: for the right <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is to give heed to the commandments, and to depart from all iniquity. <q>To depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is a thing pleasing to the Lord, and to forsake unrighteousness is <em>a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of</em> praise.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082791"><a href="../bible/sir035.htm#verse1">Sirach&nbsp;35:1-3</a></span> For it is written, <q>Love your friend, and be faithful unto him. But if you betray his secrets, follow no more after him. For as a man who destroys his friend, so is he who destroys (loses) the friendship of his neighbour. And as one that lets a bird go out of his hand, so are you that has let your neighbour go and shall not get him again. Follow after him no more, for he is far off. For he has escaped like a roe out of the snare, because his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is wounded. You will not be able to bind him any more, and there is reconciliation for the reviled. But to betray the secrets of a friend is the desperation of a wretched <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. He that winks with the eye works <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and no one will cast him off. When you are present, he will despise his own mouth, and express his wonder at your discourse; but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> your sayings. I have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> many things, but nothing like him; and the Lord will <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> him. Whoso casts a stone on high, it will fall upon his own head, and a deceitful stroke of the deceitful will make wounds. Whoso digs a pit shall fall therein; and he that sets a stone in his neighbour's way will fall thereon; and he that places a snare for another will perish therein. He that works mischief, it shall fall upon him, and he shall not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence it comes on him. Mockery and reproach are from the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>; and vengeance, as a lion, shall be in wait for them. They that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at the fall of the righteous shall perish in the snare, and anguish shall consume them before they die. Anger and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> are both abominations, and the sinful man shall have them both.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082792"><a href="../bible/sir027.htm#verse17">Sirach&nbsp;27:17-30</a></span> He that will be avenged shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will surely keep his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Forgive your neighbour the hurt that he has done unto you, and then shall your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be forgiven you when you pray. One man bears <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against another; and does he ask redress of God? He shows no mercy to a man which is like himself; and does he ask forgiveness of the Most High for his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? He, though he is flesh, nourishes <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; and does he ask pardon of God? Who will entreat for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? Remember your end, and let enmity cease; for corruption and death impend on commandments. Remember the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and bear no <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> to your neighbour. Remember the covenant of the Highest, and look down upon (<em>despice</em>) the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of your neighbour. Abstain from strife, and you shall diminish your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>For a <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> man kindles strife; and a sinful man will disquiet friends, and make enmity among them that be at peace. For even as the trees of the wood are, so will the fire burn; and as a man's strength is, so will his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> be; and as his riches are, so will he make his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> rise. An hastened contention will kindle a fire, and an hastening quarrel will shed blood, and a testifying (<em>testificans</em>) tongue will bring death. If you blow upon the spark, it will burn like a fire; and if you spit upon it, it will be extinguished: and both these come out of the mouth. Cursed be the whisperer and doubled-tongued, for such have troubled many that were at peace. A third (<em>tertia</em>) tongue has disquieted many, and driven them from nation to nation: the fortified cities of the rich it has pulled down, and overthrown the houses of great men. It has subverted the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of peoples, and has destroyed strong nations. A third tongue has cast out truthful  <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and deprived them of their labours. Whoso hearkens unto it shall never find rest, and never dwell quietly. The stroke of the whip makes marks in the flesh, but the stroke of the tongue will break bones. Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not in such manner as those who have perished by their tongue. Well is he that is defended from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tongue, who has not passed into the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> thereof, and who has not drawn the yoke thereof, nor has been bound with the bands of it; for the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the band thereof is a band of brass. The death thereof is the vilest death, and the grave were better than it. The perseverance thereof shall not abide; but it shall hold the ways of the unrighteous, and its flame shall not burn the righteous. Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it, and it shall burn in them, and not be quenched; and it shall be sent upon them as a lion, and hurt them as a leopard. Hedge your ears about with thorns, and listen not to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tongue; and make a door for your mouth, and bars for your ears. Smelt (<em>confla</em>) your gold and silver, and make a balance for your words, and right curbs for your mouth.

<h2>The Epistle of Pope Anterus</h2> 

<p><strong>On the translation of bishops and of episcopal seats.</strong></p>

<p>To the brethren, most dearly beloved, constituted to be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the provinces of B&oelig;tica and Toletana, Bishop Anterus sends greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>I should wish, my dearest brethren, always to receive the glad account of your sincere <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and peace, so that the signs of your welfare might be promoted in turn by the dissemination of our letters among you, if our ancient enemy should give us quiet and deliverance from his attacks; who was a liar from the beginning, <span class="stiki" id="note082799"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the rival of man&mdash; in order to deceive whom he first deceived himself&mdash;the adversary of modesty, the master of luxury. He feeds on cruelties; he is punished by abstinence; he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, and his ministers preach, to that effect, as he declares them to be superfluous, having no hope of the future, and echoing that sentence of the apostle, in which he says, <q>Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082800"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse32">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:32</a></span> O miserable boldness! O subtlety of a desperate mind! For he exhorts to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, and puts concord to flight. And because the mind of man is easily drawn over to the worse part, and chooses rather to walk by the broad way than laboriously to take its course by the narrow way, for this reason, brethren most dearly beloved, follow ye the better, and always leave the worse behind you. Do good, avoid <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, in order that you may be found to be the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Lord in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>Now, of the transference of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, on which subject it has been your wish to consult the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> seat of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye that that may lawfully be done for the sake of the common good, or when it is absolutely necessary, but not at the mere will or bidding of any individual. Peter, our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> master, and the prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, was translated for the sake of the common good from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in order that he might be in a position there of doing more service. Eusebius also was transferred from a certain minor city to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> by apostolic authority. In like manner Felix, on account of the doctrine and the good life which he maintained, was translated by the common consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the people from the city in which, on the election of the citizens, he had been ordained, to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>. For that man is not chargeable with shifting from city to city who does not do that of his own inclination or by the force of ambition, but who is transferred for the general good, or in virtue of some necessity, by the counsel and with the consent of the chief parties. Nor can he be said to transfer himself from a smaller city to a larger, who is placed in that position not by his own self-seeking or his own choice, but either as being driven out of his own proper seat by force, or as being compelled by some necessity, and who without <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and in humility has been translated and installed there by others for the good of the place or the people: for man looks on the countenance, but the Lord sees the heart. And the Lord, speaking by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, says, <q>The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the thoughts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that they are vanity.</q>  That man, therefore, does not change his seat who does not change his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Nor does he change his city who is changed not of his own will, but by the decision and election of others. And accordingly he does not shift from city to city who does not leave his own city for the sake of gain to himself, or of his own choice, but who, as has already been said, has been translated to another city either in consequence of being driven out of his own seat, or compelled by some necessity, or in virtue of the election and injunction of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and people. For as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have power regularly to ordain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and other orders of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, so, as often as any matter of advantage or necessity constrains them, they have power in the above-mentioned manner both to transfer and to install. As you have asked our opinion in these matters, though they are not subjects unknown to you, we give you these things in charge to hold them, lest, through the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of some, that which is better and more profitable be avoided, and what is more profitless be taken up, even as we read in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Woe unto you, hypocrites! For you pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of mint, and anise, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. You blind guides, which strain out a gnat and swallow a camel.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082802"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;23:23-24</a></span> What is lawful is <em>with them</em> not lawful, and what is not lawful is lawful. Even as Jannes and Mambres <span class="stiki" id="note082803"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:8</a></span> resisted the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so do they, being reprobate in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and lovers of pleasure rather than of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, teach that that is unlawful which is lawful, to wit, that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should shift from city to city in the manner already noted; and what is unlawful they teach as lawful, to wit, to omit to show mercy to those who endure straits: that is to say, they deny that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> belonging to another city should be bestowed for good, or for necessity's sake, upon those who have no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and who want the sacred episcopal ministry; and that another episcopal seat should be assigned to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who endure <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> or straits. They contradict the sacred Scripture also, which testifies that God desires mercy rather than judgment. </p>

<p>What greater charity, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, can there be, or what more profitable service of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, on the part of any one to another, than to deliver him from the darkness of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and the thick darkness of inexperience, and restore him, in fine, by the nutriment of the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not for gain indeed, or ambition, but for instruction and edification? [For he becomes, so to speak, the hand for the maimed, the foot for the lame, the eye for the blind, <span class="stiki" id="note082805"><a href="../bible/job029.htm#verse15">Job&nbsp;29:15</a></span> who unlocks the treasure of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to one wrapped in the darkness of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and opens up to such an one the brightness of the light and the ways of the Lord.] </p>

<p>Now for both parties&mdash; namely, for those who endure a famine of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who endure straits, when they are installed in other cities for the common good&mdash; no small degree of mercy is shown. And they who deny this, although they have the form of godliness, do yet deny the power thereof. <span class="stiki" id="note082807"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:5</a></span> For in such a matter I make no recognition of race (<em>prosapiam</em>). If, however, any one of the wise, whom the stress of this storm (or season) has allied with other leaders among the unwise, is stained with a participation in their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, yet the excellence of the wise man, although he may chance to be privy to their offenses, makes him incapable of giving himself as a leader to sinners. The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of public good and necessity is one thing, and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of self-seeking, and presumption, or private inclination, is another thing. On account of self-seeking, or presumption, or private inclination, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are not to be transferred from one city to another, but only on account of public good and necessity. And this is a matter which no one denies, except those of whom it is said, <q>They have erred through wine; they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the seer; they have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of judgment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082808"><a href="../bible/isa028.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;28:7</a></span> For if I were constrained to open up in narration things that have been brought to end, I would show you that no comfort comes from the comparison of such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. But, most dearly beloved, <q>stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths of the Lord, and see what is the good way and the right, and walk therein, and you shall find rest for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082809"><a href="../bible/jer006.htm#verse16">Jeremiah&nbsp;6:16</a></span> And, to speak according to the word of Wisdom: <q>Love righteousness, you that be judges of the earth. Think of the Lord in goodness, and in simplicity of heart seek Him. For He is found of them that tempt Him not, and shows Himself unto such as do not distrust Him. For froward thoughts separate from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and His power, when it is tried, reproves the unwise. For into a malicious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> wisdom shall not enter, nor dwell in the body that is subject unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> spirit of discipline will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide when unrighteousness comes in. For wisdom is a benign spirit, and will not acquit a blasphemer of His words. For God is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of his reins, and a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue. For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> has filled the world, and that which contains all things has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the voice. Therefore he that speaks unrighteous things cannot be hid; neither shall vengeance, when it punishes, pass by him. For inquisition shall be made into the counsels of the ungodly. And the sound of his words shall come unto the Lord, and unto the manifestation of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; for the ear of jealousy hears all things, and the noise of murmurings shall not be hid. Therefore beware of murmuring, which is unprofitable; and refrain your tongue from backbiting, for there is no word so secret that it shall go for nought. The mouth that belies slays the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Seek not death in the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of your life, and pull not upon yourself  destruction with the works of your hands; for God made not death, neither has He pleasure in the destruction of the living. For He created all things that they might have their being, and He wished the nations of the world to be healthful. There is no poison of destruction in them, nor the kingdom of death upon the earth of the living. Righteousness is perpetual and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, but unrighteousness is the acquisition of death. And ungodly men with their hands and words called it to them; and when they thought to have it their friend, they consumed to nought, and made a covenant with it; because they are worthy of death who take part with it.</q>  <q>For they said, reasoning with themselves, but not aright, The time of our life is short and tedious; and in the death of a man there is no remedy, neither was there any man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have returned from the grave. For we are born of nothing, and we shall be hereafter as though we had never been. For the breath in our nostrils is as smoke, and speech is a little spark for the moving of our heart; which being extinguished, our body shall be turned into ashes, and our spirit shall vanish as the soft air. And our life shall pass as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist that is driven away with the beams of the sun, and overcome with the heat thereof. And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall have our works in remembrance. For our time is a very shadow that passes away, and after our end there is no returning; for it is fast sealed, and no man shall come again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082811"><a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse1">Wisdom&nbsp;2:1-5</a></span> And for this reason every one must see to it that he keep himself with all care, and watch himself for his own good, so that when his last day and the end of his life come upon him, he may not pass over to everlasting death, but to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. For the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of those put under us are judged by us, but our own does God judge. Sometimes, moreover, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are perverted through the fault of the people, to the end that those fall more precipitately who follow them. When the head languishes, the other members of the body are affected thereby. And viler are those who corrupt the life and morals of the good, than those who spoil the property and goods of others. Let each one take care that he have neither an itching tongue nor itching ears; that is to say, that he neither be a detractor of others himself, nor listen to others in their detractions. <q> You sat,</q> says he, <q>and spoke against your brother; and you <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> your own mother's son.</q>  Let every individual abstain from a detracting tongue, and keep a guard upon his own words, and understand that all that they say of others shall enter into the judgment wherewith they themselves shall be judged. No one readily refers to an unwilling auditor. Let it be the care of all of you, most dearly beloved, to keep not only your eyes, but also your tongue, pure. And let not another house ever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by your means what is done in any man's house. Let all have the simplicity of the dove, that they devise not guile against any one; and the subtlety of the serpent, that they be not ever thrown by the crafty designs of others. It does not belong to my <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> station and measure to judge others, and to say anything unfavourable of the ministers of the churches. Far be it from me that I should say anything unfavourable of those who are the successors to the apostolic status, and make the body of Christ with their sacred mouth; by whose instrumentality we too are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and who have the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and exercise judgment before the day of judgment. Moreover, it is contained in the ancient law, that whoever has not given <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should either be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> outside the camp by the people, or with his neck beneath the sword should expiate his presumption by his blood. <span class="stiki" id="note082813"><a href="../bible/deu017.htm">Deuteronomy&nbsp;xvii</a></span> </p>

<p>Now, however, the disobedient is cut off by spiritual chastisement; and being cast out of the church, is torn by the rabid mouth of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.  For it becomes those who have God in their heritage, to serve God free from all the hindrances of the world, so that they may be able to say, <q>The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance.</q>  <q>O how good and pleasant is Your Spirit, O Lord, in all things!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082816"><a href="../bible/wis012.htm#verse1">Wisdom&nbsp;12:1</a></span> And You spare all because they are Yours, O Lord, who loves <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. <em>Therefore chasten them</em> little by little that offend, and warn them of those things wherein they offend, and address them, that leaving their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in You, O Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note082817"><a href="../bible/wis012.htm#verse2">Wisdom&nbsp;12:2</a></span> <q>But You, our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, art gracious and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, long-suffering, and in mercy ordering all things.

But fornication, and all uncleanness, or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, let it not be once named among you, as becomes <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient; but rather giving of thanks.

For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord: walk as children of light (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>), proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever is made manifest (<em>manifestatur</em>) is light. Wherefore He says, Awake, you that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light. See then that you walk circumspectly, brethren, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; speaking to yourselves in psalms, and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord; giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, submitting yourselves one to another in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082821"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse1">Ephesians&nbsp;5:1-21</a></span> Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and the apostolic seat, <q>that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> and our Father, which has loved us, and has given us everlasting consolation and good hope through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, may comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good work and word.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082822"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:15-17</a></span> <q>Finally, brethren, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, even as it is with you, and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men: for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<h2>The First Epistle of Pope Fabian</h2>

<p><strong>To All the Ministers of the Church Catholic. Of those who ought not to be admitted to clear themselves, and of the duty of having no fellowship with the excommunicated.</strong></p>

<p>To the dearly-beloved brethren in the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in all regions, Fabian sends greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>By the divine precepts and the apostolic institutes, we are admonished to watch in behoof of the position of all the churches with unwearied interest. Whence it follows that you ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is being done in things sacred in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">church of Rome</a>, in order that, by following her example, you may be found to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> children of her who is called your mother. Accordingly, as we have received the institution from our fathers, we maintain seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> in the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> distributed over seven districts of the state, who attend to the services enjoined on them week by week, and on the Lord's days and the solemn festivals, in concert with the subdeacons, and acolytes, and servants of the succeeding orders, and hold themselves in readiness every hour for religious duty, and for the discharge of all that is enjoined upon them. In like manner ought ye also to do throughout your different cities, as may be convenient, that religious duty may be discharged <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> and regularly, without any delay or negligence. Furthermore, we have ordained in like manner seven subdeacons who shall stand by (<em>imminerent</em>) the seven notaries, and bring into one full and accurate account the histories of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and lay them before us for our examination. And this, too, we urge you all to do, so that no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> or questioning of these things may arise in later times; <q>for whatsoever things were written, were written for our learning.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082827"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;15:4</a></span> And whatsoever things are written in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in our times, are directed to the learning of future times. And therefore we enjoin these duties to be put in charge of the most faithful, that nothing false may be found in them, from which an offense (which may God forbid) may arise to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. For this reason also we beg it of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in paternal benignity, that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church may now find the good-will of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in all things, and obtain the comforts of your favour whenever there is necessity. And as the goodness of your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> affords us the assurance that we ought to distrust it in nothing, but rather commit these things in all confidence to you as to wise sons of our church; so, small importance being attached to opportune occasions, your <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> ought to exert itself the more strenuously in labours, and keep off reproaches by all possible means, and with all <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. We exhort you also, according to the word of the apostle, to be <q>steadfast and immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; forasmuch as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your labour is not vain in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082828"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse58">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:58</a></span> And in another place: <q>Watch ye, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and stand fast in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Quit you like men, and be strong. Let all things be done with charity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082829"><a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;16:13-14</a></span> Furthermore, we desire you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, that in our times, as our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> embarrassed us, and that ancient enemy who always goes about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour, <span class="stiki" id="note082830"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:8</a></span> instigated him, Novatus came up out of Africa, and separated Novatianus and certain other confessors of Christ from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and persuaded them into the acceptance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doctrine. From such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, brethren, keep yourselves aloof, and beware of all who hold a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and doctrine different from that which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and their successors have held and taught, lest (which may God forbid) going after him ye fall into the toils of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, and be bound with his fetters. Wherefore with most earnest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> we beg it of your brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that you may deem it fit to remember our insignificance in your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, beseeching and entreating the Lord of heaven that we, as well as our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, redeemed with His precious blood, may be delivered from the toils of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, who lies in wait for us; and from troublesome and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, and that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> may have free course and be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doctrine of them, and of all who teach things contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, may be overthrown and perish. We beseech you also to be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> supplications, that our God and Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who will have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved, and no one to perish, <span class="stiki" id="note082831"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:4</a></span> may, by His vast omnipotence, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> their hearts to turn again to sound doctrine and to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in order that they may be recovered from the toils of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who are held captive by him, and be united with the children of our mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Be mindful also of your brethren, and have pity upon them, and labour for them by all means in your power, that they be not lost, but be saved unto the Lord by your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and other efforts of your goodness. So act therefore in these matters that you may approve yourselves as <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> and faithful children of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, and that you may obtain the recompense of reward. These men, and all else who do not teach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine, and hold not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, cannot act as accusers of any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> believer, because they are branded with <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>, and are cut off from the bosom of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the sword of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, until their return to correct conversation and belief. Hence by apostolic authority, and in agreement with all the sons of the same apostolic and universal Church, we resolve that all who come under suspicion with respect to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cannot be admitted as accusers of those who hold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> creed; for suspicions are always to be set aside. Rightly therefore are charges which are preferred by those who are objects of suspicion in the matter of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, rejected. Neither are they at all to be credited who are unacquainted with the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Trinity. In like manner we set aside and withdraw from all part in the accusing of the faithful, all those whom the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers in times past and times future alike <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a>. Accordingly, the believing ought always to be kept distinct from the unbelieving, and the righteous from the unrighteous; since the unbelieving and evil-minded, by every means in their power, are always troubling the believing, and striving to undo them; and consequently they are not to be received, but rejected and kept entirely at a distance, lest they may undo or defame the believing. For this reason, dearly beloved, beware of the pit of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, into which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> many have fallen. Beware of the snares (or darts) of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and of the efforts of the ancient enemy, by which we have seen even those closely connected with us fall wounded before us. Watch the nooses of the liers in wait, by which they are wont to strangle associates and comrades. Follow not such, but keep them far off from you. Be, according to the voice of Truth, wise as serpents and harmless as doves. <span class="stiki" id="note082832"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;10:16</a></span> See to it that you neither run nor labour in vain; but, sustained by each other's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and supplications, strive ye to do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and from those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom I have mentioned, if they show themselves incorrigible, keep yourselves separate in all things. In like manner keep yourselves separate from all those of whom the apostle makes mention when he says, <q>with such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, no, not to eat;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082833"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:11</a></span> since these latter, as well as the former, are to be rejected, and are not to be admitted before they have given satisfaction to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For those with whom it is not lawful to eat are manifestly separated from all intercourse with the rest of the brethren until such satisfaction is given. Wherefore they ought not and cannot be admitted to the preferring of charges against the faithful, but they ought to be debarred from their society until the satisfaction already mentioned is given, lest these too should be made like them, or underlie their excommunication; for to this effect have the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> decreed, saying, With the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> no fellowship is to be held. And if any one, setting aside the rules wittingly, sings with the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> in his house, or speaks or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> in company with them, that man is to be deprived of the privilege of communion. Such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, therefore, are in all things to be guarded against, and are not to be received, because, according to the apostle, not only those who commit such things are condemned, but also those who consent with those who do them. <span class="stiki" id="note082834"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;1:32</a></span> Whence also the blessed chief of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, Peter, addressing the people at the ordination of Clement, says this among other things:  If this Clement is hostile to any one on account of his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, wait not ye for his saying directly to you, Be not on terms of friendship with this man. But mark ye carefully his will as you ought, and second it without need of direct injunction; and separate yourselves from that man to whom you perceive him to be inimical, and speak not with those with whom he speaks not, in order that every one who may be in fault, as he desires to possess the friendship of all of you, may be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in effecting a reconciliation all the more quickly with him who presides over all, so that he may return to spiritual well-being (<em>redeat et salutem</em>) hereby, when he begins to yield <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the charges of the president.</p>

<p>If, however, any one is not friendly, and speaks with those with whom he (his chief) speaks not, such an one belongs to those who seek to exterminate the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>; and though he seems to be with you in body, he is against you in mind and heart. And such an one is a much more dangerous enemy than those who are without, and who are openly hostile. For this man under the guise of friendship acts the part of an enemy, and scatters and ruins the church. And therefore, dearly beloved, in these apostolic institutes we warn and teach you, that your charity, being instructed therein (<em>effecta certior</em>), may hereafter study to act with greater care and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, so that perverse and unbelieving men may not have the power of injuring the faithful and well-disposed; for the hope of such, and of all the ungodly, is like dust that is blown away with the wind; and like a thin froth that is driven away with the storm; and like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there with a tempest, and as the remembrance of a guest of a single day that passes away. <span class="stiki" id="note082836"><a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse14">Wisdom&nbsp;5:14</a></span> With the utmost care, dearly beloved, are such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to be guarded against, and avoided, and rejected, if they show themselves injurious. For the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the world, no less than those of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, do not admit the injurious, but reject them. Whence it is written, <q>The mouth of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> devours iniquity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082837"><a href="../bible/pro019.htm#verse28">Proverbs&nbsp;19:28</a></span> And the Lord, speaking by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, says, <q>With the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> you will show yourself <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; and with the froward you will show yourself froward; and with the excellent you will show yourself excellent (<em>electus</em>); and with the innocent man you will show yourself innocent.</q>  And the apostle says, <q>Evil communications corrupt good manners.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082839"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse33">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:33</a></span> Wherefore, as has already been indicated, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are always to be avoided and shunned, and the good and rightly-disposed are to be steadfastly followed, in order that, as far as possible, we may avoid the peril of sloth. And lest this pest may be spread abroad more widely, let us cut it off from us with all possible severity; for the temerity of presumption does not intervene where there is the diligence of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Let every one of you, sustained by this apostolic representation, act according to his strength, and study in brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and in godly <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to keep his own manners correct, and to help each other, and to abide in charity, and to keep himself in the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> unceasingly, in order that we may praise the Lord together, and give Him thanks always without wearying. Fare well in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, dearly beloved, and with the Lord's help strive to fulfil to the best of your ability the things before mentioned.&mdash; Given on the first day of July, in the consulship of the most illustrious Maximinus (or, Maximus) and <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Africanus</a>. </p>

<h2>The Second Epistle of Pope Fabian</h2>

<p><strong>To All the Bishops of the East. That the chrism  should be renewed with consecration every year, and that the old supply should be set aside to be burnt in the churches; also concerning the accusing of priests, and on the duty of the sheep not to dare to blame their shepherd unless he errs in the faith.</strong></p>

<p>Fabian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the East, and to the whole body of the faithful, greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>Your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the seat of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> requires counsels which we neither can nor ought to deny you. It is clear, moreover, that our predecessors did this for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of many districts; and brotherly charity and the debt of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> impose the duty of so doing also upon us who, by the bountiful goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are placed in the same seat. Care, therefore, is to be had by your solicitude, that neither remissness may avail to neglect, nor presumption be able to disturb, those things which have been ordained by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and their successors, and established under the inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But as it was proper that that should be defined which the use of right order required, so what has been so defined ought not to be violated.</p>

<h3>1. That new chrism should be made every year, and the old be burnt.</h3>

<p>Now, among other matters, in your letter we find it stated that certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of your district  adopt a different practice from yours and ours, and do not prepare the chrism at the Lord's supper every year, but keep it in use for two or three, making such a supply of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> chrism once for all. For they say, as we find in the letter referred to, that balsam cannot be got every year; and besides that, even though it were got, there would be no necessity for preparing chrism every year, but that, so long as the one preparation of chrism is sufficiently large, they have no need to make another. They are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, however, who think so; and in making such statements they speak like madmen rather than men in their right senses. For on that day the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, after supping with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and washing their feet, according to the tradition which our predecessors received from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and left to us, taught them to prepare the chrism. That washing of their feet signifies our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as it is completed and confirmed by the unction of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> chrism. For as the solemn observance of that day is to be kept every year, so the preparing of that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> chrism is to be attended to every year, and it is to be renewed from year to year and given to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. For <em>the material of</em> this new sacrament is to be made anew every year, and on the day already named; and the old supply is to be burned in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches. These things we have received from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and their successors, and we commit them to your keeping. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> church of Rome and that of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> have been guardians of these things from the times of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: these things also the churches of Jerusalem and Ephesus maintain. Presiding over these churches, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> taught these things, and ordained that the old chrism should be burnt, and permitted them to use it no longer than one year, and commanded them thereafter to use the new, and not the old material. If any one, therefore, ventures to go against these things, let him understand that the door of indulgence is barred against him on your part and on that of all right-minded men: for the perverse doctrine of most depraved minds, while it uses the reins too indulgently, slips into the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of presumption; and it can by no means be cast out, unless it is cleared of all support and correction on the part of the intelligent. And those usages which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church throughout the whole world uniformly observes with respect to the divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and towards the subjects of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, are not to be regarded with indifferent concern, lest we make way for purposeless efforts and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a>. We ought not, therefore, to bring over the untaught minds of the faithful to such practices as we have named, because they should be instructed rather than played upon. For good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> make for our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> prick us with the stings of sorrow. But here, however we are situated, we are among the hands of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> and the teeth of raging wolves, and the contumacious are put in the place of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sheep. And it is by the barking of the dogs and the staff of the shepherd that the fury of the wolves is checked. Those wounds, moreover, which cannot be healed by remedies, must be cut out with the knife. Neither can we keep silence, for, in seeking here to call back some from things unlawful, we are impelled by the instinct of our office, having been set on the watchtowers by the Lord with this object, that we should prove the diligence of our watchfulness by checking things that should be prohibited, and deciding for things that should be observed.</p>

<h3>2. Of the right of bishops not to be accused or hurt by detraction.</h3>

<p>You desired also to consult us, as we find in the above-mentioned letter of yours, on the subject of the accusing of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>&mdash;a thing which, as we learn also from the same epistle, is exceedingly frequent among you. You have intimated, besides, that very many notice that not a few in places of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> dignity do not live in a manner conformable to the discourses and <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> with which the people are served by their means. O miserable men, who in looking at these forget Christ, who long since indeed told us how that the law of God should be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, rather than that those should be looked to for imitation who do not the things which they say; and bearing with the traitor himself even to the end, He sent him also along with the rest to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had no such custom, neither did they teach that it was one fit to be had. And to like effect their successors also, foreseeing by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> things to come, have determined largely on such subject. Besides, as you read in the Acts of the Apostles, <q>There was at that time among them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> one heart and one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082842"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse32">Acts&nbsp;4:32</a></span> For there was no laying of accusations against each other among them, except what was friendly; neither ought there ever to be such among their followers or among <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>: for the Lord says, <q>Do not that to another which you would not have done to yourself.</q>  And He says also, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself;</q>  and, Love works no ill to his neighbour. <span class="stiki" id="note082845"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;13:10</a></span> In accordance herewith, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves and their successors decreed  of old time that those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should not be admitted to lay accusations who were under suspicion, or who but yesterday, or the day before, or a little time ago, were at enmity, as they come thus under suspicion, or who are not of good conversation, or whose life is reprehensible, or who are doubtful in the matter of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In like manner is it decided to be with those whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and life and liberty are unknown, or who are marked with the stains of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>, or entangled in the snares of offenses. Again, those have neither the right nor the power to accuse the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who are incapable themselves of being made <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> legitimately, and are not of their order; for just as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the other members of the clerical order are debarred from laying accusations against the secular <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, so these latter, too, should be debarred and excluded from the right of bringing charges against the former. And as the former should not be admired by the latter, so the latter should not be admired by the former: for as the conversation of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Lord ought to be something separate from the conversation of these others, so should they be separate from them also in the matter of litigation; <q>for the servant of the Lord ought not to strive.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082846"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:24</a></span> To the utmost of your power, dearly beloved brethren, prohibit such accusations, and all unrighteous and injurious emulations, because contention is to be avoided by all means. <q>For a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man will fall seven times in a day, and will rise again; but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall fall into mischief. Rejoice not when your enemy falls,</q> says Solomon, <q>and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles; lest the Lord see it, and it displease Him, and He turn away His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> from him. Fret not yourself because of evil-doers, neither be <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> at the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> have not the hope of the future, and the candle of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall be put out. Envy not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men, neither be desirous to be with them; for their mind meditates rapine, and their lips speak deceits.</q>  Dearly beloved, beware of these things. Ponder these things, and minister comfort to the brethren in all things; for, as the Truth says in His own person, <q>By this shall all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, if you have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one to another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082848"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;13:35</a></span> For if in things secular each man's right and his proper position are kept for him, how much more ought there to be no confusion induced in matters of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order! And this is a right which will be duly observed if no deference is paid to mere power, but all to equity. Whence it is an established duty, that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of each several district should exercise a watchful care over all those who live under their rule, and in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God should dispose of all cases in which they are concerned, and of all matters in which they are interested. It is therefore extremely inequitable that any <em><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a></em> should neglect their own cases, and mix themselves up with those of others. But those whose part it is to ordain such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and by whom they have been already ordained, ought to order the life and judgment of such by the exercise of a competent and regular administration; for, as the law says, <q>Cursed is every one that removes his neighbour's landmarks. And all the people said <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082849"><a href="../bible/deu027.htm#verse17">Deuteronomy&nbsp;27:17</a></span> To this therefore, brethren, has God foreordained you, and all who hold the highest office of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, that you should put all <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> out of the way, and cut off presumption, and help those who labour in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and give no occasion for their reproach and trouble, but bring assistance to him who endures <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> and reproach, and cut off him who works <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> and reproach, and act for the help of the Lord in His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The Lord, moreover, has chosen the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for Himself, that they should <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to Him, and offer oblations to their Lord. He commanded the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> also to be under them in their ministries. Whence He speaks to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in these terms: <q>And Eleazar the son of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> shall be chief over the chief of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082850"><a href="../bible/num003.htm#verse32">Numbers&nbsp;3:32</a></span> For of these the Lord spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in this wise: <q>Take the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> instead of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> among the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the cattle of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> instead of their cattle; and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> shall be mine: I am the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082851"><a href="../bible/num003.htm#verse45">Numbers&nbsp;3:45</a></span> If the Lord willed the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> to be His own, how much more has He taken the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for Himself! And of these He says: <q>If any stranger comes near, he shall be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082852"><a href="../bible/num001.htm#verse51">Numbers&nbsp;1:51</a></span> All objects, moreover, that are the Lord's are to be handled carefully, and are not lightly to be injured; for even among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, those are reckoned faithful who attend to the interests of their masters rightly, and deal with them faithfully, and rightly observe the commands of their masters, and transgress them not. And those, on the other hand, are reputed unfaithful who deal with the interests of their masters carelessly and negligently, and despise their commands, and do not observe them as they ought.</p>

<p>Accordingly we have set these matters before you, in order that those who now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this; viz., that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, too, whom the Lord has taken to Himself from among all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and has willed to be His own, are not to be dealt with lightly, nor injured, nor rashly accused or reprehended, save by their masters, seeing that the Lord has chosen to reserve their causes to Himself, and ministers vengeance according to His own judgment. For in these and other precepts of the Lord the faithful are distinguished, and the unfaithful at the same time disapproved. For these are rather to be borne with by the faithful than made subjects of reproach (<em>exprobrandi</em>); just as there is chaff with the wheat even to the last winnowing, and as there are bad fish with good even on to their separation, which is yet to be on the shore&mdash;that is to say, at the end of the world. By no means, then, can that man be condemned by a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> examination, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has reserved for His own judgment, that the purpose of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to which He has decreed to save what had perished, may be unalterable. And consequently, as His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> suffers no change, let no man presume on matters which are not conceded to him. And herein is the meaning of that word which the apostle speaks: <q>Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082853"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:7</a></span> To this, too, our Lord's word may refer: <q>And if any man will take away your coat, and sue you at the law, let him have your cloak also.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082854"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;5:40</a></span> And in another place: <q>Of him that takes away your goods, ask them not again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082855"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;6:30</a></span> Moreover, there are certain things which might be thought most trivial were they not shown in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> to be of more serious import. Who would ever consider the man who says to his brother <q>You fool</q> worthy of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell-fire</a>, were it not that the Truth Himself told us so? <span class="stiki" id="note082856"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;5:22</a></span> Those, furthermore, who commit those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> whereof the apostle says, <q>They who do such things shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082857"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse21">Galatians&nbsp;5:21</a></span> are by all means to be guarded against, and are to be compelled to seek amendment if they do not choose it voluntarily, because they are marked with the stains of <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>, and go down into the pit, unless assistance is brought them by sacerdotal authority. Those also are to be dealt with in like manner of whom he says, <q>With such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, no, not to eat;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082858"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:11</a></span> because such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are branded with <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> until they are restored by sacerdotal authority, and reinstated in the bosom of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; since those who are outside us cannot communicate with us. And it is manifest that these are outside us, and ought to be separated from us, with whom it is not lawful for us to eat or to take food. In like manner also, all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who underlie the charge of any manner of turpitude and dishonour, are rendered <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a>; and all who arm themselves against fathers are rendered <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a>. <q>Sand, and <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, and a mass of iron, is easier to bear than a man without understanding, and foolish and impious.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082859"><a href="../bible/sir022.htm#verse15">Sirach&nbsp;22:15</a></span> <q>He that wants understanding thinks upon vain things; and a foolish and erring man imagines follies.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082860"><a href="../bible/sir016.htm#verse23">Sirach&nbsp;16:23</a></span> For their suspicion has overthrown many, and their opinion has held them in vanity. <q>A stubborn heart shall fare <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> at the last; and he that loves danger shall perish therein. A heart that enters two ways shall not have rest; and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> heart in them shall be made to stumble. A <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> heart shall be laden with sorrows; and the sinner shall heap <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> upon <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and their successors, having such things in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and foreseeing, as being filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, the course of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, and having regard to the simple, determined that the accusing of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should be a matter undertaken with difficulty, or never undertaken, that they might not be ruined or displaced by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men. For if this were made an easy matter to secular and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, there would remain no one, or but the scantiest few; seeing that it ever has been and still is the case&mdash; and (which is yet worse) that too in growing measure&mdash; that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the good, and that the carnal are hostile to the spiritual. For this reason, then, as has been already said, they decreed that such should not be accused at all; or if that could not be avoided, that the accusing of such should be made a matter of great difficulty. And they determined also, as has been stated above, by what <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that function should not be assumed; and they resolved further, that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should not be cast out from their own proper seats and churches. But if in any way the matter <em>of accusation</em> should be taken in hand before their rightful seat and all their property are restored by those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, they should by no means be accused or criminated by any one, and should not answer any one on such charges, unless they choose to do so of their own accord. But after they have been reinstated, as has been before noted, and have had all their effects restored to them by those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, when their affairs are arranged and set in order, they should then have a long period allowed them for the disposing of their case; and thereafter, if need be, they should be regularly summoned, and so come to the suit; and if the matter seem just, they should answer the propositions of their accusers with the help of their brethren. For so long as their effects, or their churches and property, are held by their adversaries, or by any person, no manner of reason allows that any charge ought to be preferred against them. And no one is at liberty by any means to bring any charge against them, whether superior or inferior, so long as they are dispossessed of their churches, effects, or powers. In like manner also it was decreed, and we too confirm the same statutes and hereby decree, that if any one among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> proves an enemy or traducer of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and seeks to criminate them, or conspires against them, at once, before the consideration of judicial investigation, he should be removed from the clerical order, and given over to the court (<em>curi&aelig;</em>), to which he shall devote himself <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> all the days of his life, and shall remain <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> without any hope of restoration. And let no one ever presume to be at once accuser, and judge, or <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; for in every judicial investigation there must always be four <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> present: that is, the judges elected, and the accusers, and the defenders, and the witnesses. In like manner we decree and ordain by apostolic authority, that the flock should not dare to bring a charge against their pastor, to whose care they had been consigned, unless he falls into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of superiors are not to be smitten with the sword of the mouth; neither can the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> be above the master, as the voice of Truth says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082862"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;10:24</a></span> </p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is hateful before God and men, and all iniquity is execrable. <q>The Lord has destroyed the memory of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and has left the memory of the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> in mind. The seed of men shall be honoured, this <em>seed</em> that fears God. But that seed shall be dishonoured that transgresses the commandments of the Lord. Among brethren, he that is chief is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>; and they that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord shall be in His eyes. My son, says Solomon, preserve your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in meekness, and give <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to him whom <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> beseems.</q>  <q>Blame not any one before you examine him; and when you have examined him, reprove him <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>. Answer not a word before you hear the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; neither interrupt with talk in the midst of your seniors.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082864"><a href="../bible/sir011.htm#verse7">Sirach&nbsp;11:7-8</a></span> After the example of Ham the son of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, they are condemned who bring the faults of their fathers into public view, or presume to accuse or <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> them; even as was the case with Ham, who did not cover the shame of his father <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, but exhibited it for mockery. And in like manner those are justified by the example of <a href="../cathen/13693a.htm">Shem</a> and Japhet, who reverently cover and seek not to display those matters in which they find their fathers to have erred. For if a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should happen to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he should in the first place be corrected privately by those placed under him (<em>a subditis</em> <em>suis</em>). And if he show himself incorrigible (which may God forbid), then an accusation should be laid against him before his primates, or before the seat of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For his other actings, however, he is rather to be borne with by his flock and those put under him, than accused or made the subject of public detraction; because when any offense is committed in these matters by those put under them, His ordinance is withstood who set them before him, as the apostle says, <q>Whosoever resists the power, resists the ordinance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082865"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;13:2</a></span> But he who fears Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, agrees in no way to do anything contrary to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, or contrary to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, or contrary to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> or the institutions of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> therefore are to be honoured, and not to be injured or reproached. Thus read we in Ecclesiasticus: <q>Fear the Lord with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and reverence His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Love Him that made you with all your strength, and forsake not His ministers. Honour God with your whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and cleanse yourself beforehand with the shoulders (<em>propurga te cum brachiis</em>).

<h2>The Third Epistle of Pope Fabian</h2>

<p><strong>To Bishop Hilary. That extraneous judgments should be rejected, and that the accused person should carry out his cause in his own locality; and that every one who brings forward a charge should intimate in writing his ability to prove it, and that if he fails to prove what he alleges, he should bear the penalty which he advanced.</strong></p>

<p>Fabian, to my dearly beloved brother Bishop Hilary.</p>

<p>We ought to be mindful of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God to us, who, in the compassion of His own regard, has raised us for this reason to the summit of sacerdotal dignity, that by cleaving to His commandments, and by being set in a certain eminence as overseers of His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, we may restrain things unlawful, and inculcate things that are to be followed. For we have heard that in those western parts in which you dwell, the craft of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> rages so violently against the people of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and breaks forth in delusions so manifold, that it oppresses and troubles not only the secular <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Lord themselves also. Wherefore, involved as we are in deep grief, we cannot conceal what we ought severely to correct. Accordingly a sufficient remedy must be employed for such wounds, lest a hasty facility in the cure may prove of no service for the deadly disease of the head; and lest the trouble, by being too easily dealt with, may involve, through the defect of an illegitimate mode of cure, the hurt and the healers together in its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<h3>1. Of those who ought not to be admitted to the right of accusation.</h3>

<p>On this account, therefore, we decree and resolve, that those who are not of good conversation, or whose life is impeachable, or whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and life and liberty are unknown, should not have the power of accusing the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Lord, lest vile <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should thus be admitted to the liberty of accusing them. In like manner, those who are involved in any matters of accusation, or who are under suspicion, should not have a voice in laying charges against their seniors; for the voice of the suspected and the inimical is wont to oppress the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h3>Of extraneous judgments.</h3>

<p>Moreover, by a general ordinance, and without prejudice to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> in all things, we prohibit extraneous judgments, because it is not fit that he should be judged by strangers, who ought to have those of his own province and those elected by himself as his judges, unless an appeal has been made. Wherefore, if any one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is accused on precise charges, he ought to be heard by all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are in the province; for it is not right that an accused person should be heard elsewhere than in his own circuit. Again, if any one is of opinion that he has a judge adverse to him, he should claim the right of appeal; and an appellant ought to be injured by no kind of oppression or detention; but an appellant ought to have the liberty of righting his case, when wronged, by the remedy of appeal. There ought also to be liberty of appeal in criminal cases. And the right of appealing ought to be denied to no one whom judgment has destined for punishment.</p>

<h3>3. Of the arraigned.</h3>

<p>A person arraigned ought to plead his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> before his judge; and an arraigned person may refuse to speak, if he choose so, before one who is not his own proper judge; and indulgence (<em>induci&aelig;</em>) should be granted to the arraigned as often as they appeal.</p>

<h3>4. Of the case of any one bringing forward a charge in passion, or failing to prove his allegations.</h3>

<p>If, then, any one in passion brings a charge rashly against any one, mere abuse is not to be taken for an accusation. But a certain time being allowed for dealing with the matter, the person should profess his ability in writing to prove what he has alleged in passion; so that, if he should happen to think better of the things he uttered in passion, and decline to repeat or write them, the person may not be held as charged with the crime. Every one, therefore, who adduces a charge, ought to state in writing his ability to prove it. And, indeed, a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> should always be dealt with in the place where the charge is admitted; and the man who fails to substantiate his allegation, should himself bear the penalty which he advanced.</p>

<h3>5. On the question of an accused bishop appealing to the seat of the apostles.</h3>

<p>It is determined, moreover, that, in the case of an accused <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> appealing to the seat of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that should be held to be a settlement  which is the decision of the pontiff of that same seat. On all occasions, however, in cases concerning <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, let this form be maintained, that no one be bound by a decision pronounced by another than his own proper judge. It is the duty also of all the faithful to be ready to help the oppressed and the miserable in their distress, in order that by the manifestation of another manner of recompense (<em>vindict&aelig;</em>) they may be able to keep the recompense (<em>vengeance</em>) of God from themselves. For he offers (<em>libat</em>) things prosperous to the Lord who keeps off things adverse from the afflicted. Whence it is written, <q>A brother aiding a brother shall be exalted.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082867"><a href="../bible/pro018.htm#verse19">Proverbs&nbsp;18:19</a></span> For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> ought to be without spot or wrinkle, and therefore it ought not to be trodden and defiled by certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; for it is written, <q>My dove, my undefiled, is but one.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082868"><a href="../bible/son006.htm#verse9">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;6:9</a></span> Hence, again, the Lord says to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>There is a place with me (<em>penes me</em>), and you shall stand upon a rock.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082869"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse21">Exodus&nbsp;33:21</a></span> What place is there that belongs not to the Lord, seeing that all things consist in Him by whom they were created? There is a place, however, with God&mdash; to wit, the unity of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church&mdash; in which there is a standing upon a rock, while the perfection of the confession (<em>confessionis soliditas</em>) is held in lowliness. We admonish you, our brother, and all our brethren who are rulers in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which He has purchased with His blood, to keep back, by whatever checks ye possess, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from that abyss into which some brethren are slipping, in reviling the Lord's pastors, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> them both by word and deed; and we counsel you not to suffer them to be wounded with the hook of passion: for it is written, <q>For the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of man works not the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082870"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse20">James&nbsp;1:20</a></span> Hence it is said again, <q>Let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082871"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse19">James&nbsp;1:19</a></span> Now I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not that with God's help you observe all these things; but as an occasion for counsel has arisen, I also secretly attach my word to your good desires and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, so that what you are doing of yourselves and independently of admonition you may do presently not by yourselves alone, now that the counsellor himself is added to you. Wherefore, brethren, it becomes you and all the faithful to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> each other, and not to <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> or accuse one another: for it is written, <q>Love your neighbour, and be faithful unto him. But if you betray his secrets, you shall follow no more after him. For as a man who destroys his friend, so is he that loses the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of his neighbour. And as one that lets a bird go out of his hand, so are you who has let your neighbour go, and shall not get him again. Follow after him no more, for he is far off. For he is as a roe escaped out of the snare, since his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is wounded. Further you will not be able to bind him up, and after reviling there may be reconcilement; but to bewray the secrets of a friend is the despair of an unhappy mind. He that winks with the eye works <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and every one will cast him off. When you are present, he will speak sweetly, and will admire your words. But at last he will writhe his mouth, and <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> your sayings. I have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> many things, but nothing like him; and the Lord will <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> him. Whoso casts a stone on high, it will fall upon his own head; and a deceitful stroke shall make wounds in the deceiver. Whoso digs a pit shall fall therein; and he that places a stone in his neighbour's way shall stumble thereon; and he that sets a trap for another shall perish in it. He that works mischief, it shall fall upon him; and he shall not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whence it comes on him. Mockery and reproach are from the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>; and vengeance, as a lion, shall lie in wait for them. They that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at the fall of the righteous shall be taken in the snare; and anguish shall consume them before they die. Wrath and fury are both abominations, and the sinful man shall have them both.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082872"><a href="../bible/sir027.htm#verse17">Sirach&nbsp;27:17-30</a></span> <q>He that desires to be avenged shall find vengeance from the Lord, and He will surely keep his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> <em>in remembrance</em>. Forgive your neighbour the hurt that he has done you; so shall your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> also be forgiven you when you pray. One man bears <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against another, and does he seek pardon from the Lord? He shows no mercy to a man which is like himself, and does he ask forgiveness of his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from the Most High? He, though he is but flesh, nourishes <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; and does he implore mercy from God? Who will entreat for pardon of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? Remember your end, and let enmity cease. For corruption and death impend on His commandments. Remember the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and bear no <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> to your neighbour. Remember the covenant of the Highest, and wink at the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of your neighbour. Abstain from strife, and you shall diminish your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For a <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> man will kindle strife, and a sinful man will disquiet friends, and will make debate among them that be at peace. For according to the trees of the wood, so will the fire burn; and according as a man's strength is, so will his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> be; and according to his riches, his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> will rise. An hasty contention will kindle a fire; and an hasty fighting will shed blood; and a tale-bearing (<em>testificans</em>) tongue will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> death. If you blow the spark, it shall burn like a fire; and if you spit upon it, it shall be quenched; and both these come out of your mouth. The whisperer and double-tongued  is cursed; for he has destroyed many that were at peace. A backbiting (<em>tertia</em>) tongue has disquieted many, and driven them from nation to nation. Strong cities of the rich has it pulled down, and overthrown the houses of great men. It has destroyed the strength of peoples, and has scattered strong nations. A backbiting tongue has cast out <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (<em>viratas</em>, spirited), and deprived them of their labours. Whoso hearkens unto it shall never find rest, and shall never have a friend on whom he may repose. The stroke of the whip makes marks; but the stroke of the tongue will break the bones. Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not so many as have fallen by the tongue. Well is he that is defended from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tongue, and has not passed through the venom thereof; who has not drawn the yoke thereof, nor has been bound in her bands. For the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the bands thereof are bands of brass. The death thereof is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> death, and the grave were better than it. Its endurance shall not abide, but it shall possess the ways of the unrighteous. In its flame it shall not burn the righteous. Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it; and it shall burn in them, and not be quenched; and it shall be sent upon them as a lion, and devour them as a leopard. Hedge your ears (<em>s&aelig;pi aures</em>) about with thorns, and refuse to listen to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tongue, and make a door for your mouth and bars for your ears. Smelt (<em>confla</em>) your gold and your silver, and make a balance for your words, and a right bridle for your mouth. And beware lest you slide perchance in your tongue, and fall in the sight of your enemies that be in wait for you, and your fall be irremediable unto death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note082873"><a href="../bible/sir028.htm">Sirach&nbsp;xxviii</a></span> Let all beware of these things, and <q>keep your tongue from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and your lips from speaking guile.</q>  <q>Finally, dearly beloved, be strong in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and in the power of His might. Put on the armour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in heavenly places (<em>c&oelig;lestibus</em>). Wherefore take unto you the armour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may be able to withstand in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> day, and to stand perfect in all (<em>omnibus perfecti</em>).

<h2>The Decrees of Pope Fabian</h2>

<p><strong>Taken from the Decretal of Gratian.</strong></p>

<h3>1. That the man who refuses to be reconciled to his brother should be reduced by the severest fastings.</h3> 

<p>If any injured person refuses to be reconciled to his brother, when he who has injured him offers satisfaction, he should be reduced by the severest <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, even until he accepts the satisfaction offered him with thankful mind.</p>

<h3>2. The man is rendered infamous who knowingly presumes to forswear himself.</h3> 

<p>Whosoever has knowingly forsworn himself, should be put for forty days on bread and water, and do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> also for the seven following years; and he should never be without penance; and he should never be admitted to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. After this, however, he may enjoy communion.</p>

<h3>3. A man and a woman subject to madness cannot enter into marriage.</h3> 

<p>Neither can a mad man nor a mad <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> enter into the marriage relation. But if it has been entered, then they shall not be separated.</p>

<h3>4. Marriage relations in the fifth generation may unite with each other; and in the fourth generation, if they are found, they should not be separated.</h3> 

<p>Concerning relations who enter affinity by the connection of husband and wife, these, on the decease of wife or husband, may form a union in the fifth generation; and in the fourth, if they are found, they should not be separated. In the third degree of relationship, however, it is not lawful for one to take the wife of another on his death. In an equable manner, a man may be united in marriage after his wife's death with those who are his own kinswomen, and with the kinswomen of his wife.</p>

<p> <em>To the immediately preceding notice.</em> </p>

<p>Those who marry a wife allied by blood, and are separated, shall not be at liberty, as long as both parties are alive, to unite other wives with them in marriage, unless they can plead the excuse of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.</p>

<h3>5. Blood connections alone, or, if offspring entirely fails, the old and trustworthy, should reckon the matter of propinquity in the synod.</h3> 

<p>No alien should accuse blood connections, or reckon the matter of consanguinity in the synod, but relations to whose <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> it pertains&mdash;that is, father and mother, sister and brother, paternal uncle, maternal uncle, paternal aunt, maternal aunt, and their children. If, however, offspring entirely fails, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall make inquiry canonically of the older and more trustworthy <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom the same relationship may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; and if such relationship is found, the parties should be separated.</p>

<h3>6. Every one of the faithful should communicate three times a year.</h3> 

<p>Although they may not do it more frequently, yet at least three times in the year should the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> communicate, unless one happen to be hindered by any more serious offenses,&mdash; to wit, at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and Pentecost, and the Lord's Nativity.</p>

<h3>7. A presbyter should not be ordained younger than thirty years of age.</h3> 

<p>If one has not completed thirty years of age, he should in no way be ordained as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, even although he may be extremely worthy; for even the Lord Himself was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> only when He was thirty years of age, and at that period He began to teach. It is not right, therefore, that one who is to be ordained should be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> until he has reached this legitimate age.</p>

<h2>The Decrees of Pope Fabian</h2>

<p><strong>The Decrees of the Same, from the Codex of Decrees in Sixteen Books, from the Fifth Book, and the Seventh and Ninth Chapters</strong></p>

<h3>1. That the oblation of the altar should be made each Lord's day.</h3>

<p>We decree that on each Lord's day the oblation of the altar should be made by men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in bread and wine, in order that by means of these <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> they may be released from the burden of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<h3>2. That an illiterate presbyter may not venture to celebrate mass.</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is not to be accepted from the hand of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who is not competent to discharge the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> or actions (<em>actiones</em>) and other observances in the mass according to religious usage.</p>
