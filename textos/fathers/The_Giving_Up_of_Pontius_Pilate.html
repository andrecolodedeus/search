<h1>The Giving Up of Pontius Pilate</h1>

<p>And the writings having come to the city of the Romans, and having been read to the C&aelig;sar, with not a few standing by, all were astounded, because through the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> the darkness and the earthquake had come over the whole world. And the C&aelig;sar, filled with rage, sent soldiers, and ordered them to bring <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> a prisoner.</p>

<p>And when he was brought to the city of the Romans, the C&aelig;sar, hearing that <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> had arrived, sat in the temple of the gods, in the presence of all the senate, and with all the army, and all the multitude of his power; and he ordered <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> to stand forward.  And the C&aelig;sar says to him: Why have you, O most impious, dared to do such things, having seen so great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in that man? By daring to do an <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deed</a>, you have destroyed the whole world.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said: O almighty  king, I am innocent of these things; but the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are violent and guilty. And the C&aelig;sar said: And who are they? <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, Archelaus, Philip, <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, and all the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The C&aelig;sar says: For what reason did you follow out their counsel? And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: Their nation is rebellious and insubmissive, not submitting themselves to your power. And the C&aelig;sar said: When they delivered him to you, you ought to have made him secure, and to have sent him to me, and not to have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> them in crucifying such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, righteous as he was, and one that did such good <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, as you have said in your report. For from such <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> Jesus was manifestly the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</p>

<p>And as the C&aelig;sar was thus speaking, when he named the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, all the multitude of the gods fell down in a body, and became as dust, where the C&aelig;sar was sitting with the senate. And the people standing beside the C&aelig;sar all began to tremble, on account of the speaking of the word, and the fall of their gods; and being seized with terror, they all went away, each to his own house, wondering at what had happened. And the C&aelig;sar ordered <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> to be kept in security, in order that he might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about Jesus.</p>

<p>And on the following day, the C&aelig;sar, sitting in the Capitol with all the senate, tried again to question <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>. And the C&aelig;sar says: Tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, O most impious, because through your impious action which you have perpetrated against Jesus, even here the doing of your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> has been shown by the gods having been cast down. Say, then, who is he that has been crucified; because even his name has destroyed all the gods? <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said: And indeed the records of him are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; for assuredly I myself was persuaded from his works that he was greater than all the gods whom we worship. And the C&aelig;sar said: For what reason, then, did you bring against him such audacity and such doings, if you were not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of him, and altogether devising mischief against my kingdom? <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said: On account of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and rebellion of the lawless and ungodly <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, I did this.</p>

<p>And the C&aelig;sar, being filled with rage, held a council with all his senate and his power, and ordered a decree to be written against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as follows:&mdash; To Licianus, the governor of the chief places of the East, greeting. The reckless deed which has been done at the present time by the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the cities of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> round about, and their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> action, has come to my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that they have forced <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> to crucify a certain god named Jesus, and on account of this great fault of theirs the world has been darkened and dragged to destruction. Go to them speedily, with a multitude of soldiers, and make them prisoners, in accordance with this decree. Be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>, and take action against them, and scatter them, and make them slaves among all the nations; and having driven them out of the whole of Jud&aelig;a, make them the smallest of nations, so that it may not any longer be seen at all, because they are full of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. </p>

<p>And this decree having come into the region of the East, Licianus, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the decree, seized all the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and those that were left in Jud&aelig;a he scattered among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and sold for slaves:  so that it was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the C&aelig;sar that these things had been done by Licianus against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the region of the East; and it pleased him.</p>

<p>And again the C&aelig;sar set himself to question <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>; and he orders a captain named Albius to cut off <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> head, saying: Just as he laid hands upon the just man named Christ, in like manner also shall he fall, and not find safety.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, going away to the place, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in silence, saying: Lord, do not destroy me along with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> Hebrews, because I would not have laid hands upon You, except for the nation of the lawless <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, because they were exciting rebellion against me. But You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I did it in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Do not then destroy me for this my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but remember not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against me, O Lord, and against Your servant Procla, who is standing with me in this the hour of my death, whom You appointed to prophesy that You should be nailed to the cross. Do not condemn her also in my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but pardon us, and make us to be numbered in the portion of Your righteous.</p>

<p>And, behold, when <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> had finished his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, there came a voice out of the heaven, saying: All the generations and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the nations shall count you blessed, because under you have been fulfilled all those things said about me by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and you yourself shall be seen as my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> at my second appearing, when I shall judge the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and those that have not owned my name. And the prefect struck off the head of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>; and, behold, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord received it. And his wife Procla, seeing the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> coming and receiving his head, being filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> herself also, immediately gave up the ghost, and was buried along with her husband. </p>
