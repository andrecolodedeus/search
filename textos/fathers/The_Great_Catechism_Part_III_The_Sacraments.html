<h1>The Great Catechism (Part III, The Sacraments)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 33</h2>

<p>For when they have heard from us something to this effect&mdash; that when the mortal passes into life it follows necessarily that, as that first birth leads only to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of mortality, another birth should be discovered, a birth which neither begins nor ends with corruption, but one which conducts the person begotten to an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, in order that, as what is begotten of a mortal birth has necessarily a mortal subsistence, so from a birth which admits not corruption that which is born may be superior to the corruption of death; when, I say, they have heard this and the like from us, and are besides instructed as to the process&mdash;namely that it is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the invocation of heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and water, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of regeneration is accomplished&mdash;they still remain incredulous and have an eye only for the outward and visible, as if that which is operated corporeally  concurred not with the fulfilment of God's promise. How, they ask, can <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the invocation of Divine power over the water be the foundation of life in those who have been thus initiated? In reply to them, unless they be of a very obstinate disposition, one single consideration suffices to bring them to an acquiescence in our doctrine. For let us in our turn ask them about that process of the carnal generation which every one can notice. How does that something which is cast for the beginnings of the formation of a living being become a Man? In that case, most certainly, there is no method whatever that can discover for us, by any possible reasoning, even the probable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For what correlation is there between the definition of man and the quality observable in that something? Man, when once he is put together, is a reasoning and intellectual being, capable of thought and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; but that something is to be observed only in its quality of humidity, and the mind grasps nothing in it beyond that which is seen by the sense of sight. The reply, therefore, which we might expect to receive from those whom we questioned as to how it is credible that a man is compounded from that humid element, is the very reply which we make when questioned about the regeneration that takes place through the water. Now in that other case any one so questioned has this reply ready at hand, that that element becomes a man by a Divine power, wanting which, the element is motionless and inoperative. If, therefore, in that instance the subordinate matter does not make the man, but the Divine power changes that visible thing into a man's nature, it would be utterly unfair for them, when in the one case they testify to such power in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in this other department to suppose that the Deity is too weak to accomplish His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. What is there common, they ask, between water and life? What is there common, we ask them in return, between humidity and God's image? In that case there is no paradox if, God so willing, what is humid changes into the most rare creature.  Equally, then, in this case we assert that there is nothing strange when the presence of a Divine influence transforms what is born with a corruptible nature into a state of incorruption.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34</h2>

<p>But they ask for <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this presence of the Deity when invoked for the sanctification of the baptismal process.  Let the person who requires this evidence recall to mind the result of our inquiries further back. The reasoning by which we established that the power which was manifested to us through the flesh was really a Divine power, is the defence of that which we now say. For when it has been shown that He Who was manifested in the flesh, and then exhibited His nature by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which He wrought, was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is also at the same time shown that He is present in that process, as often as He is invoked. For, as of everything that exists there is some peculiarity which indicates its nature, so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the distinctive peculiarity of the Divine nature. Well, then, He has promised that He will always be present with those that call upon Him, that He is in the midst of those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that He remains among them collectively and has special intercourse with each one. We can no longer, then, need any other <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the presence of the Deity in the things that are done in Baptism, believing as we do that He is God by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which He wrought, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> as we do that it is the peculiarity of the Godhead to be free from any touch of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, and confidently holding as we do that the thing promised was involved in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfulness</a> of its announcement. The invocation by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, then, which precedes this Divine Dispensation constitutes an abundance of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that what is effected is done by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if in the case of that other kind of man-formation the impulses of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, even though they do not invoke the Deity, yet by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as we have before said, mould the embryo, and if this power is withheld their eagerness is ineffectual and useless, how much more will the object be accomplished in that spiritual mode of generation, where both God has promised that He will be present in the process and, as we have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, has put power from Himself into the work, and, besides, our own will is bent upon that object; supposing, that is, that the aid which comes through <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> has at the same time been duly called in? For as they who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> God that the sun may shine on them in no way blunt the promptitude of that which is actually going to take place, yet no one will say that the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of those who thus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> is useless on the ground that they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> God for what must happen, in the same way they who, resting on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfulness</a> of His promise, are firmly persuaded that His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is surely present in those who are regenerate in this mystical Dispensation, either themselves make  an actual addition to that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, or at all events do not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the existing <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to miscarry. For that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is there is a matter of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, on account of Him Who has promised to give it being Divine; while the testimony as to His Divinity comes through the Miracles.  Thus, then, that the Deity is present in all the baptismal process  admits of no question.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35</h2>

<p>But the descent into the water, and the trine immersion of the person in it, involves another <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. For since the method of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was made effectual not so much by His precepts in the way of teaching  as by the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of Him Who has realized an actual fellowship with man, and has effected life as a living fact, so that by means of the flesh which He has assumed, and at the same time deified , everything kindred and related may be saved along with it, it was necessary that some means should be devised by which there might be, in the baptismal process, a kind of affinity and likeness between him who follows and Him Who leads the way. Needful, therefore, is it to see what features are to be observed in the Author of our life, in order that the imitation on the part of those that follow may be regulated, as the Apostle says, after the pattern of the Captain of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.  For, as it is they who are actually drilled into measured and orderly movements in arms by skilled drill-masters, who are advanced to dexterity in handling their weapons by what they see with their eyes, whereas he who does not practise what is shown him remains devoid of such dexterity, in the same way it is imperative on all those who have an equally earnest desire for the Good as He has, to be followers by the path of an exact imitation of Him Who leads the way to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and to carry into action what He has shown them. It is, in fact, impossible for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to reach the same goal unless they travel by the same ways. For as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are at a loss how to thread the turns of mazes, when they happen to fall in with some one who has experience of them, get to the end of those various misleading turnings in the chambers by following him behind, which they could not do, did they not follow him their leader step by step, so too, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you mark, the labyrinth of this our life cannot be threaded by the faculties of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> unless a man pursues that same path as He did Who, though once in it, yet got beyond the difficulties which hemmed Him in. I apply this figure of a labyrinth to that <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of death, which is without an egress  and environs the wretched race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. What, then, have we beheld in the case of the Captain of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? A three days' state of death and then life again. Now some sort of resemblance in us to such things has to be planned. What, then, is the plan by which in us too a resemblance to that which took place in Him is completed? Everything that is affected by death has its proper and natural place, and that is the earth in which it is laid and hidden. Now earth and water have much mutual affinity. Alone of the elements they have weight and gravitate downwards; they mutually abide in each other; they are mutually confined. Seeing, then, the death of the Author of our life subjected Him to burial in earth and was in accord with our common nature, the imitation which we enact of that death is expressed in the neighbouring element. And as He, that Man from above , having taken deadness on Himself, after His being deposited in the earth, returned back to life the third day, so every one who is knitted to Him by virtue of his bodily form, looking forward to the same successful issue, I mean this arriving at life by having, instead of earth, water poured on him , and so submitting to that element, has represented for him in the three movements the three-days-delayed <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the resurrection. Something like this has been said in what has gone before, namely, that by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> death has been introduced as a dispensation into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so that, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> having flowed away at the dissolution of the union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, man, through the resurrection, might be refashioned, sound, passionless, stainless, and removed from any touch of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In the case however of the Author of our Salvation this dispensation of death reached its fulfilment, having entirely accomplished its special purpose. For in His death, not only were things that once were one put asunder, but also things that had been disunited were again brought together; so that in this dissolution of things that had naturally grown together, I mean, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, our nature might be purified, and this return to union of these severed elements might secure freedom from the contamination of any foreign admixture. But as regards those who follow this Leader, their nature does not admit of an exact and entire imitation, but it receives now as much as it is capable of receiving, while it reserves the remainder for the time that comes after. In what, then, does this imitation consist? It consists in the effecting the suppression of that admixture of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in the figure of mortification that is given by the water, not certainly a complete effacement, but a kind of break in the continuity of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, two things concurring to this removal of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash; the penitence of the transgressor and his imitation of the death. By these two things the man is in a measure freed from his congenital tendency to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; by his penitence he advances to a <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of and averseness from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and by his death he works out the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But had it been possible for him in his imitation to undergo a complete dying, the result would be not imitation but identity; and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of our nature would so entirely vanish that, as the Apostle says, <q>he would die unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> once for all. </q> But since, as has been said, we only so far imitate the transcendent Power as the poverty of our nature is capable of, by having the water thrice poured on us and ascending again up from the water, we enact that saving burial and resurrection which took place on the third day, with this thought in our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that as we have power over the water both to be in it and arise out of it, so He too, Who has the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> at His sovereign disposal, immersed Himself in death, as we in the water, to return  to His own blessedness. If, therefore, one looks to that which is in reason, and judges of the results according to the power inherent in either party, one will discover no disproportion in these results, each in proportion to the measure of his natural power working out the effects that are within his reach. For, as it is in the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if he is so disposed, to touch the water and yet be safe, with infinitely greater ease may death be handled by the Divine Power so as to be in it and yet not to be changed by it injuriously. Observe, then, that it is necessary for us to rehearse beforehand in the water the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the resurrection, to the intent that we may understand that, as far as facility goes, it is the same thing for us to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water and to rise again from death. But as in matters that concern our life here, there are some which take precedence of others, as being those without which the result could not be achieved, although if the beginning be compared with the end, the beginning so contrasted will seem of no account (for what equality, for instance, is there between the man and that which is laid as a foundation for the constitution of his animal being? And yet if that had never been, neither would this be which we see), in like manner that which happens in the great resurrection, essentially vaster though it be, has its beginnings and its causes here; it is not, in fact, possible that that should take place, unless this had gone before; I mean, that without the laver of regeneration it is impossible for the man to be in the resurrection; but in saying this I do not regard the mere remoulding and refashioning of our composite body; for towards this it is absolutely necessary that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> should advance, being constrained thereto by its own <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> according to the dispensation of Him Who has so ordained, whether it have received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the laver, or whether it remains without that initiation: but I am thinking of the restoration to a blessed and divine condition, separated from all shame and sorrow. For not everything that is granted in the resurrection a return to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> will return to the same kind of life. There is a wide interval between those who have been purified, and those who still need purification. For those in whose life-time here the purification by the laver has preceded, there is a restoration to a kindred state. Now, to the pure, freedom from passion is that kindred state, and that in this freedom from passion blessedness consists, admits of no dispute. But as for those whose weaknesses have become inveterate , and to whom no purgation of their defilement has been applied, no mystic water, no invocation of the Divine power, no amendment by repentance, it is absolutely necessary that they should come to be in something proper to their case&mdash;just as the furnace is the proper thing for gold alloyed with dross&mdash;in order that, the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> which has been mixed up in them being melted away after long succeeding ages, their nature may be restored pure again to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Since, then, there is a cleansing <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in fire and water, they who by the mystic water have washed away the defilement of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> have no further need of the other form of purification, while they who have not been admitted to that form of purgation must needs be purified by fire.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36</h2>

<p>For common sense as well as the teaching of Scripture shows that it is impossible for one who has not thoroughly cleansed himself from all the stains arising from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be admitted among the heavenly company. This is a thing which, though little in itself, is the beginning and foundation of great blessings. I call it little on account of the facility of the means of amendment. For what difficulty is there in this matter? Viz. to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God is everywhere, and that being in all things He is also present with those who call upon Him for His life-supporting power, and that, thus present, He does that which properly belongs to Him to do. Now, the work properly belonging to the Divine energy is the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those who need it; and this <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> proves effectual  by means of the cleansing in the water; and he that has been so cleansed will participate in Purity; and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Purity is Deity. You see, then, how small a thing it is in its beginning, and how easily effected; I mean, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and water; the first residing within the will, the latter being the nursery companion of the life of man. But as to the blessing which springs from these two things, oh! How great and how wonderful it is, that it should imply relationship with Deity itself!</p>

<h2>Chapter 37</h2>

<p>But since the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being is a twofold creature, compounded of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, it is necessary that the saved should lay hold of  the Author of the new life through both their component parts. Accordingly, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being fused into Him through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> derives from that the means and occasion of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; for the act of union with the life implies a fellowship with the life. But the body comes into fellowship and blending with the Author of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in another way. For as they who owing to some act of treachery have taken poison, allay its deadly influence by means of some other drug (for it is necessary that the antidote should enter the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> vitals in the same way as the deadly poison, in order to secure, through them, that the effect of the remedy may be distributed through the entire system), in like manner we, who have tasted the solvent of our nature , necessarily need something that may combine what has been so dissolved, so that such an antidote entering within us may, by its own counter-influence, undo the mischief introduced into the body by the poison. What, then, is this remedy to be? Nothing else than that very Body which has been shown to be superior to death, and has been the First-fruits of our life. For, in the manner that, as the Apostle says <span class="stiki" id="note292037"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:6</a></span>, a little leaven assimilates to itself the whole lump, so in like manner that body to which <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> has been given it by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when it is in ours, translates and transmutes the whole into itself. For as by the admixture of a poisonous liquid with a wholesome one the whole drought is deprived of its deadly effect, so too the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> Body, by being within that which receives it, changes the whole to its own nature. Yet in no other way can anything enter within the body but by being transfused through the vitals by eating and drinking. It is, therefore, incumbent on the body to admit this life-producing power in the one way that its constitution makes possible. And since that Body only which was the receptacle of the Deity received this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and since it has been shown that in no other way was it possible for our body to become <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, but by participating in incorruption through its fellowship with that <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> Body, it will be necessary to consider how it was possible that that one Body, being for ever portioned to so many myriads of the faithful throughout the whole world, enters through that portion, whole into each individual, and yet remains whole in itself. In order, therefore, that our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, with eyes fixed on <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> probability, may harbour no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on the subject before us, it is fitting to make a slight digression in our argument, to consider the physiology of the body. Who is there that does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that our bodily frame, taken by itself, possesses no life in its own proper subsistence, but that it is by the influx of a force or power from without that it holds itself together and continues in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and by a ceaseless motion that it draws to itself what it wants, and repels what is superfluous? When a leathern bottle is full of some liquid, and then the contents leak out at the bottom, it would not retain the contour of its full bulk unless there entered in at the top something else to fill up the vacuum; and thus a person, seeing the circumference of this bottle swollen to its full size, would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this circumference did not really belong to the object which he sees, but that what was being poured in, by being in it, gave shape and roundness to the bulk. In the same way the mere framework of our body possesses nothing belonging to itself that is cognizable by us, to hold it together, but remains in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> owing to a force that is introduced into it. Now this power or force both is, and is called, nourishment. But it is not the same in all bodies that require aliment, but to each of them has been assigned a food adapted to its condition by Him who governs Nature. Some animals feed on roots which they dig up. Of others grass is the food, of others different kinds of flesh, but for man above all things bread; and, in order to continue and preserve the moisture of his body, drink, not simply water, but water frequently sweetened with wine, to join forces with our internal heat. He, therefore, who thinks of these things, thinks by implication  of the particular bulk of our body. For those things by being within me became my blood and flesh, the corresponding nutriment by its power of adaptation being changed into the form of my body. With these distinctions we must return to the consideration of the question before us. The question was, how can that one Body of Christ vivify the whole of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, all, that is, in whomsoever there is Faith, and yet, though divided among all, be itself not diminished? Perhaps, then, we are now not far from the probable explanation. If the subsistence of every body depends on nourishment, and this is eating and drinking, and in the case of our eating there is bread and in the case of our drinking water sweetened with wine, and if, as was explained at the beginning, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, Who is both God and the Word, coalesced with man's nature, and when He came in a body such as ours did not innovate on man's physical constitution so as to make it other than it was, but secured continuance for His own body by the customary and proper means, and controlled its subsistence by meat and drink, the former of which was bread&mdash;just, then, as in the case of ourselves, as has been repeatedly said already, if a person sees bread he also, in a kind of way, looks on a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, for by the bread being within it the bread becomes it, so also, in that other case, the body into which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> entered, by partaking of the nourishment of bread, was, in a certain measure, the same with it; that nourishment, as we have said, changing itself into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body. For that which is peculiar to all flesh is acknowledged also in the case of that flesh, namely, that that Body too was maintained by bread; which Body also by the indwelling of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was transmuted to the dignity of Godhead. Rightly, then, do we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that now also the bread which is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is changed into the Body of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>. For that Body was once, by implication, bread, but has been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the inhabitation of the Word that tabernacled in the flesh. Therefore, from the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as that by which the bread that was transformed in that Body was changed to a Divine potency, a similar result takes place now. For as in that case, too, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Word used to make <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> the Body, the substance of which came of the bread, and in a manner was itself bread, so also in this case the bread, as says the Apostle <span class="stiki" id="note292039"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:5</a></span>, <q>is sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a></q>; not that it advances by the process of eating  to the stage of passing into the body of the Word, but it is at once changed into the body by means of the Word, as the Word itself said, <q>This is My Body.</q> Seeing, too, that all flesh is nourished by what is moist (for without this combination our earthly part would not continue to live), just as we support by food which is firm and solid the solid part of our body, in like manner we supplement the moist part from the kindred element; and this, when within us, by its faculty of being transmitted, is changed to blood, and especially if through the wine it receives the faculty of being transmuted into heat. Since, then, that God-containing flesh partook for its substance and support of this particular nourishment also, and since the God who was manifested infused Himself into perishable humanity for this purpose, viz. that by this communion with Deity <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> might at the same time be deified, for this end it is that, by dispensation of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, He disseminates Himself in every believer through that flesh, whose substance comes from bread and wine, blending Himself with the bodies of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, to secure that, by this union with the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, man, too, may be a sharer in incorruption. He gives these gifts by virtue of the benediction through which He transelements  the natural quality of these visible things to that <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> thing.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38</h2>

<p>There is now, I think, wanting in these remarks no answer to inquiries concerning the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, except that on Faith ; which we give briefly in the present treatise. For those who require a more elaborate account we have already published it in other works of ours, in which we have explained the subject with all the earnestness and accuracy in our power. In those treatises we have both fought  controversially with our opponents, and also have taken private consultation with ourselves as to the questions which have been brought against us. But in the present discussion we have thought it as well only to say just so much on the subject of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as is involved in the language of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, namely, that one who is begotten by the spiritual regeneration may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who it is that begets him, and what sort of creature he becomes. For it is only this form of generation which has in it the power to become what it chooses to be.</p>

<h2>Chapter 39</h2>

<p>For, while all things else that are born are subject to the impulse of those that beget them, the spiritual birth is dependent on the power of him who is being born. Seeing, then, that here lies the hazard, namely, that he should not miss what is for his advantage, when to every one a free choice is thus open, it were well, I think, for him who is moved towards the begetting of himself, to determine by previous reasoning what kind of father is for his advantage, and of what element it is better for him that his nature should consist. For, as we have said, it is in the power of such a child as this to choose its <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. Since, then, there is a twofold division of existences, into created and uncreated, and since the uncreated world possesses within itself immutability and immobility, while the created is liable to change and alteration, of which will he, who with calculation and deliberation is to choose what is for his benefit, prefer to be the offspring; of that which is always found in a state of change, or of that which possesses a nature that is changeless, steadfast, and ever consistent and unvarying in goodness? Now there have been delivered to us in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> three Persons and names through whom the generation or birth of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> takes place, and he who is begotten by this Trinity is equally begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>&mdash; for thus does the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> speak of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, that <q>that which is born of Spirit is spirit ,</q> and it is <q>in Christ <span class="stiki" id="note292045"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:15</a></span> </q> that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> begets, and the Father is the <q>Father of all;</q> here, then, I beg, let the mind of the hearer be sober in its choice, lest it make itself the offspring of some inconstant nature, when it has it in its power to make the steadfast and unalterable nature the founder of its life. For according to the disposition of heart in one who comes to the Dispensation will that which is begotten in him exhibit its power; so that he who confesses that the Holy Trinity is uncreate enters on the steadfast unalterable life; while another, who through a mistaken conception sees only a created nature in the Trinity and then is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <em>that</em>, has again been born into the shifting and alterable life. For that which is born is of necessity of one kindred with that which begets. Which, then, offers the greater advantage; to enter on the unchangeable life, or to be again tossed about by the waves of this lifetime of uncertainty and change? Well, since it is evident to any one of the least understanding that what is stable is far more valuable than what is unstable, what is perfect than what is deficient, what needs not than what needs, and what has no further to advance, but ever abides in the perfection of all that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, than what climbs by progressive toil, it is incumbent upon every one, at least upon every one who is possessed of sense, to make an absolute choice of one or other of these two conditions, either to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Holy Trinity belongs to the uncreated world, and so through the spiritual birth to make It the foundation of his own life, or, if he thinks that the Son or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is external to the being of the first, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the good, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I mean, of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, not to include these Persons in the belief which he takes upon him at the moment of his new birth, lest he unconsciously make himself over to that imperfect nature  which itself needs some one to make it good, and in a manner bring himself back again to something of the same nature as his own by thus removing his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>  from that higher world. For whoever has bound himself to any created thing forgets that, as from the Deity, he has no longer hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For all creation, owing to the whole equally proceeding from non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> into being, has an intimate connection with itself; and as in the bodily organization all the limbs have a natural and mutual coherence, though some have a downward, some an upward direction, so the world of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things is, viewed as the creation, in oneness with itself, and the differences in us, as regards abundance or deficiency, in no wise disjoint it from this natural coherence with itself. For in things which equally imply the idea of a previous non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, though there be a difference between them in other respects, as regards this point we discover no variation of nature. If, then, man, who is himself a created being, thinks that the Spirit and the Only-begotten God  are likewise created, the hope which he entertains of a change to a better state will be a vain one; for he only returns to himself.  What happens then is on a par with the surmises of <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>; he, when instructed by our Lord as to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of being born from above, because he could not yet comprehend the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, had his thoughts drawn back to his mother's womb.  So that if a man does not conduct himself towards the uncreated nature, but to that which is kindred to, and equally in bondage with, himself, he is of the birth which is from below, and not of that which is from above. But the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> tells us that the birth of the saved is from above.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40</h2>

<p>But, as far as what has been already said, the instruction of this Catechism does not seem to me to be yet complete. For we ought, in my opinion, to take into consideration the sequel of this matter; which many of those who come to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>  overlook, being led astray, and self-deceived, and indeed only seemingly, and not really, regenerate. For that change in our life which takes place through regeneration will not be change, if we continue in the state in which we were. I do not see how it is possible to deem one who is still in the same condition, and in whom there has been no change in the distinguishing features of his nature, to be any other than he was, it being palpable to every one that it is for a renovation and change of our nature that the saving birth is received. And yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> does not of itself admit of any change in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; neither the reason, nor the understanding, nor the scientific faculty, nor any other peculiar characteristic of man is a subject for change. Indeed the change would be for the worse if any one of these properties of our nature were exchanged away  for something else. If, then, the birth from above is a definite refashioning of the man, and yet these properties do not admit of change, it is a subject for inquiry what that is in him, by the changing of which the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of regeneration is perfected. It is evident that when those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> features which mark our nature have been obliterated a change to a better state takes place. If, then, by being <q>washed,</q> as says the Prophet <span class="stiki" id="note292053"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse16">Isaiah&nbsp;1:16</a></span>, in that mystic bath we become <q>clean</q> in our wills and <q>put away the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></q> of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, we thus become better men, and are changed to a better state. But if, when the bath has been applied to the body, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has not cleansed itself from the stains of its <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and affections, but the life after initiation keeps on a level with the uninitiate life, then, though it may be a bold thing to say, yet I will say it and will not shrink; in these cases the water is but water, for the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in no ways appears in him who is thus baptismally born; whenever, that is, not only the deformity of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> , or the passion of greed, or the unbridled and unseemly thought, with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and arrogance, disfigures the Divine image, but the gains, too, of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> abide with him, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> he has procured by <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> still even after that ministers to his pleasures. If these and the like <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, after, as before, surround the life of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, I cannot see in what respects he has been changed; for I observe him the same man as he was before. The man whom he has <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> treated, the man whom he has <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accused, the man whom he has forcibly deprived of his property, these, as far as they are concerned, see no change in him though he has been washed in the laver of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. They do not hear the cry of Zacch&aelig;us from him as well: <q>If I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore fourfold. </q> What they said of him before his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the same they now more fully declare; they call him by the same names, a <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> person, one who is greedy of what belongs to others, one who lives in luxury at the cost of men's calamities. Let such an one, therefore, who remains in the same moral condition as before, and then babbles to himself of the beneficial change he has received from <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, listen to what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says: <q>If a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself <span class="stiki" id="note292056"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse3">Galatians&nbsp;6:3</a></span> .</q> For what you have not become, that you are not. <q>As many as received Him,</q> thus speaks the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of those who have been born again, <q>to them gave He power to become the sons of God. </q> Now the child born of any one is entirely of a kindred nature with his parent. If, then, you have received <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if you have become a child of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, make manifest in your disposition the God that is in you, manifest in yourself Him that begot you. By the same marks whereby we recognize <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must this relationship to God of the son so born be exhibited. <q>He opens His hand and fills every living thing with His good pleasure.</q> <q>He passes over transgressions.</q> <q>He <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">repents</a> Him of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <q>The Lord is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to all, and brings not on us His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> every day.</q> <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a righteous Lord, and there is no <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> in Him ;</q> and all other sayings of the like kind which are scattered for our instruction throughout the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>&mdash;if you live amidst such things as these, you are a child of God indeed; but if you continue with the characteristic marks of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> in you, it is in vain that you babble to yourself of your birth from above. Prophecy will speak against you and say, <q>You are a '<a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>,' not a son of the Most High. You '<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> vanity, and seek after leasing.' Know you not in what way man is 'made admirable '? In no other way than by becoming <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.</q></p>

<p>It will be necessary to add to what has been said this remaining statement also; viz. that those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which are held out in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> to those who have led a godly life, are not such as can be precisely described. For how is that possible with things which <q>eye has not seen, neither ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man </q>? Indeed, the sinner's life of torment presents no equivalent to anything that pains the sense here. Even if some one of the punishments in that other world be named in terms that are well known here, the distinction is still not small. When you hear the word fire, you have been taught to think of a fire other than the fire we see, owing to something being added to that fire which in this there is not; for that fire is never quenched, whereas experience has discovered many ways of quenching this; and there is a great difference between a fire which can be extinguished, and one that does not admit of extinction. That fire, therefore, is something other than this. If, again, a person hears the word <q>worm,</q> let not his thoughts, from the similarity of the term, be carried to the creature here that crawls upon the ground; for the addition that it <q>dies not</q> suggests the thought of another reptile than that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> here. Since, then, these things are set before us as to be expected in the life that follows this, being the natural outgrowth according to the righteous judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the life of each, of his particular disposition, it must be the part of the wise not to regard the present, but that which follows after, and to lay down the foundations for that unspeakable blessedness during this short and fleeting life, and by a good choice to wean themselves from all experience of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, now in their lifetime here, hereafter in their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> recompense. </p>
