<h1>The Great Catechism (Part I, The Trinity)</h1>

<h2>Prologue.</h2>

<p>The presiding ministers of the <q><a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of godliness</q> <span class="stiki" id="note291934"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:16</a></span> have need of a system in their instructions, in order that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may be replenished by the accession of such as should be saved <span class="stiki" id="note291935"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse47">Acts&nbsp;2:47</a></span>, through the teaching of the word of Faith being brought home to the hearing of unbelievers. Not that the same method of instruction will be suitable in the case of all who approach the word. The catechism must be adapted to the diversities of their religious worship; with an eye, indeed, to the one aim and end of the system, but not using the same method of preparation in each individual case. The <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaizer</a> has been preoccupied with one set of notions, one conversant with Hellenism, with others; while the Anom&oelig;an, and the Manichee, with the followers of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> , <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> , and the rest on the list of those who have wandered into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, each of them being prepossessed with their peculiar notions, necessitate a special controversy with their several. opinions. The method of recovery must be adapted to the form of the disease. You will not by the same means cure the <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a> of the Greek, and the unbelief of the Jew as to the Only-begotten God: nor as regards those who have wandered into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> will you, by the same arguments in each case, upset their misleading romances as to the tenets of the Faith. No one could set Sabellius  right by the same instruction as would benefit the Anom&oelig;an.  The controversy with the Manichee is profitless against the Jew.  It is necessary, therefore, as I have said, to regard the opinions which the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have taken up, and to frame your argument in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> into which each has fallen, by advancing in each discussion certain principles and reasonable propositions, that thus, through what is agreed upon on both sides, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may conclusively be brought to light. When, then, a discussion is held with one of those who favour Greek ideas, it would be well to make the ascertaining of this the commencement of the reasoning, <em>i.e.</em> whether he presupposes the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or concurs with the atheistic view. Should he say there is no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, from the consideration of the skilful and wise economy of the Universe he will be brought to acknowledge that there is a certain overmastering power manifested through these channels. If, on the other hand, he should have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of Deity, but should be inclined to entertain the presumption of a plurality of Gods, then we will adopt against him some such train of reasoning as this: <q>does he think Deity is perfect or defective?</q> and if, as is likely, he bears testimony to the perfection in the Divine nature, then we will demand of him to grant a perfection throughout in everything that is observable in that divinity, in order that Deity may not be regarded as a mixture of opposites, defect and perfection. But whether as respects power, or the conception of goodness, or wisdom and imperishability and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, or any other notion besides suitable to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Deity, that is found to lie close to the subject of our <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, in all he will agree that perfection is the idea to be entertained of the Divine nature, as being a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> inference from these premises. If this, then, be granted us, it would not be difficult to bring round these scattered notions of a plurality of Gods to the acknowledgment of a unity of Deity. For if he admits that perfection is in every respect to be ascribed to the subject before us, though there is a plurality of these perfect things which are marked with the same character, he must be required by a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> necessity, either to point out the particularity in each of these things which present no distinctive variation, but are found always with the same marks, or, if (he cannot do that, and) the mind can grasp nothing in them in the way of particular, to give up the idea of any distinction. For if neither as regards <q>more and less</q> a person can detect a difference (in as much as the idea of perfection does not admit of it), nor as regards <q>worse</q> and <q>better</q> (for he cannot entertain a notion of Deity at all where the term <q>worse</q> is not got rid of), nor as regards <q>ancient</q> and <q>modern</q> (for what exists not for ever is foreign to the notion of Deity), but on the contrary the idea of Godhead is one and the same, no peculiarity being on any ground of reason to be discovered in any one point, it is an absolute necessity that the mistaken fancy of a plurality of Gods would be forced to the acknowledgment of a unity of Deity. For if goodness, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and wisdom, and power may be equally predicated of it, then also imperishability and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and every <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> idea would be in the same way admitted. As then all distinctive difference in any aspect whatever has been gradually removed, it necessarily follows that together with it a plurality of Gods has been removed from his belief, the general identity bringing round conviction to the Unity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>But since our system of religion is wont to observe a distinction of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the unity of the Nature, to prevent our argument in our contention with Greeks sinking to the level of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a> there is need again of a distinct technical statement in order to correct all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> on this point.</p>

<p>For not even by those who are external to our doctrine is the Deity held to be without <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>.  Now this admission of theirs will quite enable our argument to be unfolded. For he who admits that God is not without <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, will agree that a being who is not without <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> (or word) certainly possesses <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>. Now it is to be observed that the utterance of man is expressed by the same term. If, then, he should say that he understands what the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> of God is according to the analogy of things with us, he will thus be led on to a loftier idea, it being an absolute necessity for him to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the utterance, just as everything else, corresponds with the nature. Though, that is, there is a certain sort of force, and life, and wisdom, observed in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> subject, yet no one from the similarity of the terms would suppose that the life, or power, or wisdom, were in the case of God of such a sort as that, but the significations of all such terms are lowered to accord with the standard of our nature. For since our nature is liable to corruption and weak, therefore is our life short, our strength unsubstantial, our word unstable.  But in that transcendent nature, through the greatness of the subject contemplated, every thing that is said about it is elevated with it. Therefore though mention be made of God's Word it will not be thought of as having its realization in the utterance of what is spoken, and as then vanishing away, like our speech, into the nonexistent. On the contrary, as our nature, liable as it is to come to an end, is endued with speech which likewise comes to an end, so that, imperishable and ever-existing nature has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and substantial speech. If, then, logic requires him to admit this <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> subsistence of God's Word, it is altogether necessary to admit also that the subsistence  of that word consists in a living state; for it is an impiety to suppose that the Word has a soulless subsistence after the manner of stones. But if it subsists, being as it is something with <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and without body, then certainly it lives, whereas if it be <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> from life, then as certainly it does not subsist; but this idea that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> does not subsist, has been shown to be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. By consequence, therefore, it has also been shown that the Word is to be considered as in a living condition. And since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> is reasonably <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be simple, and exhibits in itself no duplicity or combination, no one would contemplate the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the living <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> as dependent on a mere participation of life, for such a supposition, which is to say that one thing is within another, would not exclude the idea of compositeness; but, since the simplicity has been admitted, we are compelled to think that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a> has an independent life, and not a mere participation of life. If, then, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos</a>, as being life, lives , it certainly has the faculty of will, for no one of living creatures is without such a faculty. Moreover that such a will has also capacity to act must be the conclusion of a devout mind. For if you admit not this potency, you prove the reverse to exist. But no; impotence is quite removed from our conception of Deity. Nothing of incongruity is to be observed in connection with the Divine nature, but it is absolutely necessary to admit that the power of that word is as great as the purpose, lest mixture, or concurrence, of contradictions be found in an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> that is incomposite, as would be the case if, in the same purpose, we were to detect both impotence and power, if, that is, there were power to do one thing, but no power to do something else. Also we must suppose that this will in its power to do all things will have no tendency to anything that is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (for impulse towards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is foreign to the Divine nature), but that whatever is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, this it also wishes, and, wishing, is able to perform, and, being able, will not fail to perform ; but that it will bring all its proposals for good to effectual accomplishment. Now the world <em>is</em> good, and all its contents are seen to be wisely and skilfully ordered. All of them, therefore, are the works of the Word, of one who, while He lives and subsists, in that He is God's Word, has a will too, in that He lives; of one too who has power to effect what He wills, and who wills what is absolutely good and wise and all else that connotes superiority. Whereas, then, the world is admitted to be something good, and from what has been said the world has been shown to be the work of the Word, who both wills and is able to effect the good, this Word is other than He of whom He is the Word. For this, too, to a certain extent is a term of <q>relation,</q> inasmuch as the Father of the Word must needs be thought of with the Word, for it would not be word were it not a word of some one. If, then, the mind of the hearers, from the relative meaning of the term, makes a distinction between the Word and Him from whom He proceeds, we should find that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, in its contention with the Greek conceptions, would not be in danger of coinciding with those who prefer the beliefs of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. But it will equally escape the absurdity of either party, by acknowledging both that the living <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is an effective and creative being, which is what the Jew refuses to receive, and also that the Word itself, and He from whom He is, do not differ in their nature. As in our own case we say that the word is from the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and no more entirely the same as the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, than altogether other than it (for, by its being from it, it is something else, and not it; still by its bringing the mind in evidence it can no longer be considered as something other than it; and so it is in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> one with <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, while as a subject it is different), in like manner, too, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> by its self-subsistence is distinct from Him from whom it has its subsistence; and yet by exhibiting in itself those qualities which are recognized in God it is the same in nature with Him who is recognizable by the same distinctive marks. For whether one adopts goodness , or power, or wisdom, or <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, or the incapability of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, death, and decay, or an entire perfection, or anything whatever of the kind, to mark one's conception of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by means of the same marks he will find the Word that subsists from Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>As, then, by the higher mystical ascent  from matters that concern ourselves to that transcendent nature we gain a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Word, by the same method we shall be led on to a conception of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, by observing in our own nature certain shadows and resemblances of His ineffable power. Now in us the spirit (or breath) is the drawing of the air, a matter other than ourselves, inhaled and breathed out for the necessary sustainment of the body. This, on the occasion of uttering the word, becomes an utterance which expresses in itself the meaning of the word. And in the case of the Divine nature it has been deemed a point of our religion that there is a <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, just as it has been allowed that there is a <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, because of the inconsistency of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> being deficient as compared with our word, if, while this word of ours is contemplated in connection with spirit, that other Word were to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be quite unconnected with spirit. Not indeed that it is a thought proper to entertain of Deity, that after the manner of our breath something foreign from without flows into <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in Him becomes the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; but when we think of God's Word we do not deem the Word to be something unsubstantial, nor the result of instruction, nor an utterance of the voice, nor what after being uttered passes away, nor what is subject to any other condition such as those which are observed in our word, but to be essentially self-subsisting, with a faculty of will ever-working, all-powerful. The like doctrine have we received as to God's Spirit; we regard it as that which goes with the Word and manifests its energy, and not as a mere effluence of the breath; for by such a conception the grandeur of the Divine power would be reduced and humiliated, that is, if the Spirit that is in it were supposed to resemble ours. But we conceive of it as an essential power, regarded as self-centred in its own proper person, yet equally incapable of being separated from God in Whom it is, or from the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> whom it accompanies, as from melting into nothingness; but as being, after the likeness of God's Word, existing as a person , able to will, self-moved, efficient, ever choosing the good, and for its every purpose having its power concurrent with its will.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>And so one who severely studies the depths of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, receives secretly in his spirit, indeed, a moderate amount of apprehension of the doctrine of God's nature, yet he is unable to explain clearly in words the ineffable depth of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. As, for instance, how the same thing is capable of being numbered and yet rejects numeration, how it is observed with distinctions yet is apprehended as a <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">monad</a>, how it is separate as to personality yet is not divided as to subject matter.  For, in personality, the Spirit is one thing and the Word another, and yet again that from which the Word and Spirit is, another. But when you have gained the conception of what the distinction is in these, the oneness, again, of the nature admits not division, so that the supremacy of the one First Cause is not split and cut up into differing Godships, neither does the statement harmonize with the Jewish dogma, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> passes in the mean between these two conceptions, destroying each <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and yet accepting what is useful to it from each. The Jewish dogma is destroyed by the acceptance of the Word, and by the belief in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; while the polytheistic <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the Greek school is made to vanish by the unity of the Nature abrogating this imagination of plurality. While yet again, of the Jewish conception, let the unity of the Nature stand; and of the Hellenistic, only the distinction as to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; the remedy against a profane view being thus applied, as required, on either side. For it is as if the number of the triad were a remedy in the case of those who are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> as to the One, and the assertion of the unity for those whose beliefs are dispersed among a number of divinities.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>But should it be the Jew who gainsays these arguments, our discussion with him will no longer present equal difficulty , since the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> will be made manifest out of those doctrines on which he has been brought up. For that there is a <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, powers essentially subsisting, both creative of whatever has come into being, and comprehensive of things that exist, is shown in the clearest light out of the Divinely-inspired Scriptures. It is enough if we call to mind one testimony, and leave the discovery of more to those who are inclined to take the trouble. <q>By the Word of the Lord,</q> it is said, <q>the heavens were established, and all the power of them by the breath of His mouth. </q> What word and what breath? For the Word is not mere speech, nor that breath mere breathing. Would not the Deity be brought down to the level of the likeness of our <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, were it held as a doctrine that the Maker of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> used such word and such breath as this? What power arising from speech or breathing could there be of such a kind as would suffice for the establishment of the heavens and the powers that are therein? For if the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is like our speech, and His Breath is like our breath, then from these like things there must certainly come a likeness of power; and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> has just so much force as our word, and no more. But the words that come from us and the breath that accompanies their utterance are ineffective and unsubstantial. Thus, they who would bring down the Deity to a similarity with the word as with us render also the Divine word and spirit altogether ineffective and unsubstantial. But if, as David says, <q>By the Word of the Lord were the heavens established, and their powers had their framing by His breath,</q> then has the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> been confirmed, which instructs us to speak of a word as in essential being, and a breath as in personality.</p>
