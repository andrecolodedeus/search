<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book III</h1>

<h2>Chapter 22. Of the Question Whether the Evangelists are All at One on the Subject of the Narrative Regarding Joseph, Who Begged the Lord's Body from Pilate, and Whether John's Version Contains Any Statements at Variance with Each Other.</h2>

<p>59. Matthew proceeds as follows: <q>Now when the evening had come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>: he went to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and begged the body of Jesus. Then <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> commanded the body to be delivered.</q>  Mark presents it in this form: <q>And now when the evening had come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, Joseph of Arimathea, an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> councillor, which also waited for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, came, and went in boldly unto <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and craved the body of Jesus. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> marvelled if He were already dead: and, calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether He had been any while  dead. And when he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</q>  Luke's report runs in these terms: <q>And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a councillor; and he was a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, and a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> (the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them): he was of Arimathea, a city of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: who also himself waited for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. This man went unto <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and begged the body of Jesus.</q>  John, on the other hand, first narrates the breaking of the legs of those who had been crucified with the Lord, and the piercing of the Lord's side with the lance (which whole passage has been recorded by him alone), and then subjoins a statement which is of the same tenor with what is given by the other <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>. It proceeds in these terms: <q>And after this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, but secretly for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, besought <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> that he might take away the body of Jesus: and <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</q>  There is nothing here to give any one of them the appearance of being in antagonism with another. But some one may perhaps ask whether John is not inconsistent with himself, when he at once unites with the rest in telling us how Joseph begged the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and comes forward as the only one who states here that Joseph had been a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> secretly for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For the question may reasonably be raised as to how it happened that the man who had been a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> secretly for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> had the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to beg His body&mdash; a thing which not one of those who were His open followers was bold enough to do. We must understand, however, that this man did so in the confidence which his dignified position gave him, the possession of which rendered it possible for him to make his way on familiar terms into <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> presence. And we must suppose, further, that in the performance of that last service relating to the interment, he cared less for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, however he tried in ordinary circumstances, when hearing the Lord, to avoid exposing himself to their enmity.</p>
