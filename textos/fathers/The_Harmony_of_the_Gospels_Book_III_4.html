<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book III</h1>

<h2>Chapter 4. Of What Took Place in the Piece of Ground or Garden to Which They Came on Leaving the House After the Supper; And of the Method in Which, in John's Silence on the Subject, a Real Harmony Can Be Demonstrated Between the Other Three Evangelists&mdash; Namely, Matthew, Mark, and Luke.</h2>

<p>10. Matthew then proceeds with his narrative in the same connection as follows: <q>Then comes Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane.</q>  This is mentioned also by Mark.  Luke, too, refers to it, although he does not notice the piece of ground by name. For he says: <q>And He came out, and went, as was His wont, to the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount of Olives</a>; and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> also followed Him. And when He was at the place, He said unto them, Pray that you enter not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q>  That is the place which the other two have instanced under the name of Gethsemane. There, we understand, was the garden which John brings into notice when he gives the following narration: <q>When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which He entered, and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</q>  Then taking Matthew's record, we get this statement next in order: <q>He said unto His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, Sit ye here, while I go and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> yonder.  And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. Then says He unto them, My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. And He went a little farther, and fell on His face, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as You will. And He comes unto the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and finds them asleep, and says unto Peter, What! could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, that you enter not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. He went away again the second time, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it, Your will be done. And He came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. And He left them, and went away again, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> the third time, saying the same words. Then comes He to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and says unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that shall betray me.</q> </p>

<p>11. Mark also records these passages, introducing them quite in the same method and succession. Some of the sentences, however, are given with greater brevity by him, and others are somewhat more fully explained. These sayings of our Lord, indeed, may seem in one portion to stand in some manner of contradiction to each other as they are presented in Matthew's version. I refer to the fact that [it is stated there that] He came to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after His third <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and said to them, <q>Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that shall betray me.</q> For what are we to make of the direction thus given above, <q>Sleep on now, and take your rest,</q> when there is immediately subjoined this other declaration, <q>Behold, the hour is at hand,</q> and thereafter also the instruction, <q>Arise, let us be going</q>? Those readers who perceive something like a contradiction here, seek to pronounce these words, <q>Sleep on now, and take your rest,</q> in a way betokening that they were spoken in reproach, and not in permission. And this is an expedient which might quite fairly be adopted were there any necessity for it. Mark, however, has reproduced these sayings in a manner which implies that after He had expressed himself in the terms, <q>Sleep on now, and take your rest,</q> He added the words, <q>It is enough,</q> and then appended to these the further statement, <q>The hour has come; behold, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be betrayed.</q>  Hence we may conclude that the case really stood thus: namely, that after addressing these words to them, <q>Sleep on now, and take your rest,</q> the Lord was silent for a space, so that what He had thus given them permission to do might be [seen to be] really acted upon; and that thereafter He made the other declaration, <q>Behold the hour has come.</q> Thus it is that in Mark's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> we find those words [regarding the sleeping] followed immediately by the phrase, <q>It is enough;</q> that is to say, <q>the rest which you have had is enough now.</q> But as no distinct notice is introduced of this silence on the Lord's part which intervened then, the passage comes to be understood in a forced manner, and it is supposed that a peculiar pronunciation must be given to these words.</p>

<p>12. Luke, on the other hand, has omitted to mention the number of times that He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>. He has told us, however, a fact which is not recorded by the others&mdash; namely, that when He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> He was strengthened by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and that, as He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> more earnestly, He had a bloody sweat, with drops falling down to the ground. Thus it appears that when he makes the statement, <q>And when He rose up from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and had come to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,</q> he does not indicate how often He had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> by that time. But still, in so doing, he does not stand in any kind of antagonism to the other two. Moreover, John does indeed mention how He entered into the garden along with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. But he does not relate how He was occupied there up to the period when His betrayer came in along with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to apprehend Him.</p>

<p>13. These three <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, therefore, have in this manner narrated the same incident, just as, on the other hand, one man might give three several accounts of a single occurrence, with a certain measure of diversity in his statements, and yet without any real contradiction. Luke, for example, has specified the distance to which He went forward from the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>&mdash; that is to say, when He withdrew from them in order to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>&mdash; more definitely than the others. For he tells us that it was <q>about a stone's cast.</q> Mark, again, states first of all in his own words how the Lord <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that, <q>If it were possible, the hour might pass from Him,</q> referring to the hour of His Passion, which he also expresses presently by the term <q>cup.</q> He then reproduces the Lord's own words, in the following manner: <q>Abba, Father, all things are possible to You: take away this cup from me.</q> And if we connect with these terms the clause which is given by the other two <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, and for which Mark himself has also already introduced a clear parallel, presented as a statement made in his own person instead of the Lord's, the whole sentence will be exhibited in this form: <q>Father, if it be possible, (for) all things are possible unto You, take away this cup from me.</q> And it will be so put just to prevent any one from supposing that He made the Father's power less than it is when He said, <q>If it be possible.</q> For thus His words were not, <q>If You can do it;</q> but <q>If it be possible.</q> And anything is possible which He wills. Therefore, the expression, <q>If it be possible,</q> has here just the same force as, <q>If You will.</q> For Mark has made the sense in which the phrase, <q>If it be possible,</q> is to be taken quite plain, when he says, <q>All things are possible unto You.</q> And further, the fact that these writers have recorded how He said, <q>Nevertheless, not what I will, but what You will</q> (an expression which means precisely the same as this other form, <q>Nevertheless, not my will but Yours be done</q>), shows us clearly enough that it was with reference not to any absolute impossibility on the Father's side, but only to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, that these words, <q>If it be possible,</q> were spoken. This is made the more apparent by the plainer statement which Luke has presented to the same effect. For his version is not, <q>If it be possible,</q> but, <q>If You be willing.</q> And to this clearer declaration of what was really meant we may add, with the effect of still greater clearness, the clause which Mark has inserted, so that the whole will proceed thus: <q>If You be willing, (for) all things are possible unto You, take away this cup from me.</q></p>

<p>14. Again, as to Mark's mentioning that the Lord said not only <q>Father,</q> but <q>Abba, Father,</q> the explanation simply is, that <q>Abba</q> is in Hebrew exactly what <q>Pater</q> is in Latin. And perhaps the Lord may have used both words with some kind of <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> significance, intending to indicate thereby, that in sustaining this sorrow He bore the part of His body, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of which He has been made the corner-stone, and which comes to Him [in the person of <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> gathered] partly out of the Hebrews, to whom He refers when He says <q>Abba,</q> and partly out of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, to whom He refers when He says <q>Pater</q> [Father].  The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> also makes use of the same significant expression. For he says, <q>In whom we cry, Abba, Father;</q>  and, in another passage, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent His Spirit into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</q>  For it was meet that the good Master and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Saviour, by sharing in the sufferings of the more infirm,  should in His own person illustrate the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that His witnesses ought not to despair, although it might perchance happen that, through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> frailty, sorrow might steal in upon their hearts at the time of suffering; seeing that they would overcome it if, mindful that God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what is best for those whose well-being He regards, they gave His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> the preference over their own. On this subject, however, as a whole, the present is not the time for entering on any more detailed discussion. For we have to deal simply with the question concerning the harmony of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, from whose varied modes of narration we gather the wholesome lesson that, in order to get at the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the one essential thing to aim at in dealing with the terms is simply the intention which the speaker had in view in using them. For the word <q>Father</q> means just the same as the phrase <q>Abba, Father.</q> But with a view to bring out the mystic significance, the expression, <q>Abba, Father,</q> is the clearer form; while, for indicating the unity, the word <q>Father</q> is sufficient. And that the Lord did indeed employ this method of address, <q>Abba, Father,</q> must be accepted as matter of fact. But still His intention would not appear very obvious were there not the means (since others use simply the term <q>Father</q>) to show that under such a form of expression those two Churches, which are constituted, the one out of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and the other out of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, are presented as also really one. In this way, then, [we may suppose that] the phrase, <q>Abba, Father,</q> was adopted in order to convey the same idea as was indicated by the Lord on another occasion, when He said, <q>Other sheep I have which are not of this fold.</q>  In these words He certainly referred to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, since He had sheep also among the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. But in that passage He goes on immediately to add the declaration, <q>Them also I must bring, that there may be one fold and one Shepherd.</q> And so we may say that, just as the phrase, <q>Abba, Father,</q> contains the idea of [the two races,] the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, the word <q>Father,</q> used alone, points to the one flock which these two constitute.</p>
