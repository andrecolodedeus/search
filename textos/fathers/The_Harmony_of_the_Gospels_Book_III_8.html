<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book III</h1>

<h2>Chapter 8. Of the Absence of Any Discrepancies in the Accounts Which the Evangelists Give of What Took Place in Pilate's Presence.</h2>

<p>32. He next proceeds as follows: <q>And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked Him, saying, Are you the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? Jesus says unto him, You say. And when He was accused of the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and elders, He answered nothing. Then says <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> unto Him, Do you not hear how many things they <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against you? And He answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly. Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would. And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. Therefore when they were gathered together, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said unto them, Whom will you that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ? For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that for <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> they had delivered Him. But when he was set down on the judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> because of him. But the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. But the governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the two will you that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified. The governor said to them, Why, what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified. When <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person; see ye to it. Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. Then released he Barabbas unto them; and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered Him to them to be crucified.</q>  These are the things which Matthew has reported to have been done to the Lord by <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>.</p>

<p>33. Mark also presents an almost entire identity with the above, both in language and in subject. The words, however, in which <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> replied to the people when they asked him to release one prisoner according to the custom of the feast, are reported by this <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> as follows: <q>But <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?</q>  On the other hand, Matthew gives them thus: <q>Therefore when they were gathered together, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said unto them, Whom will you that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?</q> There need be no difficulty in the circumstance that Matthew says nothing about the people having requested that one should be released unto them. But it may fairly be asked, what were the words which <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> actually uttered, whether these reported by Matthew, or those recited by Mark. For there seems to be some difference between these two forms of expression, namely, <q>Whom will you that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?</q> and, <q>Will ye that I release unto you the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?</q> Nevertheless, as they were in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of calling their kings <q>anointed ones,</q>  and one might use the one term or the other,  it is evident that what <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> asked them was whether they would have the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that is, the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, released unto them. And it matters nothing to the real identity in meaning that Mark, desiring simply to relate what concerned the Lord Himself, has not mentioned Barabbas here. For, in the report which he gives of their reply, he indicates with sufficient clearness who the person was whom they asked to have released unto them. His version is this: <q>But the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</q> Then he proceeds to add the sentence, <q>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> answered and said again unto them, What will you then that I should do unto him whom you call the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?</q> This makes it plain enough now, that in speaking of the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, Mark meant to express the very sense which Matthew intended to convey by using the term <q>Christ.</q> For kings were not called <q>anointed ones</q>  except among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and the form which Matthew gives to the words in question is this, <q><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?</q> So Mark continues, <q>And they cried out again, Crucify him:</q> which appears thus in Matthew, <q>They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</q> Again Mark goes on, <q>Then <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said unto them Why, what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</q> Matthew has not recorded this passage; but he has introduced the statement, <q>When <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made,</q> and has also informed us how he washed his hands before the people with the view of declaring himself innocent of the blood of that just person (a circumstance not reported by Mark and the others). And thus he has also shown us with all due plainness how the governor dealt with the people with the intention of securing His release. This has been briefly referred to by Mark, when he tells us that <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said, <q>Why, what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has he done?</q> And thereupon Mark also concludes his account of what took place between <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> and the Lord in these terms: <q>And so <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged Him, to be crucified.</q> The above is Mark's recital of what occurred in presence of the governor. </p>

<p>34. Luke gives the following version of what took place in presence of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: <q>And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to C&aelig;sar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.</q>  The previous two <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> have not recorded these words, although they do mention the fact that these parties accused Him. Luke is thus the one who has specified the terms of the false accusations which were brought against Him. On the other hand, he does not state that <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said to Him, <q>Do you answer nothing? Behold, how many things they <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against you.</q> Instead of introducing these sentences, Luke goes on to relate other matters which are also reported by these two. Thus he continues: <q>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> asked Him, saying, Are you the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? And He answered him and said, You say.</q> Matthew and Mark have likewise inserted this fact, previous to the statement that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was taken to task for not answering His accusers. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, however, is not at all affected by the order in which Luke has narrated these things; and as little is it affected by the mere circumstance that one writer passes over some incident without notice, which another expressly specifies. We have an instance in what follows; namely, <q>Then said <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and to the people, I find no fault in this man. And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> to this place. But when <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> heard of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, he asked whether the man were a <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilean</a>. And as soon as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He belonged unto <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> jurisdiction, he sent Him to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. And when <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad; for he was desirous to see Him of a long season, because he had heard many things of Him, and he hoped to see some <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> done by Him. Then he questioned with Him in many words; but He answered him nothing. And the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> stood and vehemently accused Him. And <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> with his men of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> set Him at nought, and mocked Him, and arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him again to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>. And the same day <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</q>  All these things are related by Luke alone, namely, the fact that the Lord was sent by <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, and the account of what took place on that occasion. At the same time, among the statements which he makes in this passage, there are some bearing a resemblance to matters which may be found reported by the other <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> in connection with different portions of their narrations. But the immediate object of these others, however, was to recount simply the various things which were done in <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> presence on to the time when the Lord was delivered over to be crucified. In accordance with his own plan, however, Luke makes the above digression with the view of telling what occurred with <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>; and after that he reverts to the history of what took place in the governor's presence. Thus he now continues as follows: <q>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, when he had called together the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the rulers and the people, said unto them, You have brought this man unto me as one that perverts the people: and, behold, I having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him.</q>  Here we notice that he has omitted to mention how <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> asked the Lord what answer He had to make to His accusers. Thereafter he proceeds in these terms: <q>No, nor yet <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>: for I sent you to him: and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. I will therefore chastise him and release him. For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast. And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas; who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, was cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, therefore, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them. But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. And he said unto them the third time, Why, what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has he done? I have found no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and let him go. And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that He might be crucified; and the voices of them  prevailed.</q>  The repeated effort which <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, in his desire to accomplish the release of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, thus made to gain the people's consent, is satisfactorily attested by Matthew, although in a very few words, when he says, <q>But when <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made.</q> For he would not have made such a statement at all, had not <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> exerted himself earnestly in that direction, although at the same time he has not told us how often he made such attempts to rescue Jesus from their fury. Accordingly, Luke concludes his report of what took place in the governor's presence in this fashion: <q>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> gave sentence that it should be as they required. And he released unto them him that for sedition and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> was cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, whom they desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</q> </p>

<p>35. Let us next take the account of these same incidents&mdash; that is to say, those in which <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> was engaged&mdash; as it is presented by John. He proceeds thus: <q>And they themselves went not into the judgment-hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man? They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto you.</q>  We must look into this passage in order to show that it contains nothing inconsistent with Luke's version, which states that certain charges were brought against Him, and also specifies their terms. For Luke's words are these: <q>And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to C&aelig;sar, saying that he himself is Christ a king.</q> On the other hand, according to the paragraph which I have now cited from John, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> seem to have been unwilling to state any specific accusations, when <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> asked them, <q>What accusation bring ye against this man?</q> For their reply was, <q>If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto you;</q> the purport of which was, that he should accept their authority, cease to inquire what fault was alleged against Him, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him guilty for the simple reason that He had been [reckoned] worthy of being delivered up by them to him. This being the case, then, we ought to suppose that both these versions report words which were actually said, both the one before us at present, and the one given by Luke. For among the multitude of sayings and replies which passed between the parties, these writers have made their own selections as far as their judgment allowed them to go, and each of them has introduced into his narrative just what he considered sufficient. It is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that John himself mentions certain charges which were alleged against Him, and which we shall find in their proper connections. Here, then, he proceeds thus: <q>Then said <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, therefore, said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death; that the saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> might be fulfilled, which He spoke, signifying what death He should die. Then <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> entered into the judgment-hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto Him, Are you the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? And Jesus answered, Do you say this thing of yourself, or did others tell it you of me?</q>  This again may seem not to harmonize with what is recorded by the others&mdash;namely, <q>Jesus answered, You say,</q>&mdash; unless it is made clear in what follows that the one thing was said as well as the other. Hence he gives us to understand that the matters which he records next are [not to be regarded as] things never actually uttered by the Lord, but are rather to be considered things which have been passed over in silence by the other <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>. Mark, therefore, what remains of his narrative. It proceeds thus: <q><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation, and the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, have delivered you unto me: what have you done? Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; but now is my kingdom not from hence. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore said unto Him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king.</q>  Behold, here is the point at which he comes to that which the other <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> have reported. And then he goes on, the Lord being still the speaker, to recite other matters which the rest have not recorded. His terms are these: <q>To this end was I born, and for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> came I into the world, that I should bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> unto the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Every one that is of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> hears my voice. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says unto him, What is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and says unto them, I find no fault in him. But you have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will you, therefore, that I release unto you the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? Then cried they all again, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. Then <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, therefore, took Jesus, and scourged Him. And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on His head, and they put on Him a purple robe; and they came to Him and said, Hail, King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>! And they smote Him with their hands. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> went forth again, and says unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I find no fault in him. Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says unto them, Behold the man! When the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> therefore and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him; for I find no fault in him. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q>  This may fit in with what Luke reports to have been stated in the accusation brought by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>&mdash;namely, <q>We found this fellow perverting our nation,</q>&mdash; so that we might append here the reason given for it, <q>Because he made himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> John then goes on in the following strain: <q>When <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, therefore, heard that saying, he was the more afraid, and went again into the judgment-hall, and says unto Jesus, Whence are you? But Jesus gave him no answer. Then says <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> unto Him, Do you not speak unto me? Do you not know that I have power to crucify you, and have power to release you? Jesus answered, You could have no power at all against me, except it were given you from above: therefore he that delivered me unto you has the greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. From thenceforth <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> sought to release Him: but the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> cried out, saying, If you let this man go, you are not C&aelig;sar's friend: whosoever makes himself a king, speaks against C&aelig;sar.</q>  This may very well agree with what Luke records in connection with the said accusation brought by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For after the words, <q>We found this fellow perverting our nation,</q> he has added the clause, <q>And forbidding to give tribute to C&aelig;sar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.</q> This will also offer a solution for the difficulty previously referred to, namely, the occasion which might seem to be given for supposing John to have indicated that no specific charge was laid by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> against the Lord, when they answered and said unto him, <q>If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto you.</q> John then continues in the following strain: <q>When <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment-seat, in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour; and he says unto the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, Behold your King? But they cried out, Away with him, crucify him. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says unto them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> answered, We have no king but C&aelig;sar. Then delivered he Him therefore unto them to be crucified.</q>  The above is John's version of what was done by <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>. </p>
