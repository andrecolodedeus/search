<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book II</h1>

<h2>Chapter 11. An Examination of the Question as to How It Was Possible for Them to Go Up, According to Luke's Statement, with Him to Jerusalem to the Temple, When the Days of the Purification of the Mother of Christ Were Accomplished, in Order to Perform the Usual Rites, If It is Correctly Recorded by Matthew, that Herod Had Already Learned from the Wise Men that the Child Was Born in Whose Stead, When He Sought for Him, He Slew So Many Children.</h2>

<p>24. Hereby also we see how another question is solved, if any one indeed finds a difficulty in it. I allude to the question as to how it was possible, on the supposition that the elder <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> was already anxious (to obtain information regarding Him), and agitated by the intelligence received from the wise men concerning the birth of the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, for them, when the days of the purification of His mother were accomplished, to go up in any safety with Him to the temple, in order to see to the performance of those things which were according to the law of the Lord, and which are specified by Luke.  For who can fail to perceive that this solitary day might very easily have escaped the notice of a king, whose attention was engaged with a multitude of affairs? Or if it does not appear probable that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, who was waiting in the extremest anxiety to see what report the wise men would bring back to him concerning the child, should have been so long in finding out how he had been mocked, that, only after the mother's purification was already past, and the solemnities proper to the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> were performed with respect to the child in the temple, nay more, only after their departure into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, did it come into his mind to seek the life of the child, and to slay so many little ones&mdash;if, I say, any one finds a difficulty in this, I shall not pause to state the numerous and important occupations by which the king's attention may have been engaged, and for the space of many days either wholly diverted from such thoughts, or prevented from following them out. For it is not possible to enumerate all the cases which might have made that perfectly possible. No one, however, is so <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs as either to deny or to question that there may very easily have been many such matters of importance (to preoccupy the king). For to whom will not the thought occur, that reports, whether <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or false, of many other more terrible things may possibly have been brought to the king, so that the person who had been apprehensive of a certain royal child, who after a number of years might prove an adversary to himself or to his sons, might be so agitated with the terrors of certain more immediate dangers, as to have his attention forcibly removed from that earlier anxiety, and engaged rather with the devising of measures to ward off other more instantly threatening perils? Wherefore, leaving all such considerations unspecified, I simply venture on the assertion that, when the wise men failed to bring back any report to him, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> may have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that they had been misled by a deceptive vision of a star, and that, after their want of success in discovering Him whom they had supposed to have been born, they had been ashamed to return to him; and that in this way the king, having his fears allayed, had given up the idea of asking after and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> the child. Consequently, when they had gone with Him to Jerusalem after the purification of His mother, and when those things had been performed in the temple which are recounted by Luke,  inasmuch as the words which were spoken by Simeon and Anna in their prophesyings regarding Him, when publicity began to be given to them by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who had heard them, were like to call back the king's mind then to its original design, Joseph <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the warning conveyed to him in the dream, and fled with the child and His mother into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Afterwards, when the things which had been done and said in the temple were made quite public, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> perceived that he had been mocked; and then, in his desire to get at the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he slew the multitude of children, as Matthew records. </p>
