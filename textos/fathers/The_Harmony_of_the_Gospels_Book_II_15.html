<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book II</h1>

<h2>Chapter 15. An Explanation of the Circumstance That, According to the Evangelist John, John the Baptist Says, <q>I Knew Him Not;</q> While, According to the Others, It is Found that He Did Already Know Him.</h2>

<p>32. Again, the account of the dove given in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to John does not mention the time at which the incident happened, but contains a statement of the words of John the Baptist as reporting what he saw. In this section, the question rises as to how it is said, <q>And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not: but He that sent me to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizes with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q>  For if he came to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him only at the time when he saw the dove descending upon Him, the inquiry is raised as to how he could have said to Him, as He came to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, <q>I ought rather to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by You.</q>  For the Baptist addressed Him thus before the dove descended. From this, however, it is evident that, although he did <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him [in a certain sense] before this time,&mdash; for he even leaped in his mother's womb when Mary visited <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a>, &mdash; there was yet something which was not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him up to this time, and which he learned by the descending of the dove,&mdash; namely, the fact that He <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> by a certain divine power proper to Himself; so that no man who received this <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even although he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> some, should be able to say that that which he imparted was his own, or that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was given by him.</p>
