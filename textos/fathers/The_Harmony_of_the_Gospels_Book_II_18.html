<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book II</h1>

<h2>Chapter 18. Of the Date of His Departure into Galilee.</h2>

<p>42. Furthermore, we must consider the question how the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John, before there is any mention of the casting of John the Baptist into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, tells us that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. For, after relating how He turned the water into wine at <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and how He came down to Capernaum with His mother and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and how they abode there not many days, he tells us that He went up then to Jerusalem on account of the passover; that after this He came into the land of Jud&aelig;a along with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and tarried there with them, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and then in what follows at this point the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says: <q>And John also was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> in &AElig;non, near to Salim, because there was much water there; and they came, and were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>: for John was not yet cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.</q>  On the other hand, Matthew says: <q>Now when He had heard that John was cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, Jesus departed into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</q>  In like manner, Mark's words are: <q>Now, after that John was put in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, Jesus came into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</q>  Luke, again, says nothing indeed about the imprisonment of John; but notwithstanding this, after his account of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he also makes a statement to the same effect with that of these other two, namely, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. For he has connected the several parts of his narrative here in this way: <q>And when all the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> was ended, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> departed from Him for a season; and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and there went out a fame of Him through all the region round about.</q>  From all this, however, we may gather, not that these three <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> have made any statement opposed to the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John, but only that they have left unrecorded the Lord's first advent in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; on which occasion also He turned the water into wine there. For at that period John had not yet been cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. And we are also to understand that these three <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> have introduced into the context of these narratives an account of another journey of His into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, which took place after John's imprisonment, regarding which return into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John himself furnishes the following notice: <q>When, therefore, Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> had heard that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> makes and baptizes more <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> than John (though Jesus Himself <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> not, but His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>), he left Jud&aelig;a, and departed again into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</q>  So, then, we perceive that by that time John had been already cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; and further, that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had heard that He was making and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> more <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> than John had made and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>
