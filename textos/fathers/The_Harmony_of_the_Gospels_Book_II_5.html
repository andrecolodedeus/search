<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book II</h1>

<h2>Chapter 5. A Statement of the Manner in Which Luke's Procedure is Proved to Be in Harmony with Matthew's in Those Matters Concerning the Conception and the Infancy or Boyhood of Christ, Which are Omitted by the One and Recorded by the Other.</h2>

<p>14. After the enumeration of the generations, Matthew proceeds thus: Now the birth of Christ  was on this wise. Whereas His mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.  What Matthew has omitted to state here regarding the way in which that came to pass, has been set forth by Luke after his account of the conception of John. His narrative is to the following effect: And in the sixth month the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> named <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, to a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David: and the virgin's name was Mary. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came in unto her, and said, Hail, you that are full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,  the Lord is with you: blessed are you among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. And when she saw  these things, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said unto her: Fear not, Mary; for you have found favour with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Behold, you shall conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call His name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David: and He shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever; and of His kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary unto the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, How shall this be, seeing I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not a man? And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> answered and said unto her, The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you: therefore also that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing which shall be born  shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;  and then follow matters not belonging to the question at present in hand. Now all this Matthew has recorded [summarily], when he tells us of Mary that <q>she was found with child of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> Neither is there any contradiction between the two <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, in so far as Luke has set forth in detail what Matthew has omitted to notice; for both bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that Mary conceived by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And in the same way there is no want of concord between them, when Matthew, in his turn, connects with the narrative something which Luke leaves out. For Matthew proceeds to give us the following statement: Then Joseph, her husband, being a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on these things, behold, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord appeared unto him in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, saying, Joseph, you son of David, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not to take unto you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call His name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, Behold, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son; and His name shall be called  <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, which, being interpreted, is, God with us. Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> her not till she had brought forth her <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> son;  and he called His name Jesus. Now when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> of Jud&aelig;a, in the days of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> the king, and so forth. </p>

<p>15. With respect to the city of <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, Matthew and Luke are at one. But Luke explains in what way and for what reason <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> came to it; whereas Matthew gives no such explanation. On the other hand, while Luke is silent on the subject of the journey of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> from the east, Matthew furnishes an account of it. That narrative he constructs as follows, in immediate connection with what he has already offered: Behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, Where is He that is born King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? For we have seen His star in the east, and have come to worship Him. Now, when <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> the king had heard these things, he was troubled.  And in this manner the account goes on, down to the passage where of these <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> it is written that, <q>being warned of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> that they should not return to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, they departed into their own country another way.</q>  This entire section is omitted by Luke, just as Matthew fails to mention some other circumstances which are mentioned by Luke: as, for example, that the Lord was laid in a <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>; and that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> announced His birth to the shepherds; and that there was with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> a multitude of the heavenly host praising <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and that the shepherds came and saw that that was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had announced to them; and that on the day of His <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> He received His name; as also the incidents reported by the same Luke to have occurred after the days of the purification of Mary were fulfilled&mdash;namely, their taking Him to Jerusalem, and the words spoken in the temple by Simeon or Anna concerning Him, when, filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, they recognized Him. Of all these things Matthew says nothing.</p>

<p>16. Hence, a subject which deserves inquiry is the question concerning the precise time when these events took place which are omitted by Matthew and given by Luke, and those, on the other hand, which have been omitted by Luke and given by Matthew. For after his account of the return of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> who had come from the east to their own country, Matthew proceeds to tell us how Joseph was warned by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to flee into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with the young child, to prevent His being <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>; and then how <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> failed to find Him, but slew the children from two years old and under; thereafter, how, when <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> was dead, Joseph returned from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and, on hearing that Archelaus reigned in Jud&aelig;a instead of his father <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, went to reside with the boy in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, at the city <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>. All these facts, again, are passed over by Luke. Nothing, however, like a want of harmony can be made out between the two writers merely on the ground that the latter states what the former omits, or that the former mentions what the latter leaves unnoticed. But the real question is as to the exact period at which these things could have taken place which Matthew has linked on to his narrative; to wit, the departure of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and their return from it after <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> death, and their residence at that time in the town of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, the very place to which Luke tells us that they went back after they had performed in the temple all things regarding the boy according to the law of the Lord. Here, accordingly, we have to take notice of a fact which will also hold good for other like cases, and which will secure our minds against similar agitation or disturbance in subsequent instances. I refer to the circumstance that each <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> constructs his own particular narrative on a kind of plan which gives it the appearance of being the complete and orderly record of the events in their succession. For, preserving a simple silence on the subject of those incidents of which he intends to give no account, he then connects those which he does wish to relate with what he has been immediately recounting, in such a manner as to make the recital seem continuous. At the same time, when one of them mentions facts of which the other has given no notice, the order of narrative, if carefully considered, will be found to indicate the point at which the writer by whom the omissions are made has taken the leap in his account, and thus has attached the facts, which it was his purpose to introduce, in such a manner to the preceding context as to give the appearance of a connected series, in which the one incident follows immediately on the other, without the interposition of anything else. On this principle, therefore, we understand that where he tells us how the wise men were warned in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> not to return to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, and how they went back to their own country by another way, Matthew has simply omitted all that Luke has related respecting all that happened to the Lord in the temple, and all that was said by Simeon and Anna; while, on the other hand, Luke has omitted in the same place all notice of the journey into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, which is given by Matthew, and has introduced the return to the city of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> as if it were immediately consecutive.</p>

<p>17. If any one wishes, however, to make up one complete narrative out of all that is said or left unsaid by these two <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> respectively, on the subject of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> nativity and infancy or boyhood, he may arrange the different statements in the following order:&mdash; Now the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was on this wise.  There was, in the days of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> the king of Jud&aelig;a, a certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named Zacharias, of the course of Abia; and his wife was of the daughters of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and her name was <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a>. And they were both righteous before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. And they had no child, because that <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a> was barren, and they both were well stricken in years. And it came to pass, that while he executed the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> office before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the order of his course, according to the custom of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> office, his lot was to burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> when he went into the temple of the Lord: and the whole multitude of the people were <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> without at the time of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>. And there appeared unto him an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>. And when Zacharias saw him he was troubled, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> fell upon him. But the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is heard; and your wife <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a> shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. And you shall have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>; and many shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at his birth. For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord: and he shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, even from his mother's womb. And many of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall he turn to the Lord their God. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people perfect  for the Lord. And Zacharias said unto the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, Whereby shall I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this? For I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, answering, said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and am sent to speak unto you, and to show you these glad tidings. And, behold, you shall be dumb,  and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because you have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried in the temple. And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless. And it came to pass that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house. And after those days his wife <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a> conceived, and hid herself five months, saying, Thus has the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein He looked upon me, to take away my reproach among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And in the sixth month the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, named <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, to a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came in unto her, and said, Hail, you that are full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,  the Lord is with you; blessed are you among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for you have found favour with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Behold, you shall conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call His name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David: and He shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever; and of His kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary unto the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, How shall this be, seeing I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not a man? And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> answered and said unto her, The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you: therefore also that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing which shall be born of you shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.  And, behold, your cousin <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a>, she has also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her who is called  barren. For with God nothing shall be impossible. And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to your word. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> departed from her. And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda; and entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a>. And it came to pass, that when <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a> heard the salutation of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, the babe leaped in her womb; and <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a> was filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: and she spoke out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed are you among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For, lo, as soon as the voice of your salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. And blessed are you that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>,  for there shall be a performance of those things which were told you from the Lord. And Mary said, My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does magnify the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour. For He has regarded the low estate of His handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. For He that is mighty has done to me great things, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> is His name. And His mercy is on them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him, from generation to generation. He has made  strength with His arm; He has scattered the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> in the imagination of their heart. He has put down the mighty from their seat, and exalted them of low degree. He has filled the hungry with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and the rich He has sent empty away. He has helped  His servant <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in remembrance of his mercy: as He spoke to our fathers, to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and to his seed for ever. And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.  Then it proceeds thus:&mdash; She was found with child of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.  Then Joseph her husband, being a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on these things, behold, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord appeared unto him in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, saying, Joseph, you son of David, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not to take unto you Mary your wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call His name Jesus: for He shall save His people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, Behold, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call His name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>; which, being interpreted, is, God with us. Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> her not. </p>

<p>Now  <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth's</a> full time came that she should be delivered, and she brought forth a son. And her neighbours and her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>  heard that the Lord magnified His mercy with her; and they congratulated her. And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called  him Zacharias, after the name of his father. And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John. And they said unto her, There is none of your kindred that is called by this name. And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all. And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue, and he spoke and praised God. And <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> came on all them that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Jud&aelig;a. And all they that had heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What manner of child, do you think, shall this be? For the hand of the Lord was with him. And his father Zacharias was filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and prophesied, saying, Blessed be the Lord God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; for He has visited and redeemed His people, and has raised up an horn of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for us in the house of His servant David; as He spoke by the mouth of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, which have been since the world began; (to give) <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from our enemies, and from the hand of all that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us: to perform mercy with our fathers, and to remember His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> covenant, the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which He swore to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> our father that He would give to us; in order that, being saved out of the hand of our enemies, we might serve Him without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and righteousness before Him, all our days. And you, child, shall be called the Prophet of the Highest: for you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways; to give <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> unto His people, for the remission  of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, through the tender mercy of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us, to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace. And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts until the day of his showing unto <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from C&aelig;sar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.  This first taxing  was made when Syrinus  was governor of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. And all went to be taxed,  every one into his own city. And Joseph also went up from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, out of the city of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, into Jud&aelig;a, unto the city of David, which is called <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be taxed  with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was, that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> son, and wrapped Him in swaddling-clothes, and laid Him in a <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>; because there was no room for them in the inn. And there were in the same country shepherds watching and keeping the <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a> of the night over their flock. And, lo, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord stood by them, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you: You shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, lying in a <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>. And suddenly there was with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> a multitude of the heavenly host praising <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and saying, Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest, and on earth peace to men of goodwill.  And it came to pass, as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and see this thing which has come to pass, which the Lord has made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto us. And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>. And when they had seen it, they understood  the saying which had been told them concerning this child. And all they that heard it, wondered also at those things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them. And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, His name was called Jesus, which was so named of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> before He was conceived in the womb.  And then it proceeds thus:  Behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? For we have seen His star in the east, and have come to worship Him. Now when <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him, In <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> of Jud&aelig;a; for thus it is written by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, And you, <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, in the land of Juda, are not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of you shall come a Governor that shall rule my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Then <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently the time of the star which appeared unto them. And he sent them to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when you have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star which they had seen in the east went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was. And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. And when they had come into the house, they found  the child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshipped Him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto Him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh. And being warned of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> that they should not return unto <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, they departed into their own country another way.  Then, after this account of their return, the narrative goes on thus:  When the days of her (His mother's) purification, according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, were accomplished, they brought Him to Jerusalem, to present Him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that opens the womb shall be called <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to the Lord), and to offer a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons. And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was in him.</p>

<p>And it had been revealed unto him  by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. And he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> brought in the child Jesus, to do for Him after the custom  of the law, then took he Him up in his arms, and said, Lord, now let Your servant depart in peace, according to Your word: for my eyes have seen Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which You have prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Your people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And His father and mother  marvelled at those things which were spoken of Him. And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary His mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and for a sign that shall be spoken against; and a sword shall pierce through your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with her husband seven years from her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>; and she was a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> day and night. And she, coming in that instant, gave thanks  also unto the Lord, and spoke of Him to all them that looked for the redemption of Jerusalem.  And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord,  behold,  the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, saying, Arise, and take the young child and His mother, and flee into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and be there until I bring you word; for <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> will seek the young child to destroy Him. When he arose, he took the young child and His mother by night, and departed into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and was there until the death of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, Out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> have I called my Son. Then <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation and great mourning,  Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not. But when <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> was dead, behold, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord appeared in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> to Joseph in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, saying, Arise, and take the young child and His mother, and go into the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; for they are dead which sought the young child's life. And he arose, and took the young child and His mother, and came into the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Jud&aelig;a, in the room of his father <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, he was afraid to go there; and being warned of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, he turned aside into the parts of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>; and came and dwelt in a city called <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, He shall be called a Nazarene.  And  the child grew, and waxed strong, filled with wisdom; and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God was in Him. And His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> went to Jerusalem every year, at the feast of the passover. And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem, after the custom of the feast. And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>  <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not of it. But they, supposing Him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought Him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. And when they found Him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem seeking Him. And it came to pass, that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions. And all that heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers. And when they saw Him, they were amazed. And His mother said to Him, Son, why have you thus dealt with us? Behold, your father and I sought you sorrowing. And He said unto them, How is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be about my Father's business?  And they understood not the saying which He spoke unto them. And He went down with them, and came to <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, and was subject unto them; and His mother kept all these sayings in her heart.  And Jesus increased in wisdom and age,  and in favour with God and men. </p>
