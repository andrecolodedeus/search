<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book II</h1>

<h2>Chapter 50. Of the Occasion on Which He Fed the Multitudes with the Seven Loaves, and of the Question as to the Harmony Between Matthew and Mark in Their Accounts of that Miracle.</h2>

<p>104. Matthew proceeds with his narrative in the following terms: <q>And when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had departed from thence, He came near unto the sea of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. And great multitudes came unto Him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet, and He healed them; insomuch that the multitudes wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Then Jesus called His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> unto Him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat,</q> and so on, down to the words, <q>And they that did eat were four thousand men, besides <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children.</q>  This other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the seven loaves and the few little fishes is recorded also by Mark, and that too in almost the same order; the exception being that he inserts before it a narrative given by no other&mdash;namely, that relating to the deaf man whose ears the Lord opened, when He spat and said, <q>Effeta,</q> that is, Be opened. </p>

<p>105. In the case of this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the seven loaves, it is certainly not a superfluous task to call attention to the fact that these two <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, Matthew and Mark, have thus introduced it into their narrative. For if one of them had recorded this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, who at the same time had taken no notice of the instance of the five loaves, he would have been judged to stand opposed to the rest. For in such circumstances, who would not have supposed that there was only the one <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> wrought in actual fact, and that an incomplete and unveracious version of it had been given by the writer referred to, or by the others, or by all of them together; so [that we must have imagined] either that the one <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, by a mistake on his own part, had been led to mention seven loaves instead of five; or that the other two, whether as having both presented an incorrect statement, or as having been misled through a slip of memory, had put the number five for the number seven. In like manner, it might have been supposed that there was a contradiction between the twelve baskets  and the seven baskets,  and again, between the five thousand and the four thousand, expressing the numbers of those who were fed. But now, since those <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> who have given us the account of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the seven loaves have also not failed to mention the other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the five loaves, no difficulty can be felt by any one, and all can see that both works were really wrought. This, accordingly, we have instanced, in order that, if in any other passage we come upon some similar deed of the Lord's, which, as told by one <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, seems so utterly contrary to the version of it given by another that no method of solving the difficulty can possibly be found, we may understand the explanation to be simply this, that both incidents really took place, and that they were recorded separately by the two several writers. This is precisely what we have already recommended to attention in the matter of the seating of the multitudes by hundreds and by fifties. For were it not for the circumstance that both these numbers are found noted by the one historian, we might have supposed that the different writers had made contradictory statements. </p>
