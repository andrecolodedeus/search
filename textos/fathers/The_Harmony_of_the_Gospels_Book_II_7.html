<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book II</h1>

<h2>Chapter 7. Of the Two Herods.</h2>

<p>20. But with respect to the mention of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, it is well understood that some are apt to be influenced by the circumstance that Luke has told us how, in the days of John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, and at the time when the Lord, being then a grown man, was also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> was tetrarch of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>;  whereas Matthew tells us that the boy  Jesus returned from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> after the death of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>. Now these two accounts cannot both be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, unless we may also suppose that there were two different Herods. But as no one can fail to be aware that this is a perfectly possible case, what must be the blindness in which those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> pursue their mad follies, who are so quick to launch false charges against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>; and how miserably inconsiderate must they be, not to reflect that two men may have been called by the same name? Yet this is a thing of which examples abound on all sides. For this latter <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> is understood to have been the son of the former <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>: just as Archelaus also was, whom Matthew states to have succeeded to the throne of Jud&aelig;a on the death of his father; and as Philip was, who is introduced by Luke as the brother of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> the tetrarch, and as himself tetrarch of Itur&aelig;a. For the <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> who sought the life of the child Christ was king; whereas this other <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, his son, was not called king, but tetrarch, which is a Greek word, signifying etymologically one set over the fourth part of a kingdom.</p>
