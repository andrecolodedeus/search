<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book II</h1>

<h2>Chapter 71. Of the Marriage of the King's Son, to Which the Multitudes Were Invited; And of the Order in Which Matthew Introduces that Section as Compared with Luke, Who Gives Us a Somewhat Similar Narrative in Another Connection.</h2>

<p>139. Matthew goes on as follows: <q>And when the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> had heard His <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, they perceived that He spoke of them: and when they sought to lay hands on Him, they feared the multitude, because they took Him for a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. And Jesus answered and spoke unto them again by <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, and said, The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is like a certain king which made a marriage for his son, and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding, and they would not come;</q> and so on, down to the words, <q>For many are called, but few are chosen.</q>  This <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> concerning the guests who were invited to the wedding is related only by Matthew. Luke also records something which resembles it. But that is really a different passage, as the order itself sufficiently indicates, although there is some similarity between the two.  The matters introduced, however, by Matthew immediately after the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> concerning the vineyard, and the killing of the son of the head of the house&mdash;namely, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews'</a> perception that this whole discourse was directed against them, and their beginning to contrive treacherous schemes against Him&mdash;are attested likewise by Mark and Luke, who also keep the same order in inserting them.  But after this paragraph they proceed to another subject, and immediately subjoin a passage which Matthew has also indeed introduced in due order, but only subsequently to this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the marriage, which he alone has put on record here.</p>
