<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book IV</h1>

<h2>Chapter 6. Of the Circumstance that Mark Has Recorded More Than Luke as Spoken by the Lord in Connection with the Case of This Man Who Was Casting Out Devils in the Name of Christ, Although He Was Not Following with the Disciples; And of the Question How These Additional Words Can Be Shown to Have a Real Bearing Upon What Christ Had in View in Forbidding the Individual to Be Interdicted Who Was Performing Miracles in His Name.</h2>

<p>7. Mark proceeds with his narrative in these terms: <q>For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward. And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. And if your hand offend you, cut it off: it is better for you to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, into the fire that never shall be quenched; where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.</q> And so on, down to where it is said, <q>Have <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> in yourselves, and have peace one with another.</q>  These words Mark represents to have been spoken by the Lord in the connection immediately following what He said in forbidding the man to be interdicted who was casting out devils in His name, and yet was not following Him along with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. In this section, too, he introduces some matters which are not found in any of the other <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, but also some which occur in Matthew as well, and some which we come across in like manner both in Matthew and in Luke. Those other <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, however, bring in these matters in different connections, and in another order of facts, and not at this particular point when the statement was made to Christ about the man who did not follow Him along with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and yet was casting out devils in His name. My opinion, therefore, is, that the Lord did really utter sayings in this connection, according to Mark's attestation, of which he also delivered Himself on other occasions, and this for the simple reason, that they were sufficiently pertinent to this expression of His mind which he gave here, when He forbade the placing of any interdict upon the working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in His name, even although that should be done by a man who did not follow Him along with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. For Mark presents the relation of the one passage to the other thus: <q>For he that is not against us is on our part; for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.</q> This makes it plain that even this man, whose case John had taken up, and thus had given occasion for the Lord to commence the discourse referred to, was not separating himself from the society of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to any such effect as to scorn it like a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. But his position was something parallel to the familiar one of men who, while not going the length yet of receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nevertheless favour the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name so far as even to receive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and accommodate themselves to them for this very reason, and none other, that they are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; of which type of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> it is that He tells us that they do not lose their reward. This does not mean, however, that they ought at once to think themselves quite safe and secure simply on account of this kindness which they cherish towards <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, while at the same time they are neither cleansed by Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, nor incorporated into the unity of His body. But the import is, that they are now being guided by the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in such a way that they may also come to these higher things,  and so quit this present world in safety. And such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> assuredly are more profitable [servants], even before they become associated with the number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, than those individuals who, while already bearing the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name and partaking in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, recommend courses which are only fitted to drag others, whom they may persuade to adopt them, along with themselves into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment. These are the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom He refers under the figure of the members of the body, and whom He commands to be cast out from the body, like an offending hand or eye; that is to say, to be cut off from the fellowship of that unity, in order that they should seek rather to enter into life without such associates, than to go into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> in their company. Moreover, they are separated from those from whom they separate themselves, just when no consent is yielded to their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> recommendations, that is to say, to the offenses in which they indulge. And if, indeed, they are discovered in the character of their perversity to all good men with whom they have any fellowship,  they are cut off completely from the fellowship of all, and also from participation in the divine <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. But if they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in this character only to some, while their perversity is unknown to the majority, they must just be borne with, as the chaff is endured in the thrashing-floor previous to the winnowing; that is to say, they must be dealt with in a manner which will neither involve any agreement with them in the fellowship of unrighteousness, nor lead to a forsaking of the society of the good on their account. This is what is done by those who have <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> in themselves, and who have peace one with another.</p>
