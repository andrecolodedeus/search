<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book IV</h1>

<h2>Chapter 7. Of the Fact that from This Point on to the Lord's Supper, with Which Act the Discussion of All the Narratives of the Four Evangelists Conjointly Commenced, No Question Calling for Special Examination is Raised by Mark's Gospel.</h2>

<p>8. Mark continues as follows: <q>And He arose from thence, and comes into the coasts of Jud&aelig;a by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto Him again; and, as He was wont, He taught them again;</q> and so on, down to where it is said, <q>For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.</q>  In this entire context, all the above has been subjected to investigation already, with the view of removing the appearance of any contrariety, when we were comparing the other <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> in due order with Matthew. This narrative, however, of the poor <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who cast two mites into the treasury is reported only by two of them, namely, Mark and Luke.  But their harmony admits of no question. And from this point onwards to the Lord's Supper, which latter act formed the starting-point for our discussion of all the records of the four <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> taken conjointly, Mark introduces nothing of a kind to make it necessary for us to institute a special comparison between it and any other statement, or to conduct an inquiry with the view of dispelling any appearance of discrepancy.</p>
