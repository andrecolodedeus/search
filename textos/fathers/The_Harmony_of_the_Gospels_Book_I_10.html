<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book I</h1>

<h2>Chapter 11. In Opposition to Those Who Foolishly Imagine that Christ Converted the People to Himself by Magical Arts.</h2>

<p>17. Moreover, let those who madly fancy that it was by the use of magical arts that He was able to do the great things which He did, and that it was by the practice of such <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> that He made His name a sacred thing to the peoples who were to be converted to Him, give their attention to this question&mdash;namely, whether by the exercise of magical arts, and before He was born on this earth, He could also have filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> those mighty <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who aforetime declared those very things concerning Him as things destined to come to pass, which we can now read in their accomplishment in the gospel, and which we can see in their present realization in the world. For surely, even if it was by magical arts that He secured worship for Himself, and that, too, after His death, it is not the case that He was a magician before He was born. Nay, for the office of prophesying on the subject of His coming, one nation had been most specially deputed; and the entire administration of that commonwealth was ordained to be a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of this King who was to come, and who was to found a heavenly state  drawn out of all nations.</p>
