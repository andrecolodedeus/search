<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book I</h1>

<h2>Chapter 17. In Opposition to the Romans Who Rejected the God of Israel Alone.</h2>

<p>25. However, here is a matter which should meet with more careful consideration at their hands&mdash;namely, what they take the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to be, and why they have not admitted Him to the honours of worship among them, in the way that they have done with the gods of other nations that have been made subject to the imperial power of Rome? This question demands an answer all the more, when we see that they are of the mind that all the gods ought to be worshipped by the man of wisdom. Why, then, has He been excluded from the number of these others? If He is very mighty, why is He the only deity that is not worshipped by them? If He has little or no might, why are the images of other gods broken in pieces by all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, while He is now almost the only God that is worshipped among these peoples? From the grasp of this question these men shall never be able to extricate themselves, who worship both the greater and the lesser deities, whom they hold to be gods, and at the same time refuse to worship this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> Himself stronger than all those to whom they do service. If He is [a God] of great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>,  why has He been deemed worthy only of rejection? And if He is [a God] of little or no power, why has He been able to accomplish so much, although rejected? If He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, why is He the only one separated from the other good deities? And if He is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, why is He, who stands thus alone, not subjugated by so many good deities? If He is truthful, why are His precepts scorned? And if He is a liar, why are His predictions fulfilled?</p>
