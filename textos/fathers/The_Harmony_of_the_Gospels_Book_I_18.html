<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book I</h1>

<h2>Chapter 19. The Proof that This God is the True God.</h2>

<p>27. But that must have been a vain necessity and a ridiculous timidity.  We ask now what opinion regarding this God is formed by those men whose pleasure it is that all gods ought to be worshipped. For if He ought not to be worshipped, how are all worshipped when He is not worshipped? And if He ought to be worshipped, it cannot be that all others are to be worshipped along with Him. For unless He is worshipped alone, He is really not worshipped at all. Or may it perhaps be the case, that they will allege Him to be no God at all, while they call those gods who, as we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, have no power to do anything except so far as permission is given them by His judgment,&mdash; have not merely no power to do good to any one, but no power even to do harm to any, except to those who are judged by Him, who possesses all power, to merit so to be harmed? But, as they themselves are compelled to admit, those deities have shown less power than He has done. For if those are held to be gods whose <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, when consulted by men, have returned responses which, that I may not call them false, were at least most convenient for their private interests, how is not He to be regarded as God whose <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have not only given the congruous answer on subjects regarding which they were consulted at the special time, but who also, in the case of subjects respecting which they were not consulted, and which related to the universal race of man and all nations, have announced <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> so long time before the event those very things of which we now read, and which indeed we now behold? If they gave the name of god to that being under whose inspiration the Sibyl sung of the fates  of the Romans, how is not He (to be called) <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who, in accordance with the announcement aforetime given, has shown us how the Romans and all nations are coming to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Himself through the gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to demolish all the images of their fathers? Finally, if they designate those as gods who have never dared through their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to say anything against this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how is not He (to be designated) <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who not only commanded by the mouth of His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> the destruction of their images, but who also predicted that among all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> they would be destroyed by those who should be enjoined to abandon their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and to worship Him alone, and who, on receiving these injunctions, should be His servants? </p>
