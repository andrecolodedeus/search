<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book I</h1>

<h2>Chapter 3. Of the Fact that Matthew, Together with Mark, Had Specially in View the Kingly Character of Christ, Whereas Luke Dealt with the Priestly.</h2>

<p>5. For the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who is the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> King and the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Priest, the former to rule us, and the latter to make expiation for us, has shown us how His own figure bore these two parts together, which were only separately commended [to notice] among the Fathers.  This becomes apparent if (for example) we look to that inscription which was affixed to His cross&mdash; <q>King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>:</q> in connection also with which, and by a secret instinct, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> replied, <q>What I have written, I have written.</q>  For it had been said aforetime in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, <q>Destroy not the writing of the title.</q>  The same becomes evident, so far as the part of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is concerned, if we have regard to what He has taught us concerning offering and receiving. For thus it is that He sent us beforehand a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>  respecting Himself, which runs thus, <q>You are a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for ever, after the order of Melchisedek.</q>  And in many other testimonies of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, Christ appears both as King and as Priest. Hence, also, even David himself, whose son He is, not without good reason, more frequently declared to be than he is said to be <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> son, and whom Matthew and Luke have both alike held by&mdash;the one viewing him as the person from whom, through Solomon, His lineage can be traced down, and the other taking him for the person to whom, through Nathan, His genealogy can be carried up&mdash;did represent the part of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, although he was patently a king, when he ate the <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">show-bread</a>. For it was not lawful for any one to eat that, save the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> only.  To this it must be added that Luke is the only one who mentions how Mary was discovered by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and how she was related to <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elisabeth</a>,  who was the wife of Zacharias the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. And of this Zacharias the same <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> has recorded the fact, that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom he had for wife was one of the daughters of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, which is to say she belonged to the tribe of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. </p>

<p>6. Whereas, then, Matthew had in view the kingly character, and Luke the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a>, they have at the same time both set forth pre-eminently the humanity of Christ: for it was according to His humanity that Christ was made both King and Priest. To Him, too, God gave the throne of His father David, in order that of His kingdom there should be none end.  And this was done with the purpose that there might be a mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,  to make intercession for us. Luke, on the other hand, had no one connected with him to act as his summarist in the way that Mark was attached to Matthew. And it may be that this is not without a certain solemn significance.  For it is the right of kings not to miss the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> following of attendants; and hence the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, who had taken it in hand to give an account of the kingly character of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, had a person attached to him as his associate who was in some fashion to follow in his steps. But inasmuch as it was the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> want to enter all alone into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies, in accordance with that principle, Luke, whose object contemplated the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, did not have any one to come after him as a confederate, who was meant in some way to serve as an epitomizer of his narrative. </p>
