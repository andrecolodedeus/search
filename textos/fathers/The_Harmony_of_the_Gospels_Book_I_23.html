<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book I</h1>

<h2>Chapter 24. Of the Fact that Those Persons Who Reject the God of Israel, in Consequence Fail to Worship All the Gods; And, on the Other Hand, that Those Who Worship Other Gods, Fail to Worship Him.</h2>

<p>37. It is well understood, therefore, what these worshippers of images are convicted in reality of revering, and what they attempt to colour over.  But even these new interpreters of Saturn must be required to tell us what they think of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the Hebrews. For to them also it seemed right to worship all the gods, as is done by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> nations, because their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> made them ashamed to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> themselves under Christ for the remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. What opinion, therefore, do they entertain regarding the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? For if they do not worship Him then they do not worship all gods; and if they do worship Him, they do not worship Him in the way that He has ordained for His own worship, because they worship others also whose worship He has interdicted. Against such practices He issued His prohibition by the mouth of those same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> by whom He also announced beforehand the destined occurrence of those very things which their images are now sustaining at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. For whatever the explanation may be, whether it be that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were sent to those <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to show them figuratively, and by the congruous forms of visible objects, the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Creator of all things, to whom the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is made subject, and to indicate the method in which He enjoined His own worship to proceed; or whether it was that the minds of some among them were so mightily elevated by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as to enable them to see those things in that kind of vision in which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> themselves behold objects: in either case it is the incontestable fact, that they did serve that God who has prohibited the worship of other gods; and, moreover, it is equally certain, that with the faithfulness of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, in the kingly and in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office, they ministered at once for the good of their country, and in the interest of those sacred ordinances which were significant of the coming of Christ as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> King and Priest.</p>
