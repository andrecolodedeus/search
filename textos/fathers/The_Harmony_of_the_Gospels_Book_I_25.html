<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book I</h1>

<h2>Chapter 26. Of the Fact that Idolatry Has Been Subverted by the Name of Christ, and by the Faith of Christians According to the Prophecies.</h2>

<p>40. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> what is thus effected by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> is not a thing which belongs only to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> times, but one which was predicted very long ago. Those very <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who have remained enemies to the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and regarding whose destined perfidy these prophetic writings have not been silent, do themselves possess and peruse the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> who says: <q>O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and my refuge in the day of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> shall come unto You from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have worshipped mendacious <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and there is no profit in them.</q>  Behold, that is now being done; behold, now the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are coming from the ends of the earth to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, uttering things like these, and breaking their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>! Of signal consequence, too, is this which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has done for His Church in its world-wide extension, in that the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation, which has been deservedly overthrown and scattered abroad throughout the lands, has been made to carry about with it everywhere the records of our prophecies, so that it might not be possible to look upon these predictions as concocted by ourselves; and thus the enemy of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has been made a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. How, then, can it be possible that the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Christ have taught what they have not learned from Christ, as those foolish men in their silly fancies object, with the view of getting the superstitious worship of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> gods and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> subverted? Can it be said also that those prophecies which are still read in these days, in the books of the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, were the inventions of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Christ?</p>

<p>41. Who, then, has effected the demolition of these systems but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? For to this people was the announcement made by those divine voices which were addressed to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; the Lord your God is one God.</q>  <q>You shall not make unto you any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath.</q>  And again, in order that this people  might put an end to these things wherever it received power to do so, this commandment was also laid upon the nation: <q>You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them; you shall not do after their works, but you shall utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.</q>  But who shall say that Christ and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> have no connection with <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, seeing that <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was the grandson of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, to whom first, as afterwards to his son Isaac, and then to his grandson <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> himself, that promise was given, which I have already mentioned, namely: <q>In your seed shall all nations be blessed</q>? That prediction we see now in its fulfilment in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For it was of this line that the Virgin was born, concerning whom a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> sang in these terms: <q>Behold, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> shall conceive, and bear a son; and they shall call  His name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>.</q> For by interpretation, <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a> means, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with us.</q>  This God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, therefore, who has interdicted the worship of other gods, who has interdicted the making of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, who has commanded their destruction, who by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has predicted that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> from the ends of the earth would say, <q>Surely our fathers have worshipped mendacious <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, in which there is no profit;</q> this same God is He who, by the name of Christ and by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, has ordered, promised, and exhibited the overthrow of all these <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a>. In vain, therefore, do these unhappy men, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that they have been prohibited from <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even by their own gods, that is to say, by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, seek to make it out, that this kind of doctrine is something strange to Him, in the power of which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> dispute against <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and root out all those false <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a>, wherever they have the opportunity.</p>
