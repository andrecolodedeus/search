<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book I</h1>

<h2>Chapter 27. An Argument Urging It Upon the Remnant of Idolaters that They Should at Length Become Servants of This True God, Who Everywhere is Subverting Idols.</h2>

<p>42. Let them now give their answer with respect to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, to whom, as teaching and enjoining such things, <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is borne not only by the books of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but also by those of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Regarding Him, let them ask the counsel of their own deities, who have prevented the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Concerning the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, let them give a contumelious response if they dare. But whom are they to consult? Or where are they to ask counsel now? Let them peruse the books of their own authorities. If they consider the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to be Jupiter, as Varro has written (that I may speak for the time being in accordance with their own way of thinking), why then do they not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> are to be destroyed by Jupiter? If they deem Him to be Saturn,  why do they not worship Him? Or why do they not worship Him in that manner in which, by the voice of those <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> through whom He has made good the things which He has foretold, He has ordained His worship to be conducted? Why do they not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that images are to be destroyed by Him, and the worship of other gods forbidden? If He is neither Jove nor Saturn (and surely, if He were one of these, He would not speak out so mightily against the sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of their Jove and Saturn), who then is this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who, with all their consideration for other gods, is the only Deity not worshipped by them, and who, nevertheless, so manifestly brings it about that He shall Himself be the sole object of worship, to the overthrow of all other gods, and to the humiliation of everything <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and highly exalted, which has lifted itself up against Christ in behalf of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> and slaying <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? But, in good <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, men are now asking into what secret recesses these worshippers withdraw, when they are minded to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>; or into what regions of obscurity they thrust back these same gods of theirs, to prevent their being discovered and broken in pieces by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Whence comes this mode of dealing, if not from the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and those rulers by whose instrumentality the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> discovers His power, and who are now made subject to the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And that it should be so He promised long ago, when He said by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Yea, all kings of the earth shall worship Him: all nations shall serve Him.</q> </p>
