<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book I</h1>

<h2>Chapter 28. Of the Predicted Rejection of Idols.</h2>

<p>43. It cannot be questioned that what was predicted at sundry times by His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> is now being realized&mdash;namely, the announcement that He would disclaim His impious people (not, indeed, the people as a whole, because even of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> many have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Christ; for His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves belonged to that nation), and would <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> every <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and injurious person, so that He should Himself alone be exalted, that is to say, alone be manifested to men as lofty and mighty; until <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> should be cast away by those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and be concealed by those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not; when the earth is broken by His <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, that is to say, when the men of earth are subdued by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, to wit, by fearing His law, or the law of those who, being at once <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in His name and rulers among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, shall interdict such <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> practices.</p>

<p>44. For these things, which I have thus briefly stated in the way of introduction, and with a view to their readier apprehension, are thus expressed by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: And now, O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord. For He has disclaimed His people the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because the country was replenished, as from the beginning, with their soothsayings as with those of strangers, and many strange children were born to them. For their country was replenished with silver and gold, neither was there any numbering of their treasures; their land also is full of horses, neither was there any numbering of their chariots: their land also is full of the abominations of the works of their own hands, and they have worshipped that which their own fingers have made. And the mean man  has bowed himself, and the great man  has humbled himself; and I will not forgive it them. And now enter ye into the rocks, and hide yourselves in the earth from before the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, and from the majesty of His power, when He arises to crush the earth: for the eyes of the Lord are lofty, and man is low; and the haughtiness of men shall be humbled, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. For the day of the Lord of Hosts shall be upon every one that is injurious and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and upon every one that is lifted up and humbled,  and they shall be brought low; and upon every cedar of Lebanon of the high ones and the lifted up,  and upon every tree of the Lebanon of Bashan,  and upon every mountain, and upon every high hill,  and upon every ship of the sea, and upon every spectacle of the beauty of ships. And the contumely of men shall be humbled and shall fall, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day;  and all things made by hands they shall hide in dens, and in holes of the rocks, and in caves of the earth, from before the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, and from the majesty of His power, when He arises to crush the earth: for in that day a man shall cast away the abominations of gold and silver, the vain and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things which they made for worship, in order to go into the clefts of the solid rock, and into the holes of the rocks, from before the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, and from the majesty of His power, when He arises to break the earth in pieces. </p>
