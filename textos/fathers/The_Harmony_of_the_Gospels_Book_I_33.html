<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book I</h1>

<h2>Chapter 34. Epilogue to the Preceding.</h2>

<p>52. Much more might I say on this subject, were it not that the requirements of the task which I have undertaken compel me to conclude this book, and revert to the object originally proposed. When, indeed, I took it in hand to solve those problems of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> which meet us where the four <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, as it seems to certain critics, fail to harmonize with each other, by setting forth to the best of my ability the particular designs which they severally have in view, I was met first by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of discussing a question which some are accustomed to bring before us&mdash;the question, namely, as to the reason why we cannot produce any writings composed by Christ Himself. For their aim is to get Him credited with the writing of some other composition, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not of what sort, which may be suitable to their inclinations, and with having indulged in no sentiments of antagonism to their gods, but rather with having paid respect to them in a kind of magical worship; and their wish is also to get it <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> not only gave a false account of Him when they declared Him to be the God by whom all things were made, while He was really nothing more than a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, although certainly a man of the most exalted wisdom, but also that they taught with regard to these gods of theirs something different from what they had themselves learned from Him. This is how it happens that we have been engaged preferentially in pressing them with arguments concerning the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who is now worshipped by all nations through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who is also subverting their <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> vanities the whole world over, exactly as He announced by the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> so long ago, and who has now fulfilled those predictions by the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in whom He had promised that all nations should be blessed. And from all this they ought to understand that Christ could neither have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> nor taught anything else with regard to their gods than what was enjoined and foretold by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> through the agency of these <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of His by whom He promised, and ultimately sent, this very Christ, in whose name, according to the promise given to the fathers, when all nations were pronounced blessed, it has come to pass that this same God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> should be called the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the whole earth. By this, too, they ought to see that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> did not depart from the doctrine of their Master when they forbade the worship of the gods of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, with the view of preventing us from addressing our supplications to insensate images, or from having fellowship with <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, or from serving the creature rather than the Creator with the homage of religious worship.</p>
