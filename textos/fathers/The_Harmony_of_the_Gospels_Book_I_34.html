<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book I</h1>

<h2>Chapter 35. Of the Fact that the Mystery of a Mediator Was Made Known to Those Who Lived in Ancient Times by the Agency of Prophecy, as It is Now Declared to Us in the Gospel.</h2>

<p>53. Wherefore, seeing that Christ Himself is that Wisdom of God by whom all things were created, and considering that no rational intelligences, whether of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, receive wisdom except by participation in this Wisdom wherewith we are united by that <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> through whom charity is shed abroad in our hearts  (which Trinity at the same time constitutes one God), <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, having respect to the interests of mortal men whose time-bound life was held engaged in things which rise into being and die,  decreed that this same Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, assuming into the unity of His person the (nature of) man, in which He might be born according to the conditions of time, and live and die and rise again, should utter and perform and bear and sustain things congruous to our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and thus, in exemplary fashion, show at once to men on earth the way for a return to heaven, and to those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who are above us, the way to retain their position in heaven.  For unless, also, in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and under the conditions of an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in time, something came newly into being&mdash;that is to say, unless that began to be which previously was not&mdash;there could never be any passing from a life of utter corruption and folly into one of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> goodness. And thus, as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the contemplative lives in the enjoyment of things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, while <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the believing is what is due to things which are made, man is purified through that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is conversant with temporal things, in order to his being made capable of receiving the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. For one of their noblest intellects, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, in the treatise which is named the <em>Tim&aelig;us</em>, speaks also to this effect: <q>As <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is to that which is made, so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> Those two belong to the things above&mdash;namely, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; these two belong to the things below&mdash;namely, that which is made and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In order, therefore, that we may be called off from the lowest objects, and led up again to the highest, and in order also that what is made may attain to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, we must come through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And because all contraries are reduced to unity by some middle factor, and because also the iniquity of time alienated us from the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, there was need of some mediatorial righteousness of a temporal nature; which mediatizing factor might be temporal on the side of those lowest objects, but also righteous on the side of these highest,  and thus, by adapting itself to the former without cutting itself off from the latter, might bring back those lowest objects to the highest. Accordingly, Christ was named the Mediator between God and men, who stood between the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> God and mortal man, as being Himself both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,  who reconciled man to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who continued to be what He (formerly) was, but was made also what He (formerly) was not. And the same Person is for us at once the (centre of the) said <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in things that are made, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>

<p>54. This great and unutterable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, this kingdom and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, was revealed by <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> to the men of ancient time, and is now preached by the gospel to their descendants. For it behooved that, at some period or other, that should be made good among all nations which for a long time had been promised through the medium of a single nation. Accordingly, He who sent the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> before His own descent also dispatched the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> after His ascension. Moreover, in virtue of the man  assumed by Him, He stands to all His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in the relation of the head to the members of His body. Therefore, when those <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> have written matters which He declared and spoke to them, it ought not by any means to be said that He has written nothing Himself; since the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, that His members have accomplished only what they became acquainted with by the repeated statements of the Head. For all that He was minded to give for our perusal on the subject of His own doings and sayings, He commanded to be written by those <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, whom He thus used as if they were His own hands. Whoever apprehends this correspondence of unity and this concordant service of the members, all in harmony in the discharge of diverse offices under the Head, will receive the account which he gets in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> through the narratives constructed by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, in the same kind of spirit in which he might look upon the actual hand of the Lord Himself, which He bore in that body which was made His own, were he to see it engaged in the act of writing. For this reason let us now rather proceed to examine into the real character of those passages in which these critics suppose the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> to have given contradictory accounts (a thing which only those who fail to understand the matter aright can fancy to be the case); so that, when these problems are solved, it may also be made apparent that the members in that body have preserved a befitting harmony in the unity of the body itself, not only by identity in sentiment, but also by constructing records consonant with that identity.</p>
