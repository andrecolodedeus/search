<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book I</h1>

<h2>Chapter 5. Concerning the Two Virtues, of Which John is Conversant with the Contemplative, the Other Evangelists with the Active.</h2>

<p>8. Moreover, there are two several <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> (or talents) which have been proposed to the mind of man. Of these, the one is the active, and the other the contemplative: the one being that whereby the way is taken, and the other that whereby the goal is reached;  the one that by which men labour in order that the heart may be purified to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the other that by which men are disengaged  and God is seen. Thus the former of these two <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is occupied with the precepts for the right exercise of the temporal life, whereas the latter deals with the doctrine of that life which is everlasting. In this way, also, the one operates, the other rests; for the former finds its sphere in the purging of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the latter moves in the light  of the purged. And thus, again, in this mortal life the one is engaged with the work of a good conversation; while the other subsists rather on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and is seen only in the person of the very few, and through the glass darkly, and only in part in a kind of vision of the unchangeable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.  Now these two <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are understood to be presented emblematically in the instance of the two wives of Jacob. Of these I have discoursed already up to the measure of my ability, and as fully as seemed to be appropriate to my task, (in what I have written) in opposition to Faustus the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a>.  For Lia, indeed, by interpretation means <q>labouring,</q>  whereas Rachel signifies <q>the first principle seen.</q>  And by this it is given us to understand, if one will only attend carefully to the matter, that those three <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> who, with pre-eminent fullness, have handled the account of the Lord's temporal doings and those of His sayings which were meant to bear chiefly upon the moulding of the manners of the present life, were conversant with that active <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and that John, on the other hand, who narrates fewer by far of the Lord's doings, but records with greater carefulness and with larger <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of detail the words which He spoke, and most especially those discourses which were intended to introduce us to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the unity of the Trinity and the blessedness of the life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, formed his plan and framed his statement with a view to commend the contemplative <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to our regard.</p>
