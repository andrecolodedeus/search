<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book I</h1>

<h2>Chapter 7. A Statement of Augustine's Reason for Undertaking This Work on the Harmony of the Evangelists, and an Example of the Method in Which He Meets Those Who Allege that Christ Wrote Nothing Himself, and that His Disciples Made an Unwarranted Affirmation in Proclaiming Him to Be God.</h2>

<p>10. Those sacred chariots of the Lord,  however, in which He is borne throughout the earth and brings the peoples under His easy yoke and His light burden, are assailed with <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> charges by certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who, in impious vanity or in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> temerity, think to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">rob</a> of their credit as veracious historians those teachers by whose instrumentality the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> has been disseminated all the world over, and through whose efforts it has yielded fruits so plentiful that unbelievers now scarcely dare so much as to mutter their <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> in private among themselves, kept in check by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and by the devotion of all the peoples. Nevertheless, inasmuch as they still strive by their <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> disputations to keep some from making themselves acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and thus prevent them from becoming <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, while they also endeavour to the utmost of their power to excite agitations among others who have already attained to belief, and thereby give them trouble; and further, as there are some brethren who, without detriment to their own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, have a desire to ascertain what answer can be given to such questions, either for the advantage of their own <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or for the purpose of refuting the vain utterances of their enemies, with the inspiration and help of the Lord our God (and would that it might prove profitable for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of such men), we have undertaken in this work to demonstrate the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> or the rashness of those who deem themselves able to prefer charges, the subtlety of which is at least sufficiently observable, against those four different books of the gospel which have been written by these four several <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>. And in order to carry out this design to a successful conclusion, we must prove that the writers in question do not stand in any antagonism to each other. For those adversaries are in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of adducing this as the palmary  allegation in all their vain objections, namely, that the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> are not in harmony with each other.</p>

<p>11. But we must first discuss a matter which is apt to present a difficulty to the minds of some. I refer to the question why the Lord has written nothing Himself, and why He has thus left us to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of accepting the testimony of other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have prepared records of His history. For this is what those parties&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> more than any &mdash; allege when they lack boldness enough to impeach or <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself, and when they allow Him&mdash; only as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, however&mdash; to have been possessed of the most distinguished wisdom. In making that admission, they at the same time assert that the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> claimed more for their Master than He really was; so much more indeed that they even called Him the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, by whom all things were made, and affirmed that He and God are one. And in the same way they dispose of all other kindred passages in the epistles of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, in the light of which we have been taught that He is to be worshipped as one God with the Father. For they are of opinion that He is certainly to be honoured as the wisest of men; but they deny that He is to be worshipped as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>12. Wherefore, when they put the question why He has not written in His own person, it would seem as if they were prepared to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> regarding Him whatever He might have written concerning Himself, but not what others may have given the world to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> with respect to His life, according to the measure of their own judgment. Well, I ask them in turn why, in the case of certain of the noblest of their own <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, they have accepted the statements which their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> left in the records they have composed, while these sages themselves have given us no written accounts of their own lives? For Pythagoras, than whom Greece in those days  did not possess any more illustrious personage in the sphere of that contemplative <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have written absolutely nothing, whether on the subject of his own personal history or on any other theme whatsoever. And as to Socrates, to whom, on the other hand, they have adjudged a position of supremacy above all others in that active <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by which the moral life is trained, so that they do not hesitate also to aver that he was even pronounced to be the wisest of men by the testimony of their deity Apollo&mdash;it is indeed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that he handled the fables of &AElig;sop in some few short verses, and thus made use of words and numbers of his own in the task of rendering the themes of another. But this was all. And so far was he from having the desire to write anything himself, that he declared that he had done even so much only because he was constrained by the imperial will of his <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, the noblest of all his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, tells us. That was a work, also, in which he sought to set forth in fair form not so much his own thoughts, as rather the ideas of another. What reasonable ground, therefore, have they for believing, with regard to those sages, all that their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> have committed to record in respect of their history, while at the same time they refuse to credit in the case of Christ what His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> have written on the subject of His life? And all the more may we thus argue, when we see how they admit that all other men have been excelled by Him in the matter of wisdom, although they decline to acknowledge Him to be God. Is it, indeed, the case that those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom they do not hesitate to allow to have been by far His inferiors, have had the faculty of making <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who can be trusted in all that concerns the narrative of their careers, and that He failed in that capacity? But if that is a most absurd statement to venture upon, then in all that belongs to the history of that Person to whom they grant the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of wisdom, they ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not merely what suits their own notions, but what they read in the narratives of those who learned from this sage Himself those various facts which they have left on record on the subject of His life.</p>
