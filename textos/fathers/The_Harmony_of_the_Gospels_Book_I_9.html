<h1>The Harmony of the Gospels, Book I</h1>

<h2>Chapter 10. Of Some Who are Mad Enough to Suppose that the Books Were Inscribed with the Names of Peter and Paul.</h2>

<p>15. Nay more, as by divine judgment, some of those who either <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, or wish to have it <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, that Christ wrote matter of that description, have even wandered so far into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> as to allege that these same books bore on their front, in the form of epistolary superscription, a designation addressed to Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. And it is quite possible that either the enemies of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or certain parties who thought that they might impart to this kind of execrable arts the weight of authority drawn from so <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> a name, may have written things of that nature under the name of Christ and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. But in such most deceitful audacity they have been so utterly blinded as simply to have made themselves fitting objects for laughter, even with young people who as yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature only in boyish fashion, and rank merely in the grade of readers.</p>

<p>16. For when they made up their minds to represent Christ to have written in such strain as that to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, they bethought themselves of those of His followers who might best be taken for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom Christ might most readily be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have written, as the individuals who had kept by Him on the most familiar terms of friendship. And so Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> occurred to them, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, just because in many places they chanced to see these two <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> represented in pictures as both in company with Him.  For Rome, in a specially <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and solemn manner,  commends the merits of Peter and of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, for this reason among others, namely, that they suffered [<a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>] on the same day. Thus to fall most completely into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was the due desert of men who sought for Christ and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> not in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> writings, but on painted walls. Neither is it to be wondered at, that these fiction-limners were misled by the painters.  For throughout the whole period during which Christ lived in our mortal flesh in fellowship with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had never become His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. Only after His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, after His ascension, after the mission of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from heaven, after many <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had been converted and had shown marvellous <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, after the <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoning</a> of Stephen the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> still bore the name Saul, and was grievously <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> those who had become <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, did Christ call that man [by a voice] from heaven, and made him His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> and apostle.  How, then, is it possible that Christ could have written those books which they wish to have it <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that He did write before His death, and which were addressed to Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, as those among His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who had been most intimate with Him, seeing that up to that date <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had not yet become a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of His at all?</p>
