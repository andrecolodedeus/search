<h1>The Life of Xanthippe, Polyxena and Rebecca</h1>

<p>1. When the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> was at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> through the word of the Lord, it happened that a certain servant of a ruler of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with letters of his master's, and heard the word of God from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> golden and beautiful nightingale. This servant being greatly touched, and being unable to remain and be filled with the divine word because he was hastened by the letters, returned into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in great grief, and being unable to show his desire to any one, because his master was an idolater, he was always pained at heart and sighing greatly. Now this servant was honoured and faithful to his masters, and as time went past, the servant fell sick and grew lean of flesh, which his master perceiving said to him, What has happened to you that you are thus fallen together in countenance? The servant said, here is a great pain in my heart, and I can in no way find rest. His master said to him, And what is the pain that cannot receive healing from my chief physician? The servant said, While I was still in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, this pain and its recurring mishap made itself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me. His master said, And do you not know of any who have fallen into this disease and been healed? The servant said, Yes, but where that physician is I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, for I left him in Rome. So many as have been attended by that physician and have gone through the water m his hands, have received healing immediately. His master said, I ought not to grudge to send you yet again to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, if perchance you might obtain healing.</p>

<p>2. And while they spoke thus, behold his mistress, by name Xanthippe, overhearing these words, and learning of the teaching of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, said, What is the name of that physician, and what is the healing to ward off such a disease? The servant said to her, The calling upon a new name, and anointing with oil and washing with water. By this treatment I have seen many that had incurable pains receive healings. As he said this, the images of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> that stood in the house began to be shaken and fall down. And his mistress beckoned to him, saying, Do you see, brother, the images of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> being shaken, how they cannot endure the power of the word? And his master, by name Probus, arose from his mid-day sleep with a very gloomy countenance, for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> had greatly disturbed him, because the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God had come into his house. And he questioned the servant of everything in order, and the servant having been seized by sickness by the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, disclosed to him the life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and Xanthippe was incurable in her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> concerning this teaching. So Probus too was grieved for Xanthippe, because from that time she was wasting herself away with waking and abstinence and other austerities.</p>

<p>3. And Xanthippe going away to her couch and groaning, said, Woe is me, wretched one, lying in darkness, that I have not learned the name of the new teacher, that I might summon his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to help me, and what to say I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. Shall I call upon him by the name of his God? But I cannot say, The God that is preached by such a one. Nevertheless I shall say thus by conjecture, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, giving light in Hades, and guiding those in darkness, Lord of free men and kings, and preached by worthy servants in all the world, called upon as a brother by sinful men and quick to hear, to whom not even archangels can send up worthy songs of praise, who hast shown to me, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and unworthy, the ever-living and abiding seed (though my <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> permits me not to receive it), hasten also the things that concern me, Lord, since by your will you have made yourself heard by me, and in your compassion show me the proclamation of your herald, that I may learn of him what is pleasing to you. Yea, I beseech you look upon my <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and enlighten me with the light of your countenance, you that never overlooks any of those that call upon you in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Probus, her husband said to her, Why do you trouble yourself so much, lady, and turn not at all to sleep? Xanthippe said, I cannot sleep, for there is in me an incurable pain. Probus said to her, And what is your pain or grief, O lady, that I am not sufficient to comfort you? All that you have wished unto this day I have served you in, and now what is it that you have, and do not tell me? Xanthippe says to him, I beseech you this thing only, my lord, permit me for a little and for this day only to sleep apart from you. And Probus said to her, Be it as you will, lady; only leave off your groaning.</p>

<p>4. Then entering into her bed-chamber alone, she spoke thus with tears, In what way, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I shall act, or what counsel I shall take, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. Shall I declare the thought that has come upon me? I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> and disorder of the city. Shall I fly from this impious city? I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the contrivance of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> for seizing the sheep. Shall I await the mercy and swiftness of the Lord? Again I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the untimely snatching away of life, for the death of sinners has no warning. Shall I depart and flee away to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>? I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the length of the journey, being unable to go on foot. But while I say these things by conjecture, constrained by my desire (for I cannot speak with surety), may I find pardon with you, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and fulfil my desire with excess of right words, and think me but worthy to hear your preacher, for if I say, to see his face, I ask a great thing. Blessed is he that is found in the company of your preachers, and is satisfied with their precious countenances. Blessed are they that are yoked under the preaching of your commandments. Blessed are they that keep your commandments; but where now, Lord, are your mercies to our fathers, that we also may be their successors in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> toward you and heirs of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But behold now, Lord, I cannot find any one that has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for you, that communing with him I might even a little refresh my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Speed therefore, Lord, to yoke me in desire for you, and keep me under the shadow of your wings, for you alone are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p>5. Therefore Xanthippe saying these words and others like them, groaned continually all the night, and Probus heard her and was greatly distressed, and arising from his couch when the morning came he went in to her, and seeing her eyes inflamed with tears, he said, Wherefore, lady, do you thus vex me, and will not tell me your pain? Tell it me, that I may do whatever is pleasing to you, and distress me not with your trouble. Xanthippe says to him, Be of good cheer rather, my lord, and be not vexed, for my trouble shall not harm you, but if I have found favour before you, go forth now to the salutation, and allow me to indulge myself in it as I will, for it is not possible for man to take from me the insatiable pain. And listening to her he went out immediately to receive the salutations of the men of the city, for he was the great man among them, and was also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, the Emperor. And sitting down, great grief appeared in his countenance, and being asked the reason of his grief by the chief men of the city, he said to them that he had fallen into many and unfounded charges.</p>

<p>6. And Xanthippe went out into the garden, that she might await there looking closely for certainty of her husband, and she saw the delight of the trees, and the various warbling of the birds, and said, groaning, O beauty of the world! For that which we hitherto thought to come of itself, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> now that all things are beautifully fashioned by the beautiful One. O power and invention of wisdom! For not only has he placed in men a thousand tongues, but also in birds he has distinguished various voices, as if from anthems and responses to receive sweet-voiced and heart-stirring <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> from his own works. O delightfulness of the air, declaring the inimitable creator! Who shall turn my sorrow into rejoicing? And again she said, God to whom praise is sung by all, give me peace and comfort. As she said these things, Probus also came up from the street to break his fast, and when he saw her countenance altered by tears, he began to pull out the hairs of his head, but he dared not speak to her then so as not to mingle other trouble with her trouble. So he went and fell upon his couch, and said, groaning, Alas, that I had not even the consolation of a child from her, but only acquire grief upon grief. Two years are not yet full since I was wedded to her, and already she meditates <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>.</p>

<p>7. But Xanthippe was always keeping watch through the doors into the streets of the city, and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, the preacher and teacher and illuminator of the world, left Rome and came even into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> by the fore-<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And coming up to the gates of the city he stood and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and crossing himself entered the city. When Xanthippe saw the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> walking quietly and equally, and adorned with all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and understanding, she was greatly delighted in him and her heart leaped continually, and as possessed with an unexpected <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> she said with herself, Why does my heart beat vehemently at the sight of this man? Why is his walk quiet and equable, as of one who expects to take in his arms one that is pursued? Why is his countenance kindly, as of one that tends the sick? Why does he look so lovingly hither and there, as one who desires to assist those who are seeking to flee from the mouths of dragons? Who shall tell me that this is one from the flock of preachers? If it were possible for me, I should wish to touch the hem of his garments, that I may behold his kindness and readiness to receive and sweet odour; for the servant had told her this also, that the hems of his garments had the odour of precious perfumes.</p>

<p>8. Now Probus heard her words, and straightway ran out by himself into the street, and laying hold of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> hand said to him, Man, who you are I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, but deign to enter into my house; perchance you may be to me a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said to him, It will be well with you, son, after your request! And they went in together to Xanthippe. When Xanthippe therefore saw the great <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the intellectual eyes of her heart were uncovered, and she read upon his forehead, having as it were golden seals, these words, <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the Preacher of God</span> . Then exulting and rejoicing she threw herself at his feet, and twisting her hair together she wiped his feet, saying, Welcome, O man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to us <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> ones, that live as shadows among shadows. For you have looked upon those who were running into Hades as into something beautiful, who addressed the crooked serpent and destroyer as provider and protector, who were running into the dark Hades as to their father, those that were fashioned with a rational nature but have become like irrational creatures. You have sought me, lowly one, having the sun of righteousness in my heart. Now the poison is stayed, when I have seen your precious face. Now he that troubled me is flown away, when your most beautiful counsel has appeared to me. Now I shall be considered worthy of repentance, when I have received the seal of the preacher of the Lord. Before now I have deemed many <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> who met with you, but I say boldly that from this time forth I myself shall be called <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> by others, because I have touched your hem, because I have received your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, because I have enjoyed your sweet and honeyed teaching. You have not hesitated to come to us, you that fishest the dry land in your course, and gatherest the fish that fall in your way into the net of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</p>

<p>9. The great <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said to her, Arise, daughter, and look not upon me as having been sought out of your <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> by my foresight. For Christ, the provider of the world, the searcher out of sinners and the lost, who has not only called to mind those upon earth, but also by his own presence has redeemed those in Hades, he himself has pitied you, and sent me hither that he might visit and pity many others together with you. For this mercy and visitation are not of us, but are his injunction and command, even as we also have received mercy and been saved by him. Probus hearing this was astonished at their words, for he was altogether <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of these things. But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> by force raised up Xanthippe from his feet, and she running set a new gilded chair for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to sit down upon. The great <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said to her, My daughter Xanthippe, do not thus, for you have not yet accorded to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but wait a little, till the Lord shall set in order what is necessary! Xanthippe said to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, Do you say this to try me, O preacher of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or have you any foreknowledge? <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, No, daughter, but the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sows <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in the hearts of his own servants, to oppose those that labour for Christ in preaching, for his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> has extended to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and even to the Lord himself. Therefore it is fitting to approach the unbelievers gently and kindly! Xanthippe said to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, I beseech you, if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your servants, make <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for Probus, and let me see if he that is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by you can work in him; let me see if he can even stand against your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> rejoiced exceedingly at the words of her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and said to her, Believe me, daughter, that by his suggestion and working I have not passed a single hour without chains and blows. Xanthippe said to him, But you suffer these things by your own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, since you have not neglected your preaching even to scourging, but this again I tell you, that your bonds shall be the defeat of the prompter, and your humiliation their overthrow.</p>

<p>10. Now the report of his presence ran through the whole city and the country round about, for some of that city having been at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had seen the signs and wonders that were done by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, and came to see if this was he. Many therefore came into the house of Probus, and he began to be annoyed and to say, I will not suffer my house to be made an inn. Xanthippe <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the face of Probus had begun to be estranged, and that he spoke thus, was greatly distressed, saying, Alas, wretched me, that we are not thought fully worthy to keep this man in our house; for if <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> goes hence, the church also will be held elsewhere. Then Xanthippe, considering these matters, put her hand on the foot of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and taking dust she called Probus to her, and placing her hand on his breast said, O Lord, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who hast sought out me, lowly one and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of you, send what is fitting into this heart. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> perceived her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and made the sign of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and for several days the people entered unhindered, and as many as had sick and vexed by unclean spirits brought them, and all were healed.</p>

<p>11. And Xanthippe said to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, Teacher, my heart is greatly consumed because I have not as yet received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And after this Probus being again moved by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, cast <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> out of the house and shut up Xanthippe in her chamber. Then one of the chief men, Philotheus by name, besought the great <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to come into his house, but the great <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was unwilling to do so, saying, Lest Probus trouble your house on my account. Philotheus said to him, Nay, father, I am not at all subject to him, for in no other thing is he greater than me, except in rank, and that because the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of Xanthippe are above me. But if Probus come to me, I am above him in riches and in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the great apostle of the Lord, was persuaded, and went into the house of Philotheus the ex-prefect. All this was done by the Evil one that Xanthippe might receive <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> with tribulation, and be faint-hearted concerning the commandments of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>12. Xanthippe therefore, with tears, said to her servants, Have you learned where <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is gone to? They said, Yea, in the house of Philotheus the ex-prefect, and Xanthippe rejoiced greatly that Philotheus also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, being able, as she said, to persuade Probus also. Then Probus called Xanthippe to supper, and when she consented not, Probus said, Think not that in bed also you will keep away from me. But when he lay down to supper, Xanthippe bending her knees, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the Lord, saying, Eternal and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that took dust from the ground, and did not value it according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of its creation, but called it the son of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, you who came from the heart of the father to the heart of the earth for our sake, on whom the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> dare not fix their gaze, and for us wast hidden in the womb that by taking up your abode in a mother you might make good the offense of Eve. You that drank gall and vinegar, and wast pierced in the side by a spear, that you might heal the wound given by the rib to Adam. For Eve being his rib wrought a blow for Adam, and through him for all the world. You that gave a sleep without perception to the serpent, so that he might not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your Incarnation, remember also my groaning and tears, and grant fulfilment to my sleep,  and bring sleep upon Probus until I shall be deemed worthy of the gift of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, for I vehemently desire to obtain this, to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and praise of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name.</p>

<p>13. But Probus, while still at supper, commanded the doors of their house to be secured by cruel and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> soldiers, and having given these orders, he straightway fell asleep upon the couch. Then the servants came and announced this to Xanthippe that he might be awakened, but she said, Put out the lights, my children, and leave him thus. And in the first sleep, taking three hundred pieces of gold, she went to the doors, saying with herself, Perchance the porter will be persuaded by the amount of money. But he, being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and froward, would not be persuaded to do this, and she, loosing also her girdle, which was set with precious stones and worth two hundred pieces of gold, gave it to him and went out saying, Lord, I win over my own slaves with money, that your preacher <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> may not be oppressed by Probus. And Xanthippe went on to the house of Philotheus the ex-prefect, as to a great and incredible work, running and praising God. As she therefore passed through a certain place, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> pursued her with fiery torches and lightnings, and she, turning, saw behind her this terrible sight, and being possessed with great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> said, What has happened to you now, wretched <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? You have been deprived of your desire. You were running to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, you were running to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and you have fallen into the serpent and his ministers, and these things your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have prepared for you. Speaking thus she was even fainting at heart from great despair, but the great <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> being forewarned by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the assault of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, immediately stood beside her, being also preceded by a beautiful youth. And straightway the vision of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> disappeared, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said to her, Arise, daughter Xanthippe, and behold the Lord desired by you, by whose flame the heavens are shaken and the deep is dried up, coming to you and pitying and saving you. Behold him that accepts your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and straightway gives ear. See him coming in the shape of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> against the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Then she rising from the ground said to him, Master, why have you left me solitary? Even now make haste to seal me, so that if death come upon me I may depart to him who is full of compassion and has no arrogance.</p>

<p>14. Therefore the great <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> straightway taking her hand, went into the house of Philotheus, and baptised her in the name of the Father and of the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Then taking bread also he gave her the eucharist saying, Let this be to you for a remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and for a renewing of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Then the blessed Xanthippe, receiving the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, returned to her own house, rejoicing and praising the Lord. The porter seeing her complained loudly in violent words, that her going out might be deemed to have been without his will if Probus should notice it; but he that gave her light along with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> kept the whole house, together with Probus, in a deep sleep, and they did not hear his words at all. Then she went running into her bed-chamber, saying, What shall I say of you, searcher out of sinners, who art most present with us in tribulations. Your goodness does these things, since for the sake of man whom you made you went down even to death, for, however much man stir you to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> many times, yet you, Lord, pour out your mercies upon him. O depth of compassion and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of mercy; O immeasurable goodness and incomparable kindness; O treasure of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and giver of mercy, and enricher of all that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in you! If, therefore, one who loves you say, Be near me, Lord, you have already anticipated him. If he say, I give you thanks; hear my words, before they are spoken, you understand. And as for those that ask of you, you give to each after his asking. Your goodness seeks out those that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you not, and you run to sinners. O cheerful look, filling the ways of sinners with mercy; O excellent watching and exhortation of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>! Who shall tell my lord <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> that has now befallen me, that he might come and give words of thanksgiving for me to this protector of sinners? Come many and behold and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Lord, who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but has mercy on sinners. Come, now, O <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, preacher of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for with you even now I sit under instruction, and give words of thanksgiving for me, for I desire to keep silence, since <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reason makes me afraid, lest I have not the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of eloquence. I desire to keep silence, and am compelled to speak, for some one inflames and sweetens me within. If I say, I will shut my mouth, there is some one that murmurs in me. Shall I say a great thing? Is it not that teacher that is in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, without arrogance, filling the heavens, speaking within and waiting without, sitting on the throne with the father and stretched upon the cross by man. What, therefore, I shall do I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. My worthless mind delights me, and is not unfolded to the end. You that had your hands fixed with nails and your side pierced with the spear, you star out of Jacob and lion's cubs out of Judah, you rod out of Jesse, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> out of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, you invisible God in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that canst not be looked upon by <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, and art mocked in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> be to you, who appeared on the earth and wast taken by the people, hung upon the tree and by the report of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> said to be stolen, and that hast bought us all together.</p>

<p>15. While she was still speaking thus, there appeared a cross on the eastern wall, and straightway there entered through it a beautiful youth, having round about him trembling rays, and under him an extended light, on which also he walked. And as he entered within, all the foundations of that house shook and sounded with a great trembling. Xanthippe seeing him cried out and fell to the ground as if dead; but he being pitiful and kind, changing immediately into the shape of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, raised her up, saying, Arise, Xanthippe, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not, for the servants of God are thus <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. Then Xanthippe arising, gazed upon him, and thinking it to be <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, How are you come in hither, preacher of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeing that I have given five hundred pieces of gold to the porter, and that although he is my slave, while you have no money? The Lord said to her, My servant <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is richer than all <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, for whatsoever treasure he acquires here he sends it before him into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, that departing there he may rest in the unending and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rest. This is the treasure of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, you and your like. Then Xanthippe gazing upon him, desirous to say something, saw his face shining as the light; and being greatly amazed, and putting both her hands over her face she threw herself to the ground, and said, Hide yourself, Lord, from my bodily eyes and enlighten my understanding, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> now who you are. You are he whose precursor was the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, the only begotten son of the Father alone above, and only son of the Virgin alone below. You are he who was pierced in the hands and who rent the rocks. You are he whom none other can carry except the bosom of the Father.</p>

<p>16. And as she spoke thus the Lord was again hidden from her, and Xanthippe, coming to herself, said, Woe is me wretched one, that no one has told me what is the gratitude of slaves towards their master. If <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the preacher of the Lord were here, how could he give praise? But perchance in the face of such favors and gifts they are silent, possessed only with tears, for it is not possible worthily to praise any one according to his favour. Saying this she was seized with great faintness from lack of food, for having been strongly possessed with desire for Christ she had forgotten to take nourishment. Therefore, being greatly exhausted by abstinence and the vision and want of sleep and other austerities, she was unable to rise from the ground.</p>

<p>17. And Probus arose from his couch with a very gloomy countenance, for in his sleep he had seen a dream, and was greatly troubled concerning it. But the porter seeing him about to issue to the market-place, having his countenance thus troubled, was greatly afraid, Lest, said he, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what has happened, and will miserably destroy me. Probus, however, having gone forth and signified to those in the market what was fitting for the day and season, speedily returned into the house, and said to his servants, Call me quickly the wise men Barandus and Gnosteas. When they were summoned he said to them, I have seen a very terrible vision, and what appeared in it is difficult for our power to interpret. This, however, do ye disclose to me, as being the most excellent of all the world. Expound it to me when I tell it you. Barandus says to him, If the vision can be interpreted by our wisdom, we shall explain it to you, but if it be of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that is now spoken of we cannot expound it to you, for it is of another wisdom and understanding. However, let our lord and master tell the dream, and let us see if there is any explanation for it. Probus says to Gnosteas, Wherefore do you answer nothing? Gnosteas said, I have not heard the dream, and what can I say but whatever it may be, if it is by reason of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? Tell me now, and you will find it so. Probus said, I thought I was standing in a certain unknown and strange country, and that there sat there an <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiop</a> king, who ruled over all the earth and seemed never to have any successor. There stood beside him multitudes of servants, and all hastened to destruction and had mastery far and wide. And when that <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiop</a> seemed to have gained his purpose, there arose a raven and standing above him croaked with a pitiful voice. And straightway there arose from the eastern parts an eagle, and seized his kingdom, and his power was made vain, and those standing by him fled to the eagle. Then that king strove against those that fled to the eagle, but the eagle carried it up into heaven, and, behold, there came a helper to those that fled to the eagle and left his staff to them. Then they laying hold of it were not overcome by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of that king. So many as ran to those who had the staff, he washed them in pure water, and they that were washed had power over his kingdom. And by that staff the enemies of the king were put to flight, therefore capable men laying hold of the staff turned to themselves great multitudes. And that king strove against them, and had no might at all, but he hindered many from believing in him that sent out the men into the world to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and for that reason many were grieved. Nevertheless, this one did not constrain any like the other, for he himself was ruler of all light. This then was the end.</p>

<p>18. Then the wise Barandus said, By the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God I shall tell the things sent into the world by the Lord. The king whom you saw is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a>, and the multitudes of his servants are the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and the throngs about him are they that worship the gods. Whereas he thought to have no successor, he looked not for the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The raven betokened the weakness of his kingdom, for the raven kept not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the righteous <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, but loved pitiful things. The eagle that arose and took away his kingdom and carried it up into heaven, and that there came a protector of those that fled to the eagle, having a staff, that is the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who left to them his staff, that is, his precious cross; and that he washed those that fled to him signifies the invulnerable breast-plate of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and therefore they were not overcome. The capable men sent into the world with the cross are the preachers of God like <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> who is now with us, against whom that king has no power. This was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you because even on those who are hard of belief God has compassion in some way. See therefore whether even you will be able to injure <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> though you desire, for the mighty power that shields him has been shown you by the Lord. Therefore, understand what has been said to you by me, and serve not that king of darkness, for as you saw his kingdom vanish away, so shall all his servants perish with him. Come now, therefore, my Lord, let us go to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> from him, lest <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> have mastery over us also. Probus said, Let us first go to Xanthippe and see whether she still lives, for behold there are twenty-nine days since she has tasted anything; for I saw her face in the evening, and it was as of one prepared to depart.</p>

<p>19. And as they went into the chamber, they heard her singing.</p>

<p>Praise the Lord you sinners also, because he accepts your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> also. <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>.</p>

<p>Praise the Lord you that have despaired like me, for many are his mercies. <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>.</p>

<p>Praise him you ungodly, because for you he was crucified. <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>.</p>

<p>Praise him you that strive for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of sinners, because God loves you. <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>.</p>

<p>Praise him, you that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at the calling of sinners, because you are fellow citizens with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>.</p>

<p>As she said these words and more than these with tears, the wise men Barandus and Gnosteas opening the door entered and fell at her feet, saying, Pray for us lowly ones, O servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that he may bring us also into your number. But she said to them, Brethren, I am not <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> who remits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but neither is he far from you. Therefore fall not before my knees, but go to him, who is also more able to benefit you. Then they came running to the house of Philotheus to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and found him teaching a great multitude. And Probus also came to hear <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and Xanthippe entered along with him to salute him, and coming near to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and bending her knees she did him reverence. Probus seeing this marvelled that her so <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> spirit had changed to so great humility, for she sat beside the feet of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> on the ground humbly and as one of the worthless. And Probus was greatly grieved, not yet attending to the hearing of the word, but was ever gazing and fixing his attention on Xanthippe.</p>

<p>20. The great <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was teaching thus, Let those that burn in the flesh observe lawful marriage, avoiding fornication, especially that with another's wife, and let those that are united keep to one another. Probus heard this teaching with delight, and said, O <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, how excellently and wisely you employ this teaching. Why then has Xanthippe withdrawn from me? And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, My son Probus, they that foresee that the works of men shall be tried with fire, and that have always in their mind the inexorableness of death, cast out all desire that cleaves to the flesh. But woe when the desire shall judge him that desired, then he shall gnash his teeth to no effect and in vain, for the amendment of repentance is past. Hearing this Probus went up into his house marvelling, and tasted nothing that day, but went and lay down upon his bed. And about the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a> of the night he arose and said, Alas, how wretched was the day in which I was wedded to Xanthippe. Would that I had died and not seen her. Saying this he arose and said, I shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Perchance he will do to me also what is fitting, that I may not become a reproach in the world, being rejected by her. And straightway falling upon the ground he said, O God of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, if, as I have heard from Xanthippe, you seek after the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and turn back those that are astray, do to me also what is fitting; for you are the king of life and death, as I have heard, and have dominion over things in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and over all the thoughts and desires of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and to you alone belongs <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p>21. Then Probus arising from the ground fell again upon the couch, and arising early he came to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and finding him baptising many in the name of the life-giving Trinity, he said, My lord <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, if only I were worthy to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, behold the hour. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said to him, Son, behold the water is ready for the cleansing of those that come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore immediately taking off his garments, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> laying hold of him, he leapt into the water, saying, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>, and everlasting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let all my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be taken away by this water. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, We baptise you in the name of the Father and Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. After this he made him to receive the eucharist of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Then Xanthippe, being greatly rejoiced, began in the house toward evening together with her husband to give good cheer to all those in the house, and to prepare a feast, and when they came, after giving orders for the supper to be magnificent she herself went up to the chamber. And behold on the stairs a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> coming in the likeness of one of the actors, and standing in a dark corner, was desirous to frighten and terrify Xanthippe. But she thinking it to be the actor that she ordinarily had, said in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, Many a time have I said to him that I no longer care for toys, and he despises me as being a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; and straightway seizing an iron lamp-stand, she hurled it at his face, and crushed all his features. Then the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> cried out, saying, O <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, from this destroyer even <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> have received power to strike us. But Xanthippe was greatly afraid.</p>

<p>22. After supper then Probus went forth to hear the word, but Xanthippe sitting in her bed-chamber was reading the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, her sister Polyxena lying upon the couch. Xanthippe loved Polyxena exceedingly, because she was younger than herself, and beautiful in appearance, and Probus also loved her greatly. And as Polyxena lay upon the couch she saw this dream, that a dragon, hideous in appearance, came and signified to her to come to him, and when she did not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> him to go to him, he came running and swallowed her. From <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of this the girl leapt up trembling, and Xanthippe running to her said, What has happened to you, dearest, that you have leapt up thus suddenly? She for a long time was unable to speak; then coming to herself she said, Alas, my sister Xanthippe, what danger or tribulation awaits me, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not; for I saw in my dream that a hideous dragon came and signed to me to go to him, and, when I would not go, he came running and swallowed me, beginning at my feet. While I was terrified at this, there suddenly spoke out of the air, in the light of the sun, a beautiful youth, whom I thought to be the brother of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, saying, Verily, you have no power. Who also took me by the hand and straightway drew me out of him, and straightway the dragon disappeared. And behold his hand was full of sweet odour as of balsam or anything else for fragrance. Xanthippe said to her, Truly you must be greatly troubled, my sister Polyxena, but God has you dear, seeing that he has shown you strange and marvellous things. Therefore arise quickly in the morning and receive the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and ask in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to be delivered from the snares of the dragon.</p>

<p>23. Xanthippe, having said this to Polyxena, and having made a cross of wood, went to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, but Polyxena remained alone in the bed-chamber, her nurse having gone together with Xanthippe. And about the middle of the night, a certain man, powerful in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and assistance, finding the doors open and using magical arts, entered within, desiring to carry away Polyxena. She discovering this fled into the mill, but the magicians led by the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> found her. And she, not finding any door to escape by, said, Alas that I am given over to this destroyer; for she had heard that he was at enmity with her suitor, and he did this to assail and vex him, being a man who was a robber and exceeding cruel. Therefore seizing her they went out of the city, dragging her to the sea. She looked round this way and that, but there was none to deliver her, and groaning she said, Alas, my sister Xanthippe, you sent seven hundred pieces of gold to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and buy books, that through them you might prophesy by me; for this evening you read, I looked to my right hand and beheld, but there was no one that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> me; flight perished from me and there is no one that seeks out my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. </p>

<p>24. While she said these words, those that were dragging her away walked in haste, and coming to the shore they hired a ship and sailed for Babylonia, for he that carried her off had a brother there, a ruler of a district. But the wind blew against them, so that they could not proceed by reason of it, and as they were rowing on the sea, behold the great apostle of the Lord, Peter, was sailing past in a ship, being urged by a dream to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, because when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> departed for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> there had entered into Rome a certain deceiver and magician, Simon by name, and had broken up the church which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had established. And, behold, as he journeyed he heard a voice from heaven saying to him, Peter, tomorrow there will meet you a ship coming from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; arise, therefore, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is troubled in it. As soon therefore as Peter saw the ship, remembering the dream, he said, O Jesus, that hast care for the troubled, whom the tribulation of those in a strange land moves to compassion, whom the weeping of those in captivity made to come upon the earth, who givest us at all time whatsoever we desire, and never turnest away from our request, show now also pity and assistance to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is tossed about in that ship, because you, O Lord, pity at all time those in pain. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> then, perceiving his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, said to the magicians, Avoid the course of that ship, for if we meet with it, we cannot move.</p>

<p>25. But the loving God taking care for Polyxena, the vessel arrived in Greece, the blessed Philip being there, and having come down to the shore by a vision, and there accompanied him also great multitudes of those who were being taught by him. And behold the vessel wherein was Polyxena appeared, terribly tossed about. And the blessed Philip said, Behold the vessel on account of which we came down here, in which there is a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in trouble. When the vessel arrived and all had disembarked upon the dry land, they lay as half dead, because they had been greatly tossed about in the sea. But the apostle Philip ordered Polyxena to be lifted and taken to the place where he was lodging, and the rest to be looked to. But he that had carried off Polyxena, recovering from the disorder of the sea, was desirous to take her again, for Philip, having entrusted Polyxena to one of those that were taught by him, went on his way rejoicing. But he that had her said, She was committed to me by a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, and I cannot give her up to you. He, however, giving no heed to him and finding there a kinsman of his, a nobleman, prepared for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, gathering eight thousand men. Polyxena, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this, went forth by night and departed, but he that had charge of Polyxena said, Taking the tunic of Philip, I shall go forth alone to meet them; but as he said this it was announced to him that the maid was not there. Then he, leaving all thought of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, ran into the bed-chamber, and not finding the maid threw himself on the ground, saying, Woe is me, wretched one, that have become an enemy of Philip. What shall I answer him, when he asks the maiden from me? His servants came and said to him, Arise, our lord, from the ground, for the forces have surrounded your house, and the maid cannot be found. He said, Leave me thus to die on her account. Perhaps, even by this, Philip the servant of Christ may be fully satisfied, since I shall be found despising his command. Then the servants, seeing that he heeded them not, took counsel to flee from the enemies, but again after a little, being moved by the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they said, It is not right for our master to die. Come, let us go forth to meet them, raising the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>. Then raising the precious cross they went forth, about thirty men, upon the enemy, and slew five thousand, and the rest fled. And they returned with victory to their master, praising God and saying, What God is so great as our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has not suffered his servant to be slain by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>? And coming upon their lord, still weeping, they said to him, Arise, lord, and weep not, for it befits it to be not as we will, but as the Lord wills.</p>

<p>26. Polyxena, however, going out of the city, and not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> by what way she should walk, found herself in desert places of the hills, and sitting down said thus with tears, Woe is me, outcast and captive, that I cannot find even a wild beast's den to rest in. Woe is me, left desolate, that not even Hades, that no one escapes, has devoured me. Woe is me, who at one time showed myself not even to my servants, and now display myself to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Woe is me, that I am now made manifest to all those by whom I disdained to be seen. Alas for me that was formerly devoted to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; for this now even the mercy of God has passed me in silence. Whom, then, shall I call upon to help me? The God of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> whom I have constantly offended? But who shall help me now? No one sees or heeds or hears my groaning. Verily I shall beseech Him that sees the hidden things, for who is more pitiful and compassionate than He who always keeps watch over the oppressed? But because my mouth is unclean and defiled, I dare not ask help from Him. Would that I were as one of the wild beasts that I might not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what captivity is. Would that I had been drowned in the sea; perhaps having received the divine <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> I should have gone where no one is made captive. What then shall I do, for death delays, and night has come on, and there is no help anywhere. Having said thus, she arose and began to walk onwards, and passing through a small defile she fell into a wood very thick and large, and finding there a hollow in a tree, which was the den of a lioness, she sat down there, for the lioness had gone forth for her food. And sitting down she said, O wretched begetting, O grievous hour in which I, unhappy one, came into this world; O mother that bore me, why, foreseeing my troubles and wanderings, did you name me Polyxena? Has any other ever fallen into such tribulations and misfortunes? Truly, my sister Xanthippe, did you read concerning me, unhappy one, saying, I have suffered affliction and been utterly bowed down <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa037.htm#verse6">Psalm 38:6</a></span>. These words you uttered with grief, while I lay upon the couch, thinking not at all of my sorrows. On this account I have now come into the depths of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and pass the night in deserts like a wild beast. But the beasts live with others of their kind, while I am left solitary, as not being of one race with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>.</p>

<p>27. And as she was saying these words, and more than these, the morning dawned, and the lioness came from her hunting. Polyxena, seeing the wild beast, trembled and said, By the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, O wild beast, have compassion on me and tear me not until I receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And the wild beast, fearing the <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjuration</a>, immediately went away, and standing afar off gazed at her. And she said, Behold, the beast has <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> me; I will also retire from its dwelling. And immediately she began to journey towards the east, and the beast went before her until she had come out of the wood. Then Polyxena said, What shall I give to you in return, O beast? The God of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> will repay you this kindness; and the wild beast, hearing her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, immediately returned to its place. Then she, descending, found a public road, and standing on it wept, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> whither she should go, and though many went past, she turned to none of them, but said, Perchance the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> will remember me, and whoever shall have pity upon me, to him will I go.</p>

<p>28. As she said this, Andrew, the apostle of the Lord, also came journeying to that place, and as he drew near to Polyxena he felt in his heart some commotion arising in himself. Standing, therefore, to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and folding his arms in the shape of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, he said, Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, partaker of light and knower of things hidden, from whom nothing on earth is hid, do unto me kindness and mercy, and make clear to me this commotion of heart, and calm my reason, you that makest peace always with those that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> peace. Then Polyxena ran to him, and Andrew, the apostle of the Lord, said to her, Approach me not, daughter, but tell me who and whence you are. Polyxena said, My lord, I am a stranger here, but I see your face is gracious, and your words as the words of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and I suppose you to be of the same God. Andrew understood that she spoke of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and said to her, And whence do you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? She said, From my own country, for I left him in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Andrew said to her, And how do you happen to be here, the country being far distant? She said, Because it was thus appointed for me, and came to pass; but I beseech you and fall at your feet, seal me, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> seals, by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of regeneration, so that even I, lowly one, may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the kind <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeing my tribulation and distress, sent you to pity me. Andrew, the great apostle of the Lord, said to her, Let us go, daughter, where there is water.</p>

<p>29. And when they had gone no long way, they came to a well most transparent and pure. And as the blessed Andrew stood to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> beside the well, behold a certain maiden named Rebecca, of the tribe of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, brought as a captive to that country, came to draw water at the well, and seeing the blessed Andrew, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him by his appearance. For Rebecca said, This is the appearance of a Prophet, and this is one of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. And bowing down to him she said, Have mercy on me, servant of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who am captive and sold for the third time, who was once <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and am now insulted by idolaters, and recall me, lowly one, you that wast sent to call back many sinners. Andrew, the apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, said, God will care for you also, daughter, as well as for this stranger. Therefore, receive now <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and be as of one people, glorifying God always.</p>

<p>30. Therefore the apostle standing <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and, behold, the lioness came running, and stood gazing upon him. And <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">Andrew</a> the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> of the Lord said, What then does this beast wish? The lioness opening her mouth spoke with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> voice, Andrew, apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of her, that stands on your right hand, has overtaken me. Therefore confirm and instruct and admonish them in the right and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for they greatly desire the name of the Lord. And, behold, the wonderful condescension of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that even on irrational and untamable beasts he has poured out his mercy. The blessed Andrew weeping said, What shall I say or what shall I speak concerning your mercy, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that thus you at all times cleave to the lowly, and take care of those in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, being without arrogance and full of mercy? And having completed the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> he baptised the maidens in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Then the lioness immediately set off to the mountain, and the Apostle Andrew said to the maidens, Be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>, daughters, to be of good repute before God by living well in a strange land, and separate not from each other, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is always present to those that call upon him, keep you in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, driving away from you the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>. And <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> also for me. Polyxena said, We will follow you wherever you go. The Apostle Andrew said, This was not made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me by the Lord, daughters; therefore remain with peace, hoping in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and he will preserve you to the end.</p>

<p>31. And Andrew went his way rejoicing and glorifying God. Then said Polyxena, Whither shall we go, sister? Rebecca said, Let us depart whither you will, lest my mistress send and separate us. Polyxena said, Come, let us depart into the mountain to the lioness. Rebecca said, It is indeed better for us to live with wild beasts and perish of hunger than to be compelled by Greeks and idolaters to fall into the filth of marriage. So they began to journey, and, behold, by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they met a man driving asses, who seeing them said, You are not of this country, and, as I see, you wear not its dress. Command therefore of your servant to eat bread and receive one piece of silver that you may remember your servant when you buy bread. And he made haste and took the sacks off his asses and spread them on the ground, and made the maidens to sit upon them and said to them, Seeing that the wine which your servant carries is gathered by Greeks, tell me of what <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> you are, that thus we may taste of it. Polyxena said, We, brother, taste no wine, and are of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. The ass-driver said. Is this God upon earth? Polyxena said to him, God is everywhere, both in heaven and on earth. The ass-driver, being desirous to learn clearly, said, Does this <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> then have the same God that is preached by Philip? Polyxena, learning that he was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, said, Yea, brother, this is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Philip preach.</p>

<p>32. The ass-driver hearing this wept unceasingly, and Polyxena said, Has then the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God overtaken you, that you weep thus? The ass-driver said, If you are desirous to learn wherefore I weep, hear the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for one ought not to grudge to tell the things of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. I was a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Philip, the apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and seeing how all his thought was towards the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, I took all that I had and sold it. And taking the price, I bought bread and wine, and divided them throughout the cities to those that had need, when therefore I had done this for some time in the neighbouring city, a certain maimed person cried out, saying (though it was not himself that spoke, but <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> through his mouth), I desire nothing, I take nothing from you, because you are a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Then the whole city arose against me and sought to take me, but some ran one way and some another, while I go through their midst and no one sees me. And issuing from the city I gave praise and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to God that thus I had been rewarded, and I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to my God that I should meet some one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name, so that relating these things I might obtain relief. For the men of this country will not hear at all concerning Christ, being full of impiety and filled with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. I exhort you therefore, take also one coin from me, and if it seem good, take rest also upon the asses. Polyxena said, May you obtain mercy from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, brother. But if you will receive a full reward, save us as far as the sea, so that, if God wills, we may sail for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>.</p>

<p>33. The ass-driver, as if commanded by the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, eagerly receiving the maidens, went on his way rejoicing in the Lord. And he said to Polyxena, Alter your appearance to that of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, lest for your beauty's sake some one snatch you away from me. And coming to an inn, they stayed there, and on the morrow they went forward taking heed to the way. And behold there came past a certain prefect journeying to Greece, who seeing the maidens ordered Polyxena to be carried off on his chariot. Then the ass-driver followed, crying and saying, A prefect does <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to none. Why do ye this? Then they beat him and drove him away.</p>

<p>34. And he going on his way lamented, saying, Woe is me, wretched and abominable one. Woe is me that thought to do good, but now I have wrought mischief. Woe is me that my trouble and my running were unacceptable. Would that I had died before yesterday, that I might not have met with these maidens at all. But why do you trouble me, O wretched <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Let us go to Philip the apostle of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If there is not forgiveness for me, it is better for me to choose death in whatsoever fashion than to live with such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and bitter <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. So he went and found Philip the apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and said to him, O <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> and preacher of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, thus and thus it has happened to me and befallen me. Has my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? Philip the apostle of Christ said, Be not distressed concerning this, my son, it is impossible for them to be dishonoured, seeing that no one ever overcomes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for this same Polyxena, when she first came from the sea, I entrusted to a certain brother, who also was greatly distressed because of her running away secretly from his house. Him also I persuaded not to grieve, for through her tribulation and wanderings many shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God.</p>

<p>35. The prefect therefore carried Polyxena to the city where he stayed, and ordered her to be shut up in a chamber. And one of the soldiers seized Rebecca, but the maid secretly escaping fled into the house of an old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who received the maiden kindly and entreated her well. And sitting down she wept, saying, Alas, my sister Polyxena, I wretched one did not think that anyone was oppressed like myself, but now I am persuaded and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all my misfortunes and tribulations do not compare with one day of yours. And most grievous of all, behold I have been separated from you and am again a captive, but search for me even into the next world, my sister Polyxena. The old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said to her, What ails you, daughter, that you weep thus bitterly? Rebecca said, Allow me, mother, to be distressed and to lament the great and incurable pain of my heart. The old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> greatly compassionating her wept exceedingly, for the maid had told her all that had happened to her, and how through Polyxena she had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. So too Polyxena, shut up in the chamber, said, Woe is me, wretched one; alas for me miserable one; now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> clearly how the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, but O Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, God of all, since I dare not beseech you of myself, I bring to you the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> preacher <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, that you may not suffer my <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> to be destroyed by any one.</p>

<p>36. And as she was yet <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, the attendants came to lead her to the couch of the prefect. But Polyxena said to them, Brethren, make not haste to any one's destruction, for this time shall quickly pass away, and they that work together with the destroyers shall perish with them. Rather assist strangers, that you be not found strangers to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The men, being shamed by these words, went to the prefect and said, The maid from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is seized with a violent fever. And the prefect said, Let her alone. And, behold, the son of the prefect came to Polyxena by night, and she seeing him was afraid, but the youth said to her, Fear not, girl. I seek not to be wedded with you as the bridegroom of destruction, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that you are the bride of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of heaven. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this God who is never overcome by any one, for a certain man of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> countenance lately in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> preached this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a certain maid, whose name was Thecla, believing him followed him, and encountered dangers on account of her beauty, of whom I have heard that she was condemned to the wild beasts. I therefore continually gazed upon the man, and he having observed me said to me, God give heed to you, my son. From that time therefore by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ I have not gone into the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, but sometimes feigning illness and sometimes involving myself in some business, my father said to me, Because you have no <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the gods, therefore neither are you in health, not being worthy of the gods. But I rejoiced, hearing that I was not worthy of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; and, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are you come hither as a <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> to me. Polyxena said, And what is the name of that man? The youth said, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is his name. Polyxena said, He is in my city. The youth said, Come then, girl, put on my appearance, and go down to the shore and wait me there; I having taken money will come quickly.</p>

<p>37. And one of the servants overhearing them told all this to the prefect, who being filled with great <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> condemned them to be cast to the wild beasts. And when they were cast into the arena, a fierce lioness was let loose upon them, which ran and embraced the feet of Polyxena, and licked the soles of her feet. Then the prefect and all the city, seeing this fearful and wonderful sight, gave praise and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the merciful <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> you are, and he, that is named by Polyxena, alone is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the gods of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> are the works of men's hands, unable to save or assist any one. Let them perish now, both themselves and their makers. And the prefect straightway taking his son and Polyxena into the palace, heard from them in order the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and religion in Christ without omission, and he and all in the city <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and there was great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and giving of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And Polyxena said to the prefect, Be of good cheer, my lord, for the man of God will quickly come, who will perfectly teach, exhort, instruct, and enlighten you in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. She however prepared in all haste to depart into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>.</p>

<p>38. And as I, Onesimus, was sailing into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, I received from the Lord a revelation saying to me, Onesimus, the vessel in which you now are will land in the parts of Greece, and you will find on the shore of the harbour two maids and one youth. Assist them and take them to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. When we reached this place according to the command of the Lord, we found the maids together with the youth seeking a vessel. When the maids saw us therefore, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that we were of the hope of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and Polyxena running to us said, Verily the man of God cannot be concealed, for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and kindliness of his countenance makes him manifest. And when we sought to sail away, the sea was troubled by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And there was with us a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, by name Lucius, capable in word to teach the city. Therefore we remained seven days, and God opened to that place a great door of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and twenty thousand <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and there was great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and rejoicing in all the city. And when the season was favourable for us to sail the prefect again constrained us, and we stayed another seven days, until all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and rejoiced in the Lord.</p>

<p>39. Thus now by the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the prefect sent us away with supplies for the voyage, sending also his son with us. And when we had sailed twenty days, Polyxena was greatly exhausted, and we touched at a certain island for the sake of rest. And behold, certain fierce and hardened men, coming down to us and seeing Polyxena, prepared for battle; but by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ our men defended Polyxena and vanquished them, although the strangers were more numerous and more powerful. Polyxena therefore fearing again to become a captive threw herself into the sea; but the pilot dragged her out, having suffered no harm. Then we embarked in the vessel and fled, for the places were rough and wooded, and we were afraid to remain, and in twelve days we arrived in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>40. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> seeing us rejoiced greatly, and said, Welcome ye that have been troubled. And Polyxena, laying hold of his feet, said, It may be that this trouble came upon me because I would have <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> you, but now I beseech and entreat that I may not again be delivered into such troubles and misfortunes. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, weeping, Thus must we be troubled, my daughter, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> our defender, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p>41. And while we were giving the letters of the brethren to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, one ran and told Xanthippe of the arrival of Polyxena. And she made haste and came to us, and seeing Polyxena, was overcome by an unspeakable <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and fell to the ground; but Polyxena embracing her and caressing her for a long time brought her back to life. Then Xanthippe said to her, I, my <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sister Polyxena, went not forth at all for forty days, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> much for you to the loving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that your <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> might not be taken away. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the preacher of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, said to me, Her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> will not be taken away, and she will come quickly. And Probus said to me, It was assigned to her by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be thus afflicted. Do you see how by many devices God saves many? But now, my beloved sister, having unexpectedly seen your face, now I shall willingly die.</p>

<p>42. Then he who had carried her away came up again and sought for Polyxena, but the great <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> persuaded him to refrain from her, and he also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and was baptised by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, as also the suitor of Polyxena <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and there was great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in all that city of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> for the recovery of Polyxena. From that time forward she left not at all the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> in her <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. These things then being thus, all rejoiced in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, glorifying Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and power, now and ever and to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
