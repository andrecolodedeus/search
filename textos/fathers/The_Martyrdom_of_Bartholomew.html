<h1>The Martyrdom of Bartholomew</h1>

<p>Historians declare that India is divided into three parts; and the first is said to end at <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, and the second at Media, and the third completes the country; and the one portion of it ends in the dark, and the other in the ocean. To this India, then, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Bartholomew the apostle of Christ went, and took up his quarters in the temple of Astaruth, and lived there as one of the pilgrims and the poor. In this temple, then, there was an idol called Astaruth, which was supposed to heal the infirm, but rather the more injured all. And the people were in entire <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and from want of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but rather from the difficulty <em>of going to any other</em>, they all fled for refuge to the false god. And he brought upon them troubles, infirmities, damage, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and much affliction; and when any one <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to him, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, retiring, appeared to give a cure to the person in trouble; and the foolish people, seeing this, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him. But the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> retired, not because they wished to cure men, but that they might the more assail them, and rather have them altogether in their power; and thinking that they were cured bodily, those that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to them were the more diseased in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>And it came to pass, that while the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Bartholomew, stayed there, Astaruth gave no response, and was not able for curing. And when the temple was full of sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to him daily, Astaruth could give no response; and sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who had come from far countries were lying there. When, therefore, in that temple not even one of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> was able to give a response, and was of benefit neither to those that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to them nor to those who were in the agonies of death on their account, they were compelled to go to another city, where there was a temple of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, where their great and most eminent god was called Becher.  And having there <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, they demanded, asking why their god Astaruth had not responded to them. And the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> Becher answered and said to them: From the day and hour that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who dwells in the heavens, sent his apostle Bartholomew into the regions here, your god Astaruth is held fast by chains of fire, and can no longer either speak or breathe. They said to him: And who is this Bartholomew? He answered: He is the friend of the Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and has just come into these parts, that he may take away all the worship of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> in the name of his God. And the servants of the Greeks said to him: Tell us what he is like, that we may be able to find him.</p>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> answered and said: He has black hair, a shaggy head, a fair skin,  large eyes, beautiful nostrils, his ears hidden by the hair of his head, with a yellow beard, a few grey hairs, of middle height, and neither tall nor stunted, but middling, clothed with a white undercloak bordered with purple, and upon his shoulders a very white cloak; and his clothes have been worn twenty-six years, but neither are they dirty, nor have they grown old. Seven times  a day he bends the knee to the Lord, and seven times  a night does he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. His voice is like the sound of a strong trumpet; there go along with him <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who allow him neither to be weary, nor to hunger, nor to thirst; his face, and his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and his heart are always glad and rejoicing; he foresees everything, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> and speaks every tongue of every nation. And behold now, as soon as you ask me, and I answer you about him, behold, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the Lord tell him; and if you wish to seek him, if he is willing he will appear to you; but if he shall not be willing, you will not be able to find him. I entreat you, therefore, if you shall find him, entreat him not to come here, lest his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do to me as they have done to my brother Astaruth.</p>

<p>And when the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> had said this, he held his peace. And they returned, and set to work to look into every face of the pilgrims and poor men, and for two days they could find him nowhere. And it came to pass, that one who was a <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniac</a> set to work to cry out: Apostle of the Lord, Bartholomew, your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are burning me up. Then said the apostle to him: Hold your peace, and come out of him. And that very hour, the man who had suffered from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> for many years was set free.</p>

<p>And Polymius, the king of that country, happened to be standing opposite the apostle; and he had a daughter a <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniac</a>, that is to say, a lunatic. And he heard about the <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniac</a> that had been healed, and sent messengers to the apostle, saying: My daughter is grievously torn; I implore you, therefore, as you have delivered him  who suffered for many years, so also to order my daughter to be set free. And the apostle rose up, and went with them. And he sees the king's daughter bound with chains, for she used to tear in pieces all her limbs; and if any one came near her, she used to bite, and no one dared to come near her. The servants say to him: And who is it that dares to touch her? The apostle answered them: Loose her, and let her go. They say to him again: We have her in our power when she is bound with all our force, and do you bid us loose her? The apostle says to them: Behold, I keep her enemy bound, and are you even now afraid of her? Go and loose her; and when she has partaken of food, let her rest, and early tomorrow bring her to me. And they went and did as the apostle had commanded them; and thereafter the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> was not able to come near her.</p>

<p>Then the king loaded camels with gold and silver, precious stones, pearls, and clothing, and sought to see the apostle; and having made many efforts, and not found him, he brought everything back to his palace.</p>

<p>And it happened, when the night had passed, and the following day was dawning, the sun having risen, the apostle appeared alone with the king in his bed-chamber, and said to him: Why did you seek me yesterday the whole day with gold and silver, and precious stones, pearls, and raiment? For these gifts those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> long for who seek earthly things; but I seek nothing earthly, nothing carnal. Wherefore I wish to teach you that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> deigned to be born as a man out of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin's</a> womb. He was conceived in the womb of the virgin; He took to Himself her who was always a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, having within herself Him who made the heaven and the earth, the sea, and all that therein is. He, born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, like <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, took to Himself a beginning in time, He who has a beginning neither of times nor days; but He Himself made every beginning, and everything created, whether in things visible or invisible. And as this virgin did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> man, so she, preserving her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, vowed a vow  to the Lord God. And she was the first who did so. For, from the time that man <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> from the beginning of the world, no <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> made a vow of this mode of life; but she, as she was the first among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who loved this in her heart, said, I offer to You, O Lord, my <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. And, as I have said to you, none of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> dared to speak this word; but she being called for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of many, observed this&mdash; that she might remain a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> through the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, pure and undefiled. And suddenly, when she was shut up in her chamber, the archangel Gabriel appeared, gleaming like the sun; and when she was terrified at the sight, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to her, Fear not, Mary; for you have found favour in the sight of the Lord, and you shall conceive. And she cast off <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and stood up, and said, How shall this be to me, since I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not man? The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> answered her, The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon you, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow you; wherefore also that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing which is born of you shall be called <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.  Thus, therefore, when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had departed from her, she escaped the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who deceived the first man when at rest. For, having tasted of the tree of disobedience, when the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said to him, Eat, he ate; and thus the first man was cast out of paradise, and banished to this life. From him have been born the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Then the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> having been born of the virgin, and having become perfect man, and having been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> having fasted forty days, the tempter came and said to Him: If you are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, tell these stones to become loaves. And He answered: Not on bread alone shall man live, but by every word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note082416"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;4:1-13</a></span> Thus therefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who through eating had conquered the first man, was conquered through the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> of the second man; and as he through want of self-restraint had conquered the first man, the son of the virgin earth, so we shall conquer through the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> of the second Adam, the Son of the Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>The king says to him: And how is it that you said just now that she was the first virgin of whom was born <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>? And the apostle answered: I give thanks to the Lord that you hear me gladly. The first man, then, was called Adam; he was formed out of the earth. And the earth, his mother out of which he was, was virgin, because it had neither been polluted by the blood of man nor opened for the burial of any one. The earth, then, was like the virgin, in order that he who conquered the son of the virgin earth might be conquered by the Son of the Virgin Mary. And, behold, he did conquer; for his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> craft, through the eating of the tree by which man, being deceived, came forth from paradise, kept paradise shut. Thereafter this Son of the virgin conquered all the craft of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. And his craft was such, that when he saw the Son of the virgin <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> forty days, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that He was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, therefore, has not given Himself out to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, except to those who are pure in heart, <span class="stiki" id="note082417"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> and who serve Him by good works. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself, therefore, when he saw that after the forty days He was again hungry, was deceived into thinking that He was not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said to Him, Why have you been hungry? Tell these stones to become loaves, and eat. And the Lord answered him, Listen, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; although you may lord it over man, because he has not kept the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I have fulfilled the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in having fasted, and shall destroy your power, so that you shall no longer lord it over man. And when he saw himself conquered, he again takes Jesus to an exceeding high mountain, and shows Him all the kingdoms of the world, and says, All these will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me. The Lord says to him, Get behind me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>; for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him only shall you serve. And there was a third <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> for the Lord; for he takes Him up to the pinnacle of the temple, and says, If you are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, cast yourself down. The Lord says to him, You shall not tempt the Lord your God. And the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> disappeared. And he indeed that once conquered Adam, the son of the virgin earth, was thrice conquered by Christ, the Son of the Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>And when the Lord had conquered the tyrant, He sent His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> into all the world, that He might redeem His people from the deception of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; and one of these I am, an apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. On this account we seek not after gold and silver, but rather despise them, because we labour to be rich in that place where the kingdom of Him alone endures  for ever, where neither trouble, nor grief, nor groaning, nor death, has place; where there is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessedness, and ineffable <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and everlasting exultation, and perpetual repose. Wherefore also the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> sitting in your temple, who makes responses to you, is kept in chains through the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord who has sent me. Because if you shall be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and wishest yourself to be enlightened, I will make you behold Him, and learn from how great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> you have been redeemed. At the same time hear also by what means he injures all those who are lying sick in the temple. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself by his own art causes the men to be sick, and again to be healed, in order that they may the more <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and in order that he may have place the more in their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, in order that they may say to the stock and the stone, You are our God. <span class="stiki" id="note082419"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse27">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:27</a></span> But that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> who dwells in the idol is held in subjection, conquered by me, and is able to give no response to those who <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> there. And if you wish to prove that it is so, I order him to return into the idol, and I will make him confess with his own mouth that he is bound, and able to give no response.</p>

<p>The king says to him: Tomorrow, at the first hour of the day, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are ready to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> in the temple, and I shall come there, and shall be able to see this wonderful work.</p>

<p>And it came to pass on the following day, as they were <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> began to cry out: Refrain, you wretched ones, from <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> to me, lest ye suffer worse for my sake; because I am bound in fiery chains, and kept in subjection by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> crucified: for, being afraid of him, they condemned him to death. And he <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> Death himself, our king, and he bound our prince in chains of fire; and on the third day, having conquered death and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, rose in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and gave the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> to his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and sent them out into the four quarters of the world; and one of them is here just now, who has bound me, and keeps me in subjection. I implore you, therefore, supplicate him on my account, that he may set me free to go into other habitations.</p>

<p>Then the apostle answered: Confess, unclean <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, who is it that has injured all those that are lying here from heavy diseases? The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> answered: The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, our ruler, he who is bound, he sends us against men, that, having first injured their bodies, we may thus also make an assault upon their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> when they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to us. For then we have complete power over them, when they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in us and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to us. And when, on account of the mischief done to them, we retire, we appear curing them, and are worshipped by them as gods; but in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> we are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and the servants of him who was crucified, the Son of the virgin, have bound us. For from that day on which the Apostle Bartholomew came I am punished, kept bound in chains of fire. And for this reason I speak, because he has commanded me. At the same time, I dare not utter more when the apostle is present, neither I nor our rulers.</p>

<p>The apostle says to him: Why do you not save all that have come to you? The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> says to him: When we injure their bodies, unless we first injure their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, we do not let their bodies go. The apostle says to him: And how do you injure their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>? The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> answered him: When they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we are gods, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to us, God withdraws from those who <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and we do not take away the sufferings of their bodies, but retire into their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</p>

<p>Then the apostle says to the people: Behold, the god whom you thought to cure you, does the more mischief to your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and bodies. Hear even now your Maker who dwells in the heavens, and do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in lifeless stones and stocks. And if you wish that I should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you, and that all these may receive health, take down this idol, and break it to pieces; and when you have done this, I will sanctify this temple in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>; and having <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> all of you who are in it in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the Lord, and sanctified you, I will save all.</p>

<p>Then the king gave orders, and all the people brought ropes and crowbars, and were not at all able to take down the idol. Then the apostle says to them: Unfasten the ropes. And when they had unfastened them, he said to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> dwelling in it: In the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, come out of this idol, and go into a desert place, where neither winged creature utters a cry, nor voice of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has ever been heard. And straightway he arose at the word of the apostle, and lifted it up from its foundations; and in that same hour all the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> that were in that place were broken to pieces.</p>

<p>Then all cried out with one voice, saying: He alone is God Almighty whom Bartholomew the apostle proclaims. Then the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Bartholomew, having spread forth his hands to heaven, said: God of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, who for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men hast sent forth Your only begotten Son, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, in order that He might redeem by His own blood all of us enslaved by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and declare us to be Your sons, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that You exist always to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> God without end: one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, acknowledged in Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Father and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, worshipped in Father and Son; and acknowledged to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> one,  the Father unbegotten, the Son begotten, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> proceeding; and in You the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, Your only begotten Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is, in whose name You have given us power to heal the sick, to cure paralytics, to expel <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and raise the dead: for He said to us, Verily I say unto you, that whatever you shall ask in my name you shall receive. <span class="stiki" id="note082421"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;21:22</a></span> I entreat, then, that in His name all this multitude may be saved, that all may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that  You alone are God in heaven, and in the earth, and in the sea, who seeks the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men through that same <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, with whom You live and reign in unity of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> for ever and ever.</p>

<p>And when all responded to the <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, suddenly there appeared an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord, shining brighter than the sun, winged, and other four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> holding up the four corners of the temple; and with his finger the one sealed the temple and the people, and said: Thus says the Lord who has sent me, As you have all been purified from all your infirmity, so also this temple shall be purified from all uncleanness, and from the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> dwelling in it, whom the apostle of God has ordered to go into a desert place; for so has God commanded me, that I may manifest Him to you. And when you behold Him, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> nothing; but when I make the sign of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, so also do ye with your finger seal your faces, and these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things will flee from you. Then he showed them the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> who dwelt in the temple, like an <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a>, black as soot; his face sharp like a dog's, thin-cheeked, with hair down to his feet, eyes like fire, sparks coming out of his mouth; and out of his nostrils came forth smoke like sulphur, with wings spined like a porcupine; and his hands were bound with fiery chains, and he was firmly kept in. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord said to him: As also the apostle has commanded, I let you go; go where voice of man is not heard, and be there until the great day of judgment. And when he let him go, he flew away, groaning and weeping, and disappeared. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord went up into heaven in the sight of all.</p>

<p>Then the king, and also the queen, with their two sons, and with all his people, and with all the multitude of the city, and every city round about, and country, and whatever land his kingdom ruled over, were saved, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. And the king laid aside his diadem, and followed Bartholomew the apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>And after these things the unbelievers of the Greeks, having come together to Astreges  the king, who was the elder brother of the king who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, say to him: O king, your brother Polymius has become <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> to a certain magician, who has taken down our temples, and broken our gods to pieces. And while they were thus speaking and weeping, behold, again there came also some others from the cities round about, both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>  and people; and they set about weeping and making accusations  before the king. Then King Astreges in a rage sent a thousand armed men along with those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, in order that, wherever they should find the apostle, they might bring him to him bound. And when they had done so, and found him, and brought him, he says to him: Are you he who has perverted my brother from the gods? To whom the apostle answered: I have not perverted him, but have converted him to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The king says to him: Are you he who caused our gods to be broken in pieces? The apostle says to him: I gave power to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> who were in them, and they broke in pieces the dumb and senseless <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God Almighty, who dwells in the heavens. The king says to him: As you have made my brother deny his gods, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so I also will make you reject your God and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in my gods. The apostle says to him: If I have bound and kept in subjection the god which your brother worshipped, and at my order the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> were broken in pieces, if you also are able to do the same to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you can persuade me also to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to your gods; but if you can do nothing to my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I will break all your gods in pieces; but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in my God.</p>

<p>And when he had thus spoken, the king was informed that this god Baldad  and all the other <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> had fallen down, and were broken in pieces. Then the king rent the purple in which he was clothed, and ordered the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> apostle Bartholomew to be beaten with rods; and after having been thus scourged, to be beheaded.</p>

<p>And innumerable multitudes came from all the cities, to the number of twelve thousand, who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in him along with the king; and they took up the remains of the apostle with singing of praise and with all <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and they laid them in the royal tomb, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> God. And the king Astreges having heard of this, ordered him to be thrown into the sea; and his remains were carried into the island of Liparis.</p>

<p>And it came to pass on the thirtieth day after the apostle was carried away, that the king Astreges was overpowered by a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> and miserably strangled; and all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were strangled by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and perished on account of their rising against  the apostle, and thus died by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>.</p>

<p>And there was great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling, and all came to the Lord, and were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> who had been ordained by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> apostle Bartholomew. And according to the commandment of the apostle, all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the people made King Polymius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; and in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> he received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of healing, and began to do signs. And he remained in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> twenty years; and having prospered in all things, and governed the church well, and guided it in right opinions,  he fell asleep in peace, and went to the Lord: to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and strength for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
