<h1>The Martyrdom of Ignatius</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. Desire of Ignatius for martyrdom</h2>

<p>When <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, not long since,  succeeded to the empire of the Romans, <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John the apostle</a>, a man in all respects of an apostolic character, governed the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of the Antiochians</a> with great care, having with difficulty escaped the former storms of the many <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> under <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, inasmuch as, like a good pilot, by the helm of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, by the earnestness of his teaching, and by his [constant ] spiritual labour, he resisted the flood that rolled against him, fearing [only] lest he should lose any of those who were deficient in <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, or apt to suffer from their simplicity.  Wherefore he rejoiced over the tranquil state of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> ceased for a little time, but was grieved as to himself, that he had not yet attained to a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor reached the perfect rank of a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. For he inwardly reflected, that the confession which is made by <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, would bring him into a yet more intimate relation to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Wherefore, continuing a few years longer with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and, like a divine lamp, enlightening every one's understanding by his expositions of the [Holy ] Scriptures, he [at length] attained the object of his desire.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Ignatius is condemned by Trajan</h2>

<p>For <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, in the ninth  year of his reign, being lifted up [with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>], after the victory he had gained over the Scythians and Dacians, and many other nations, and thinking that the religious body of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were yet wanting to complete the subjugation of all things to himself, and [thereupon] threatening them with <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> unless they should agree to  worship d&aelig;mons, as did all other nations, thus compelled  all who were living godly lives either to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> [to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>] or die. Wherefore the noble soldier of Christ [<a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>], being in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of the Antiochians</a>, was, in accordance with his own desire, brought before <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, who was at that time staying at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, but was in haste [to set forth] against Armenia and the Parthians. And when he was set before the <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Emperor Trajan</a>, [that prince] said unto him, <q>Who are you, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> wretch,  who settest  yourself to transgress our commands, and persuadest others to do the same, so that they should miserably perish?</q> <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> replied, <q>No one ought to call Theophorus  <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; for all <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>  have departed from the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if, because I am an enemy to these [spirits], you call me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in respect to them, I quite agree with you; for inasmuch as I have Christ the King of heaven [within me], I destroy all the devices of these [<a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>].</q> <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> answered, <q>And who is Theophorus?</q> <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> replied, <q>He who has Christ within his breast.</q> <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> said, <q>Do <em>we</em> not then seem to you to have the gods in our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, whose assistance we enjoy in fighting against our enemies?</q> <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> answered, <q>You are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> when you call the d&aelig;mons of the nations gods. For there is but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that are in them; and one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, whose kingdom may I enjoy.</q> <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> said, <q>Do you mean Him who was crucified under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>?</q> <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> replied, <q>I mean Him who crucified my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, with him who was the inventor of it,  and who has condemned [and cast down] all the deceit and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> under the feet of those who carry Him in their heart.</q> <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> said, <q>Do you then carry within you Him that was crucified?</q> <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> replied, <q>Truly so; for it is written, 'I will dwell in them, and walk in  them.' </q> <span class="stiki" id="note011411"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:16</a></span> Then <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> pronounced sentence as follows: <q>We command that <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, who affirms that he carries about within him Him that was crucified, be bound by soldiers, and carried to the great [city] Rome, there to be devoured by the beasts, for the gratification of the people.</q> When the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> heard this sentence, he cried out with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, <q>I thank you, O Lord, that You have vouchsafed to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> me with a perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards You, and have made me to be bound with iron chains, like  Your <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>.</q> Having spoken thus, he then, with delight, clasped the chains about him; and when he had first <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and commended it with tears to the Lord, he was hurried away by the savage cruelty  of the soldiers, like a distinguished ram  the leader of a goodly flock, that he might be carried to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, there to furnish food to the bloodthirsty beasts.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Ignatius sails to Smyrna</h2>

<p>Wherefore, with great alacrity and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, through his desire to suffer, he came down from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> to Seleucia, from which place he set sail. And after a great deal of suffering he came to <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, where he disembarked with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and hastened to see the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, [formerly] his fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, and [now] <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Smyrna. For they had both, in old times, been <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of St. John the Apostle. Being then brought to him, and having communicated to him some spiritual gifts, and glorying in his bonds, he entreated of him to labour  along with him for the fulfilment of his desire; earnestly indeed asking this of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (for the cities and Churches of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia</a> had welcomed  the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man through their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, all hastening to meet him, if by any means they might receive from him some  spiritual gift), but above all, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, that, by means of the wild beasts, he soon disappearing from this world, might be manifested before the face of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Ignatius writes to the churches</h2>

<p>And these things he thus spoke, and thus testified, extending his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to Christ so far as one who was about to  secure heaven through his good confession, and the earnestness of those who joined their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to his in regard to his [approaching] conflict; and to give a recompense to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, who came to meet him through their rulers, sending  letters of thanksgiving to them, which dropped spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, along with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and exhortation. Wherefore, seeing all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> so kindly affected towards him, and fearing lest the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the brotherhood should hinder his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> towards the Lord,  while a fair door of suffering <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> was opened to him, he wrote to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Romans the <a href="../fathers/0107.htm">Epistle which is here subjoined</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Ignatius is brought to Rome</h2>

<p>Having therefore, by means of this Epistle, settled,  as he wished, those of the brethren at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> who were unwilling [for his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>]; and setting sail from Smyrna (for Christophorus was pressed by the soldiers to hasten to the public spectacles in the mighty [city] Rome, that, being given up to the wild beasts in the sight of the Roman people, he might attain to the crown for which he strove), he [next] landed at <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a>. Then, going on from that place to Neapolis, he went [on foot] by Philippi through Macedonia, and on to that part of Epirus which is near Epidamnus; and finding a ship in one of the seaports, he sailed over the Adriatic Sea, and entering from it on the Tyrrhene, he passed by the various islands and cities, until, when Puteoli came in sight, he was eager there to disembark, having a desire to tread in the footsteps of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note011422"><a href="../bible/act028.htm#verse13">Acts&nbsp;28:13-14</a></span> But a violent wind arising did not allow him to do so, the ship being driven rapidly forwards;  and, simply expressing his delight  over the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the brethren in that place, he sailed by. Wherefore, continuing to enjoy fair winds, we were reluctantly hurried on in one day and a night, mourning [as we did] over the coming departure from us of this righteous man. But to him this happened just as he wished, since he was in haste as soon as possible to leave this world, that he might attain to the Lord whom he loved. Sailing then into the Roman harbour, and the unhallowed sports being just about to close, the soldiers began to be annoyed at our slowness, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> rejoicingly yielded to their urgency.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Ignatius is devoured by the beasts at Rome</h2>

<p>They pushed forth therefore from the place which is called Portus;  and (the  fame of all relating to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> being already spread  abroad) we met the brethren full of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; rejoicing indeed because they were thought worthy to meet with <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Theophorus</a>, but struck with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> because so eminent a man was being led to death. Now he enjoined some to keep silence who, in their fervent <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, were saying  that they would appease the people, so that they should not demand the destruction of this just one. He being immediately aware of this through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>,  and having saluted them all, and begged of them to show a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> affection towards him, and having dwelt [on this point] at greater length than in his Epistle,  and having persuaded them not to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> him hastening to the Lord, he then, after he had, with all the brethren kneeling [beside him], entreated the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, that a stop might be put to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and that mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> might continue among the brethren, was led with all haste into the amphitheatre. Then, being immediately thrown in, according to the command of C&aelig;sar given some time ago, the public spectacles being just about to close (for it was then a solemn day, as they deemed it, being that which is called the thirteenth  in the Roman tongue, on which the people were wont to assemble in more than ordinary numbers ), he was thus cast to the wild beasts close beside the temple,  that so by them the desire of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> should be fulfilled, according to that which is written, <q>The desire of the righteous is acceptable <span class="stiki" id="note011433"><a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse24">Proverbs&nbsp;10:24</a></span> [to God],</q> to the effect that he might not be troublesome to any of the brethren by the gathering of his remains, even as he had in his Epistle expressed a wish beforehand that so his end might be. For only the harder portions of his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> remains were left, which were conveyed to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and wrapped  in linen, as an inestimable treasure left to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which was in the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Ignatius appears in a vision after his death</h2>

<p>Now these things took place on the thirteenth day before the Kalends of January, that is, on the twentieth of December,  Sura and Senecio being then the consuls of the Romans for the second time. Having ourselves been eye-witnesses of these things, and having spent the whole night in tears within the house, and having entreated the Lord, with bended knees and much <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that He would give us weak men full assurance respecting the things which were done,  it came to pass, on our falling into a brief slumber, that some of us saw the <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">blessed Ignatius</a> suddenly standing by us and embracing us, while others beheld him again <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for us, and others still saw him dropping with sweat, as if he had just come from his great labour, and standing by the Lord. When, therefore, we had with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> witnessed these things, and had compared our several visions  together, we sang praise to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the giver of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and expressed our sense of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> [<a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>]; and now we have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you both the day and the time [when these things happened], that, assembling ourselves together according to the time of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, we may have fellowship with the champion and noble <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who trod under foot the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and perfected the course which, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he had desired, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>; by whom, and with whom, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and power to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, for evermore! <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
