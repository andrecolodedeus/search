<h1>The Martyrdom of Justin</h1>

<p class="h1a">The martyrdom of the holy martyrs Justin, Chariton, Charites, P&aelig;on and Liberianus, who suffered at Rome</p>

<h2>Chapter 1. Examination of Justin by the prefect</h2>

<p>In the time of the lawless partisans of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> decrees were passed against the godly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in town and country, to force them to offer libations to vain <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; and accordingly the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, having been apprehended, were brought before the prefect of Rome, Rusticus by name. And when they had been brought before his judgment-seat, said to <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>, <q>Obey the gods at once, and submit to the kings.</q>  <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> said, <q>To <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the commandments of our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is worthy neither of blame nor of condemnation.</q> Rusticus the prefect said, <q>What kind of doctrines do you profess?</q> <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> said, <q>I have endeavoured to learn all doctrines; but I have acquiesced at last in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrines, those namely of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, even though they do not please those who hold false opinions.</q> Rusticus the prefect said, <q>Are those the doctrines that please you, you utterly wretched man?</q> <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> said, <q>Yes, since I adhere to them with right dogma.</q>  Rusticus the prefect said, <q>What is the dogma?</q> <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> said, <q>That according to which we worship the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, whom we reckon to be one from the beginning, the maker and fashioner of the whole creation, visible and invisible; and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who had also been preached beforehand by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> as about to be present with the race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the herald of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and teacher of good <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And I, being a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, think that what I can say is insignificant in comparison with His boundless divinity, acknowledging a certain prophetic power,  since it was prophesied concerning Him of whom now I say that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that of old the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> foretold His appearance among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Examination of Justin continued</h2>

<p>Rusticus the prefect said, <q>Where do you assemble?</q> <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> said, <q>Where each one chooses and can: for do you fancy that we all meet in the very same place? Not so; because the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> is not circumscribed by place; but being invisible, fills heaven and earth, and everywhere is worshipped and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.</q> Rusticus the prefect said, <q>Tell me where you assemble, or into what place do you collect your followers?</q> <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> said, <q>I live above one Martinus, at the Timiotinian Bath; and during the whole time (and I am now living in Rome for the second time) I am unaware of any other meeting than his. And if any one wished to come to me, I communicated to him the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> Rusticus said, <q>Are you not, then, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>?</q> <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> said, <q>Yes, I am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Examination of Chariton and others</h2>

<p>Then said the prefect Rusticus to Chariton, <q>Tell me further, Chariton, are you also a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>?</q> Chariton said, <q>I am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> by the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Rusticus the prefect asked the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> Charito, <q>What say you, Charito?</q> Charito said, <q>I am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Rusticus said to Euelpistus, <q>And what are you?</q> Euelpistus, a servant of C&aelig;sar, answered, <q>I too am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, having been freed by Christ; and by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ I partake of the same hope.</q> Rusticus the prefect said to Hierax, <q>And you, are you a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>?</q> Hierax said, <q>Yes, I am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, for I revere and worship the same God.</q> Rusticus the prefect  said, <q>Did <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> make you <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>?</q> Hierax said, <q>I was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and will be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</q> And P&aelig;on stood up and said, <q>I too am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</q> Rusticus the prefect said, <q>Who taught you?</q> P&aelig;on said, <q>From our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> we received this good confession.</q> Euelpistus said, <q>I willingly heard the words of <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>. But from my <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> also I learned to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</q> Rusticus the prefect said, <q>Where are your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>?</q> Euelpistus said, <q>In Cappadocia.</q> Rusticus says to Hierax, <q>Where are your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>?</q> And he answered, and said, <q>Christ is our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> father, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him is our mother; and my earthly <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> died; and I, when I was driven from Iconium in Phrygia, came here.</q> Rusticus the prefect said to Liberianus, <q>And what say you? Are you a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and unwilling to worship [the gods]?</q> Liberianus said, <q>I too am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, for I worship and reverence the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Rusticus threatens the Christians with death</h2>

<p>The prefect says to <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>, <q>Hearken, you who are called learned, and think that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrines; if you are scourged and beheaded, do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you will ascend into heaven?</q> <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> said, <q>I hope that, if I endure these things, I shall have His gifts.  For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, to all who have thus lived, there abides the divine favour until the completion of the whole world.</q> Rusticus the prefect said, <q>Do you suppose, then, that you will ascend into heaven to receive some recompense?</q> <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> said, <q>I do not suppose it, but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and am fully persuaded of it.</q> Rusticus the prefect said, <q>Let us, then, now come to the matter in hand, and which presses. Having come together, offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> with one accord to the gods.</q> <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> said, <q>No right-thinking person falls away from <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to impiety.</q> Rusticus the prefect said, <q>Unless you <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, you shall be mercilessly punished.</q> <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> said, <q>Through <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> we can be saved on account of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, even when we have been punished,  because this shall become to us <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and confidence at the more fearful and universal judgment-seat of our Lord and Saviour.</q> Thus also said the other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>: <q>Do what you will, for we are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and do not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Sentence pronounced and executed</h2>

<p>Rusticus the prefect pronounced sentence, saying, <q>Let those who have refused to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the gods and to yield to the command of the emperor be scourged,  and led away to suffer the punishment of decapitation, according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>.</q> The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> having <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and having gone forth to the accustomed place, were beheaded, and perfected their testimony in the confession of the Saviour. And some of the faithful having secretly removed their bodies, laid them in a suitable place, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> having wrought along with them, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
