<h1>The Narrative of Joseph of Arimathea</h1>

<p><strong>Narrative of Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a, That Begged the Lord's Body; In Which Also He Brings In the Cases of the Two Robbers.</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 1.</h2>

<p>I <em>am</em> Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a, who begged from <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> the body of the Lord Jesus for burial, and who for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> was kept close in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> by the murderous and God-fighting  <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who also, keeping to the law, have by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself become partakers in tribulation and having provoked their Lawgiver to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, crucified Him and made Him manifest to those that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> God. In those days in which they condemned the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to be crucified, seven days before Christ suffered, two condemned <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> were sent from <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>; and their case was as follows:&mdash; </p>

<p>The first, his name Gestas, put travellers to death, murdering them with the sword, and others he exposed naked. And he hung up <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> by the heels, head down, and cut off their breasts, and drank the blood of infants limbs, never having <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, being violent from the beginning, and doing such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</p>

<p>And the case of the other was as follows: He was called Demas, and was by birth a Galil&aelig;an, and kept an inn. He made attacks upon the rich, but was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the poor&mdash; a thief like Tobit, for he buried the bodies of the poor. <span class="stiki" id="note082033"><a href="../bible/tob001.htm#verse17">Tobit&nbsp;1:17-18</a></span> And he set his hand to robbing the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and stole the law  itself in Jerusalem, and stripped naked the daughter of <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, who was priestess of the sanctuary, and took away from its place the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> deposit itself placed there by Solomon. Such were his doings.</p>

<p>And Jesus also was taken on the third day before the passover, in the evening. And to <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> and the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> it was not a passover, but it was a great mourning to them, on account of the plundering of the sanctuary by the robber. And they summoned <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>, and spoke to him, for he was <em>son</em> of the brother  of <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He was not a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> before the face of Jesus; but all the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> craftily supported him, that he might follow Jesus, not that he might be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> done by Him, nor that he might confess Him, but that he might betray Him to them, wishing to catch up some lying word of Him, giving him gifts for such brave, honest conduct to the amount of a half shekel of gold each day. And he did this for two years with Jesus, as says one of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> called John.</p>

<p>And on the third day, before Jesus was laid hold of, Judas says to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: Come, let us hold a council; for perhaps it was not the robber that stole the law, but Jesus himself, and I accuse him. And when these words had been spoken, <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, who kept the keys of the sanctuary, came in to us, and said to all: Do not do such a deed. For <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, more than all the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And the daughter of <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, Sarah by name, cried out, and said: He himself said before all against this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, I am able to destroy this temple, and in three days to raise it. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to her: You have credit with all of us. For they regarded her as a prophetess. And assuredly, after the council had been held, Jesus was laid hold of.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p>And on the following day, the fourth day of the week, they brought Him at the ninth hour into the hall of <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>. And <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> say to Him: Tell us, why have you stolen our law, and renounced  the ordinances of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? And Jesus answered nothing. And again a second time, the multitude also being present, they say to Him: The sanctuary which Solomon built in forty and six years, why do you wish to destroy in one moment? And to these things Jesus answered nothing. For the sanctuary of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> had been plundered by the robber.</p>

<p>And the evening of the fourth day being ended, all the multitude sought to burn the daughter of <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, on account of the loss of the law; for they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how they were to keep the passover. And she said to them: Wait, my children, and let us destroy this Jesus, and the law will be found, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> feast will be fully accomplished. And secretly <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> gave considerable money to <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>, saying: Say as you said to us before, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the law has been stolen by Jesus, that the accusation may be turned against him, and not against this maiden, who is free from blame. And Judas having received this command, said to them: Let not all the multitude <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I have been instructed by you to do this against Jesus; but release Jesus, and I persuade the multitude that it is so. And craftily they released Jesus.</p>

<p>And Judas, going into the sanctuary at the dawn of the fifth day, says to all the people: What will you give me, and I will give up to you the overthrower  of the law, and the plunderer of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to him: If you will give him up to us, we will give you thirty pieces of gold. And the people did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Judas was speaking about Jesus, for many of them confessed that he was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And Judas received the thirty pieces of gold.</p>

<p>And going out at the fourth hour, and at the fifth, he finds Jesus walking in the street. And as evening was coming on, Judas says to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: Give me the aid of soldiers with swords and staves, and I will give him up to you. They therefore gave him officers for the purpose of seizing Him. And as they were going along, Judas says to them: Lay hold of the man whom I shall <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, for he has stolen the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Going up to Jesus, therefore, he kissed Him, saying: Hail, Rabbi! It being the evening of the fifth day. And having laid hold of Him, they gave Him up to <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> and the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Judas saying: This is he who stole the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> gave Jesus an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> trial, saying: Why have you done these things? And he answered nothing.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> and I Joseph, seeing the seat of the plagues,  stood off from them, not wishing to perish along with the counsel of the ungodly.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p>Having therefore done many and dreadful things against Jesus that night, they gave Him up to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> at the dawn of the preparation, that he might crucify Him; and for this purpose they all came together. After a trial, therefore, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> ordered Him to be nailed to the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, along with the two <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>. And they were nailed up along with Jesus, Gestas on the left, and Demas on the right.</p>

<p>And he that was on the left began to cry out, saying to Jesus: See how many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> I have done in the earth; and if I had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that you were the king, I should have cut off you also. And why do you call yourself <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and canst not help yourself in necessity? How can you afford it to another one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for help? If you are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, come down from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, that I may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in you. But now I see you perishing along with me, not like a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but like a wild beast. And many other things he began to say against Jesus, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> and gnashing his teeth upon Him. For the robber was taken alive in the snare of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note082039"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse26">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:26</a></span> </p>

<p>But the robber on the right hand, whose name was Demas, seeing the Godlike <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, thus cried out: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, that You are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. I see You, Christ, adored by myriads of myriads of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Pardon me my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which I have done. Do not in my trial make the stars come against me, or the moon, when You shall judge all the world; because in the night I have accomplished my <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> purposes. Do not urge the sun, which is now darkened on account of You, to tell the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of my heart, for no gift can I give You for the remission of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Already death is coming upon me because of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but Yours is the propitiation. Deliver me, O Lord of all, from Your fearful judgment. Do not give the enemy power to swallow me up, and to become heir of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as of that of him who is hanging on the left; for I see how the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> joyfully takes his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and his body disappears. Do not even order me to go away into the portion of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; for I see <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the patriarchs in great weeping, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> rejoicing over them. Before, then, O Lord, my spirit departs, order my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to be washed away, and remember me the sinner in Your kingdom, when upon the great most lofty throne  you shall judge the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note082041"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;19:28</a></span> For You have prepared great punishment for Your world on account of Yourself.</p>

<p>And the robber having thus spoken, Jesus says to him: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>; I say to you, Demas, that today you shall be with me in paradise. <span class="stiki" id="note082042"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;23:43</a></span> And the sons of the kingdom, the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <span class="stiki" id="note082043"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;8:11-12</a></span> And you alone shall dwell in paradise until my second appearing, when I am to judge those who do not confess my name. And He said to the robber: Go away, and tell the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> and the powers, that turn the flaming sword, that guard paradise from the time that Adam, the first created, was in paradise, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and kept not my commandments, and I cast him out thence. And none of the first shall see paradise until I am to come the second time to judge living and dead. And He wrote thus: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who have come down from the heights of the heavens, who have come forth out of the bosom of the invisible Father without being separated from Him,  and who have come down into the world to be made flesh, and to be nailed to a cross, in order that I might save Adam, whom I fashioned&mdash;to my archangelic powers, the gatekeepers of paradise, to the officers of my Father: I will and order that he who has been crucified along with me should go in, should receive remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through me; and that he, having put on an incorruptible body, should go in to paradise, and dwell where no one has ever been able to dwell.</p>

<p>And, behold, after He had said this, Jesus gave up the ghost, on the day of the preparation, at the ninth hour. And there was darkness over all the earth; and from a great earthquake that happened, the sanctuary fell down, and the wing of the temple.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p>And I Joseph begged the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and put it in a new tomb, where no one had been put. And of the robber on the right the body was not found; but of him on the left, as the form of a dragon, so was his body.</p>

<p>And after I had begged the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to bury, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, carried away by <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and rage, shut me up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, where evil-doers were kept under restraint. And this happened to me on the evening of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, whereby our nation transgressed the law. And, behold, that same nation of ours endured fearful tribulations on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>.</p>

<p>And now, on the evening of the first of the week, at the fifth hour of the night, Jesus comes to me in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, along with the robber who had been crucified with Him on the right, whom He sent into paradise. And there was a great light in the building. And the house was hung up by the four corners, and the place was opened, and I came out. Then I first recognised Jesus, and again the robber, bringing a letter to Jesus. And as we were going into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, there shone a great light, which the creation did not produce. And there was also with the robber a great fragrance out of paradise.</p>

<p>And Jesus, having sat down in a certain place, thus read: We, the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> and the six-winged, who have been ordered by Your Godhead to watch the garden of paradise, make the following statement through the robber who was crucified along with You, by Your arrangement: When we saw the print of the nails of the robber crucified along with You, and the shining light of the letter of Your Godhead,  the fire indeed was extinguished, not being able to bear the splendour of the print;  and we crouched down, being in great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For we heard that the Maker of heaven and earth, and of the whole creation, had come down from on high to dwell in the lower parts of the earth, on account of Adam, the first created. And when we beheld the undefiled cross shining like lightning from the robber, gleaming with sevenfold the light of the sun, trembling fell upon us. We felt a violent shaking of the world below;  and with a loud voice, the ministers of Hades said, along with us: Holy, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> is He who in the beginning was in the highest. And the powers sent up a cry: O Lord, You have been made manifest in heaven and in earth, bringing <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to the world; and, a greater gift than this, You have freed Your own image from death by the invisible purpose of the ages.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p>After I had beheld these things, as I was going into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> with Jesus and the robber, Jesus was transfigured, and was not as formerly, before He was crucified, but was altogether light; and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> always ministered to Him, and Jesus spoke with them. And I remained with Him three days. And no one of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> was with Him, except the robber alone.</p>

<p>And in the middle of the feast of unleavened bread, His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> John comes, and we no longer beheld the robber as to what took place. And John asked Jesus: Who is this, that You have not made me to be seen by him? But Jesus answered him nothing. And falling down before Him, he said: Lord, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that You have loved me from the beginning, and why do You not reveal to me that man? Jesus says to him: Why do you seek what is hidden? Are you still without understanding? Do you not perceive the fragrance of paradise filling the place? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who it is? The robber on the cross has become heir of paradise. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>; I say to you, that it shall belong to him alone until that the great day shall come. And John said: Make me worthy to behold him.</p>

<p>And while John was yet speaking, the robber suddenly appeared; and John, struck with astonishment, fell to the earth. And the robber was not in his first form, as before John came; but he was like a king in great power, having on him the cross. And the voice of a great multitude was sent forth: You have come to the place prepared for you in paradise. We have been commanded by Him that has sent you, to serve you until the great day. And after this voice, both the robber and I Joseph vanished, and I was found in my own house; and I no longer saw Jesus.</p>

<p>And I, having seen these things, have written them down, in order that all may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the crucified <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, and may no longer <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, but may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the signs and wonders that have happened through Him, and in order that we who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> may inherit <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and be found in the kingdom of the heavens. For to Him are due <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, strength, praise, and majesty for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
