<h1>The Nisibene Hymns</h1>

<h2>Hymn 13.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Concerning Mar Jacob and his Companions.</span> </p>

<p>1. Three illustrious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, after the manner of the two great lights&mdash;have carried on and handed down one to another, the See and the Hand and the Flock.&mdash; To us whose mounting was great for the two, this last is wholly a consolation. <em>R., Glory to You Who chose them!</em></p>

<p>2. He Who created two great lights, chose for Himself <em>these</em> three Lights,&mdash; and set them in the three dark seasons of siege that have been.&mdash; When <em>that</em> pair of Lights was quenched, the other shone wholly forth.</p>

<p>3. These three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were treasures, who held in their faithfulness,&mdash; the key of the Trinity; three doors they opened for us&mdash;each one of them with his key, unlocked and opened his door.</p>

<p>4. In the first was opened the door, for the chastisement that befell us&mdash;in the next was opened the door, for the King's power that came down on us&mdash;in the last was opened the door, for the good tidings that came up for us.</p>

<p>5. In the first was opened the door, for battle between two hosts;&mdash; in the next were opened doors, for the kings from either wind&mdash;in the last was opened the door, for ambassadors from either side.</p>

<p>6. In the first was opened the door, for battle because of misdeeds;&mdash; in the next was opened the door&mdash;for the kings because of strife&mdash;in the last was opened the door, for ambassadors because of mercies.</p>

<p>7. Lo! In these three successions, as in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> and a figure&mdash;<a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> is likened to the sun; it began under the first&mdash;it waxed strong under the next; it sank and was quenched under the last.</p>

<p>8. Three figures the Sun also, shows forth in the three quarters:&mdash; its rising <em>is</em> keen and bright; its meridian strong and overpowering&mdash;and like a torch that is burnt out, its setting <em>is</em> mild and pleasant.</p>

<p>9. Small yet bright <em>is</em> its rising, when it comes to waken sleepers&mdash;hot and overpowering its meridian, when it comes to ripen the fruits&mdash;tender and pleasant its setting, when it reaches its consummation.</p>

<p>10. Who is this daughter born of vows, enviable above all <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>&mdash;whose successions thus proceed, and her ranks are thus manifold&mdash;and her degrees thus ascend, and her teachers thus excel.</p>

<p>11. Do these similitudes belong, only to the daughter of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>&mdash;or to you too, O daughter, born of vows, whose adorning is according as your beauty?&mdash; for as your occasion, <em>so was</em> your help, and as your help <em>so was</em> its minister.</p>

<p>12. According to the measure of her need, there came to her the supply of her need.&mdash; Her fathers were as <em>was</em> her birth; her teachers were as <em>was</em> her understanding&mdash;her training as <em>was</em> her growth; her raiment as <em>was</em> her stature.</p>

<p>13. Grace weighed out <em>to her</em> and gave all these things as in the scales&mdash;she laid them in <em>her</em> balance, that therefrom there might be profit&mdash;she drew them into succession, that therefrom might be perfection.</p>

<p>14. In the days of him that <em>was</em> first, peace abounded and peace vanished&mdash;in the days of him that was next, kings came down and kings went back&mdash;but in the days of the last, hosts assailed and hosts retreated.&mdash; </p>

<p>15. By the first order came in, it came in with him and went out with him&mdash;by the next the diadem that gladdened our churches, came near and withdrew far away&mdash;but by the last there dawned on us, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that was not thankfully received.</p>

<p>16. Against the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> that was first, the labour of the first contended&mdash;against the heat that was at noon, the shade of the second stood up&mdash;against peace that was thankless, the last multiplied warnings.</p>

<p>17. For the first invader of the land <em>was</em> the first and illustrious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>&mdash;for the second invader of the land, was the second and merciful <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>:&mdash; but the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of him that was last, repaired our breaches secretly.</p>

<p>18. Nisibis is set  upon waters, waters secret and open:&mdash; living streams <em>are</em> within her; a noble river without her. The river without deceived her; the fountain within has saved her.</p>

<p>19. The first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was her vinedresser; he made her branches to grow even unto heaven.&mdash; Lo! Being dead and buried within her, he has become fruit in the midst of her bosom:&mdash; when therefore the pruners came, the fruit that <em>was</em> in her midst preserved her.</p>

<p>20. The time of her pruning came; it entered and took from her her vinedresser,&mdash; that there should not be one to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for her. She made haste in her subtlety&mdash;He laid in her bosom her vinedresser, that she should be delivered through her vinedresser.</p>

<p>21. Be wise like Nisibis, O you daughters of Nisibis,&mdash; for that she laid the body within her, and it became a wall without her.&mdash; Place within you the living body, that it be a wall for your lives!</p>

<h2>Hymn 14.</h2>

<p>1. Under the three pastors,&mdash; there were manifold shepherds&mdash;the one mother that <em>was</em> in the city&mdash;had daughters in all regions.&mdash; Since Wrath has destroyed her dwellings&mdash;Peace shall build up her churches. <em>R. Blessed be He who chose out those three!</em></p>

<p>2. The kindly labour of the first&mdash;bound up the land in her affliction:&mdash; the bread and wine of the next&mdash;healed the city when site was broken:&mdash; the sweet speech of the last&mdash;sweetened our bitterness in affliction.</p>

<p>3. The first tilled the land with his labour&mdash;he rooted out of her the briars and thorns:&mdash; the next fenced her round about&mdash;he made a hedge for her of them that were saved:&mdash; the last opened the garner of his Lord,&mdash; and sowed in her the words of her Lord.</p>

<p>4. The first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by means of a fast,&mdash; closed up the doors of <em>men's</em> mouths:&mdash; the second <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for the captives,&mdash; opened the mouths of the purse:&mdash; but the last pierced through the ears&mdash;and fastened in them the ornament of life.</p>

<p>5. <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> stripped off from the ears&mdash;the earrings and made a calf.&mdash; That lifeless calf in secret&mdash;pierced and slaughtered the camp:&mdash; those who had fashioned his horns, &mdash; he ripped them up with his horns.</p>

<p>6. But our <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <em>who was</em> the third&mdash;pierced through the ears of the heart:&mdash; and fastened <em>there</em> the earrings he had fashioned&mdash;of the nails that were fixed in the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, &mdash; whereon his Lord was crucified&mdash;and gave life to His fellow-men.</p>

<p>7. A son unto death the fire brought forth&mdash;Death feeds upon all bodies:&mdash; the son of Death who surpassed Death&mdash;upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men he fed.&mdash; The calf forsook his provender&mdash;for <em>men's</em> minds were the food for him.</p>

<p>8. To the first Tree that which killed,&mdash; to it <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> brought forth a son.&mdash; O Cross offspring of the Tree,&mdash; that fought against your sire!&mdash; The Tree was the fount of death&mdash;the Cross was the fount of life.</p>

<p>9. The son that was born to Death&mdash;all mouths were opened to curse him.&mdash; He devoured bodies and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>&mdash;and multiplied the disgrace of his father.&mdash; But the Cross caused to pass away the rebuke&mdash;of its father that first Tree.</p>

<p>10. The two sons were even as were&mdash; the <em>two</em> mothers that bare them.&mdash; The calf which the fire brought forth&mdash;the fire consumed in the midst of the people:&mdash; the Cross the offspring of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>&mdash;divided good gifts to <em>all</em> creation.</p>

<p>11. O my tongue hold your peace and be silent of the histories of the Cross that press <em>to be told!</em>&mdash; for my mind of a sudden has conceived&mdash;and lo! pangs of travail smite it:&mdash; it has conceived these among the last&mdash;and they strive to become the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>.</p>

<p>12. The babes struggled in the womb&mdash;the elder made haste to come forth:&mdash; the younger desiring the birthright&mdash;laid his hand upon his heel&mdash;that which he obtained not by birth&mdash;he obtained by the mess of pottage.</p>

<p>13. After the like sort these later histories,&mdash; lo! They make light of the former <em>ones</em>&mdash;that <em>themselves</em> may come forth and take the birthright.&mdash; Let us bring forth the history of our fathers&mdash;for lo! The histories of the Cross&mdash; <em>are</em> the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> of <em>all</em> creatures.</p>

<p>14. For if that which has no beginning&mdash; is the first of all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things&mdash;its histories also are the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>&mdash;for they are elder than <em>all</em> creatures.&mdash; Let the histories of You, O my Lord, yield place&mdash;that we may tell of Your ministers!</p>

<p>15. The first in degree of doctrine,&mdash; His eloquence was like as <em>was</em> his degree&mdash;the next who was second in degree&mdash;his interpretation mounted to the height of his degree&mdash;the last who was third in degree&mdash;his eloquence was great as he <em>was</em>.</p>

<p>16. The first in his simple words&mdash;gave milk unto his infants&mdash;the next in his plain sayings&mdash;gave victual to his children&mdash;the third in his perfect sayings&mdash;gave meat to his <em>that were</em> of perfect age.</p>

<p>17. She too the daughter of instruction&mdash;mounted from degree to degree&mdash;along with her teachers and fathers.&mdash; A young child she was with the first; a simple <em>maid</em> was she with the next&mdash;she came to perfect age in the third.</p>

<p>18. The first <em>dealing</em> with her as a child&mdash;loved her and taught her to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>&mdash;the next as with a damsel, rebuked her and make her glad&mdash;the third as with one fully instructed&mdash;was to her a solace of pleasantness.</p>

<p>19. Even the Most High with the daughter of Jacob,&mdash; <em>gave</em> blandishment and the rod to her childhood&mdash;and in her frowardness and full age&mdash;gave part in the sword and the Law;&mdash; and according to her discipline and instruction&mdash;He came to her in mildness and pleasantness.</p>

<p>20. The first that begot the flock&mdash;his bosom bare her infancy&mdash;the next of glad-some countenance,&mdash; cheered with song and made glad her childhood&mdash;the last grave of countenance,&mdash; lo! He guards <em>her</em> <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> in her youth.</p>

<p>21. The first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who begot <em>her</em>&mdash;gave milk to her infancy&mdash;the next <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> interpreted&mdash;and gave victual to her childhood&mdash;the third <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> nourished <em>her</em>, and gave meat to her perfect age.</p>

<p>22. The <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> father who <em>was</em> first&mdash;laid up treasures for her childhood&mdash;the next for her maturity&mdash; multiplied provision for her journey&mdash;the third the goodly olive tree&mdash;multiplied oil in her vessels.</p>

<p>23. When she comes before Him who is rich,&mdash; she will show the treasure of the first&mdash;when she comes before the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, she will show the saved ones of the next&mdash;when she goes forth to meet the Bridegroom,&mdash; she will show the oil of her lamps.</p>

<p>24. Before Him who rewards the weary toilworn,&mdash; she will offer the labour of the first&mdash;before Him who loves <em>cheerful</em> givers,&mdash; she will show the almsgiving of the next&mdash;before Him who judges doctrines,&mdash; she will offer the discourse of the last.</p>

<p>25. And I the sinner who have striven to be&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of these three&mdash;when they shall see Him of the Third Day&mdash;that he has closed the door of His chamber&mdash;may these three <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <em>Him</em> for me, that He keep the door <em>open</em> a little while for me!</p>

<p>26. May the sinner press into and enter&mdash; rejoicing and fearing to behold!&mdash; May the three masters call in&mdash; the one <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> in <em>their</em> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>!&mdash; May he gather up under the table&mdash; the crumbs that are full of life!</p>

<h2>Hymn 15.</h2>

<p>1. If the head had not been right&mdash;haply the members had murmured:&mdash; for when because of a perverse head&mdash; the course of the members is put astray&mdash;they are wont to lay the blame on the head. <em>R. Blessed be He who chose you the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of our people!</em></p>

<p>2. If now on one that is all goodly&mdash;on it we lay our <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>&mdash;how much <em>more</em> if we were hateful!&mdash; Yea even God though He is kind&mdash;bitter men complain against Him.</p>

<p>3. Be like the head O you members!&mdash; Get repose in his purity&mdash; and pleasantness in his tranquillity&mdash;in his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> renown&mdash;and in his wisdom learning!</p>

<p>4. Get discernment in his mildness&mdash;and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> in his gravity&mdash;and bounty in his poverty!&mdash; As he is fully and altogether fair&mdash;let us be altogether fair with him!</p>

<p>5. See how meted and weighed&mdash; are his words and his actions!&mdash; Take heed how even his steps&mdash; keep the measure of peace!&mdash; With all his might he holds the bridle of all himself.</p>

<p>6. He was master over his youth&mdash;he bound it in the yoke of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>:&mdash; his members were not enticed <em>by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a></em>&mdash;for they were kept under the rod:&mdash; his will he had in subjection.</p>

<p>7. For he was ready beforehand for his degree&mdash;as he was ready beforehand in his conversation&mdash;as he laid his foundations securely.&mdash; He became Head in his youth&mdash;when they made him preacher to the people.</p>

<p>8. Excellent was he among preachers&mdash;learned was he among scholars&mdash;and understanding was he among the wise:&mdash; chaste was he among his brethren,&mdash; and grave among his familiar friends.</p>

<p>9. In two abodes was he&mdash; a solitary recluse from <em>his early</em> days&mdash;for he was <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> within his body&mdash;and solitary within his dwelling&mdash;openly and secretly was he chaste.</p>

<p>10. But although we my brethren&mdash; have put astray those measures&mdash;and we have lost that savour,&mdash; and have become teachers to ourselves&mdash;unto the perfection that called us.</p>

<p>11. Yet that measure of Truth&mdash; preserves itself in its vessel:&mdash; <em>Truth</em> chose it because she saw it chose her&mdash;she has preserved in it her fragrance and savour,&mdash; from the beginning to the end.</p>

<p>12. The Head both chaste and grave&mdash;that was not wrathful nor hard&mdash;nor transgressed even as we <em>did</em>&mdash;set and kept his own measures&mdash;and cast a bridle on his thoughts.</p>

<p>13. He gave example in his person,&mdash; that as he kept the measure of his time,&mdash; so was it meet that we should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> our time.&mdash; We have become strangers to our time,&mdash; for we have been witless in the time of discernment.</p>

<p>14. In the beginning the blast of the wind&mdash; in its might chastens the fruit&mdash;then in the meantime the might of the sun:&mdash; but when its mightiness is passed&mdash;its end gathers his sweetness.</p>

<p>15. But we&mdash; they that were first chastened us&mdash;and also they that came next rebuked us&mdash;and they that were last added sweetness to us:&mdash; then when the time of tasting us arrives&mdash;great was our savourlessness.</p>

<p>16. For we came to maturity&mdash;that we might wean the children from wantonness&mdash;and lead them to gravity:&mdash; <em>but</em> our old age stood in need&mdash; that we should be rebuked as youths.</p>

<p>17. Accordingly he in kindness endured, nor did he make use of force&mdash;that he might increase <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to our old age:&mdash; and even if it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not its degree&mdash;let him be magnified who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> its time!</p>

<p>18. And if one say that for the multitude&mdash;force and the rod should govern it&mdash;even as for the thief <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>&mdash;and for the spoiler threatening&mdash;and for fools open shaming.</p>

<p>19. Yet if with the head as first&mdash;the members had hasted <em>to move</em> as second&mdash;they would have drawn that which was third&mdash;and the whole body from the end&mdash; would have followed after them.</p>

<p>20. They that <em>were</em> second despised those that <em>were</em> first&mdash;and that <em>were</em> third those that <em>were</em> second:&mdash; the degrees were set at naught one by another.&mdash; While these within despised one another&mdash;they were trodden down likewise by those without.</p>

<h2>Hymn 16.</h2>

<p>1. Herein <em>is</em> a mirror to be blamed&mdash;if its clearness is darkened&mdash; because there are spots on its substance;&mdash; for the foulness that is on it becomes&mdash; a covering before them that look on it. <em>R. Blessed be He Who polished our mirror!</em></p>

<p>2. For that comeliness is not adorned in it&mdash;and blemishes are not brought to view in it&mdash;it is altogether a damage to comely things&mdash;seeing that their comeliness gain not&mdash; adornments as <em>their</em> profit.</p>

<p>3. Blemishes are not rooted out by it&mdash;likewise adornments are not multiplied by it.&mdash; A blemish that remains is as a loss&mdash;that there is no adornment is a defect:&mdash; loss is met together with defect.</p>

<p>4. If our mirror <em>be</em> darkness&mdash;it is altogether <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to the hateful;&mdash; because their blemishes <em>are</em> not reproved:&mdash; but if polished and shining&mdash;it is our freedom that is adorned.</p>

<p>5. Twofold is the loss in defect&mdash;for the hateful and for the goodly&mdash;in that the goodly gain no crown&mdash;and likewise the hateful get no adorning:&mdash; the mirror divides the loss.</p>

<p>6. Never does the mirror drive&mdash; by compulsion him that looks therein:&mdash; <em>so</em> likewise <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which followed&mdash; upon the righteousness of the Law,&mdash; does not possess the compulsion of the Law.</p>

<p>7. Righteousness was unto childhood&mdash;its adorner of compulsion&mdash;for when <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> was in childhood&mdash;she adorned it by compulsion&mdash;while she <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> it not of its freedom.</p>

<p>8. Righteousness used blandishment,&mdash; and the rod <em>to deal</em> with childhood&mdash;when she smote it she roused it; her rod restrained frowardness, her blandishment softened the minds.</p>

<p> * * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>9. [If one turn from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>,] wherewith we are adorned today, my brethren,&mdash; to another gospel he is a child:&mdash; in a time of greatness of understanding&mdash;he has become without understanding.</p>

<p>10. For in the degree of full age&mdash;he has gone down to childhood&mdash;and he loves the law of bondmen,&mdash; which when he is confident smites him&mdash;and when he rejoices buffets him.</p>

<p>11. Whatsoever ornament <em>is</em> compulsion&mdash;is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> but is borrowed.&mdash; This is a great thing in God's eyes&mdash;that a man should be adorned by himself:&mdash; therefore took He away compulsion.</p>

<p>12. For even as of <em>His</em> <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>&mdash; in its <em>own</em> time He employed compulsion&mdash;so <em>likewise</em> of His <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>&mdash;He took it away at a time&mdash; when gentleness was desired in its stead.</p>

<p>13. For as it is befitting to Youth,&mdash; that it should be made to haste under the rod&mdash; <em>so</em> <em>is</em> it very hateful that under the rod&mdash; Wisdom should be brought to serve&mdash;that compulsion should be lord over her.</p>

<p>14. Behold therefore how likewise&mdash; God has ordered my successions&mdash; in the pastors I have had&mdash;and in the teachers He has given me&mdash;and in the fathers He has reckoned unto me!</p>

<p>15. For weighed out according to their times&mdash; <em>were</em> the helps of their qualities;&mdash; namely in him in whom it was needful, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; and in whom it was profitable, heartening; and in whom it was becoming, meekness.</p>

<p>16. By measure He made my steps advance:&mdash; to my childhood He assigned terror; likewise to my youth, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>&mdash;to my <em>age of</em> wisdom and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>&mdash;He assigned and gave meekness.</p>

<p>17. In the frowardness of the degree of childhood&mdash; <em>my</em> instructor was a <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to me:&mdash; his rod restrained me from wantonness&mdash;and from mischief the terror of him&mdash;and from indulgence the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of him.</p>

<p>18. Another father He gave to my youth:&mdash; what there was in me of childishness,&mdash; that was there in him of hardness; what there was in me of maturity&mdash;that was in him <em>as</em> meekness.</p>

<p>19. When I rose from the degrees&mdash; of childhood and of youth&mdash;there passed away the terror <em>that was</em> first&mdash;there passed away the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <em>that</em> <em>was</em> second&mdash;He gave me a kind pastor.</p>

<p>20. Lo! For my full age his food&mdash;and for my wisdom his interpretations;&mdash; and for my peace his meekness&mdash;and for my repose his kindness&mdash;and for my <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> his gravity!</p>
