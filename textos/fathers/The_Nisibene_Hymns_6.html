<h2>Hymn 52.</h2>

<p>Concerning <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and Death.</p>

<p>1. I heard Death and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, as they disputed, which was the more powerful, among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. <em>R., To You be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, Son of the Shepherd of All, Who delivered His flock from the secret wolves that devoured it</em>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a> and Death!&mdash; 2. Death showed his power, that he conquers all; <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> showed his guile, that he makes all to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.&mdash; 3. <em>Death</em>, To you, O Evil One, none hearkens save he that wills: to me he that wills and he that wills not, even to me they come.&mdash; 4. <em><a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a></em>, Yours, O Death, is but the force of tyranny: mine are snares and nets of subtlety.&mdash; 5. <em>D</em>., Hear, O Evil One, that who so is subtle breaks off your yoke: but none is there that is able to escape my yoke.&mdash; 6. <em>S</em>., You, Death, on him that is sick provest your might: but I over them that are whole, am exceeding powerful.&mdash; 7. <em>D</em>., The Evil One prevails not over all those that revile him: but for me he that has cursed me and he that curses me, come into my hands.&mdash; 8. <em>S</em>., You, Death, from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hast gotten your might: I alone by none am I helped, when I lead <em>men</em> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.&mdash; 9. <em>D</em>., You, O Evil-One, like a weakling: while like a king I exercise my dominion.&mdash; 10. <em>S</em>., You are a fool, O Death, not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how great am I: who suffice to capture <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, the sovereign power.&mdash; 11. <em>D</em>., You, O Evil One, like a thief, lo! You go round: I like a lion break in pieces and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not.&mdash; 12. <em>S</em>., To you, O Death, none does service or worship: to me kings do service of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> as to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.&mdash; 13. <em>D</em>., On Death there are many that call, as on a kind Power: on you, O Evil One, none has called or calls.&mdash; 14. <em>S</em>., Do you not mark this, O Death, how many there are: who in sundry fashions call on me and make oblation?&mdash; 15. <em>D</em>. Hated is your name, O <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, nor can you clear it: your name every one curses, hide your reproach.&mdash; 16. <em>S</em>., Your ear, O Death, has waxed dull, that you hear not: how against you all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> groan, conceal yourself.&mdash; 17. <em>D</em>., My face is shown to the world, for I am guileless: not like you who without guile canst not abide.&mdash; 18. <em>S</em>., You have not in anything surpassed me for it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: that you are hateful as I to the sons of men.&mdash; 19. <em>D</em>., Of me all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are afraid as of a lord: but as for you they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you as the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>.&mdash; 20. <em>S</em>., For you, O Death, they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> your name, and also your work: my name they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> but my delights they greatly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.&mdash; 21. <em>D</em>., To bitterness of teeth is turned, this your sweetness: penitence of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cleaves ever unto your <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.&mdash; 22. <em>S</em>., Sheol is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> because in her is no repentance: a pit that swallows and closes on all movements.&mdash; 23. <em>D</em>., Sheol is a gulf wherein whoso falls shall rise again: <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> because it cuts off the hope of man.&mdash; 24. <em>S</em>., Though I mislike penitents, I give place <em>for repentance</em>: you cut off hope from the sinner who dies in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.&mdash; 25. <em>D</em>., It was of you that at first his hope was cut off: for he whom you have not caused to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> dies happily.&mdash; 26. Blessed <em>is</em> He who raised against each other those cursed servants: that we might see them as they have seen us and mocked at us.&mdash; 27. This that we have seen of them is a pledge, my brethren: of what we shall see of them hereafter when we rise again.</p>

<h2>Hymn 53.</h2>

<p>1. Come, let us hear how they contend for victory: the guilty ones who never have conquered, nor will conquer.&mdash; 2. Death said unto the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>, In the end the victory is mine: for Death is master of the close, as a conqueror.&mdash; 3. <em><a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a></em>, This were to be Death indeed, were you able: to bring to death a living man, by means of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.&mdash; 4. <em>D</em>., Lo! I who behold the dead, both good and bad: the righteous who despise you, O Evil One, me they despise not.&mdash; 5. <em>S</em>., This dying of the body, is sleep for a time: think not, O Death, that you are Death, who art as a shadow.&mdash; 6. <em>D</em>., You, O Evil One, the just have conquered, yea will conquer: but these that have conquered you, lo! I conquer.&mdash; 7. <em>S</em>., Even this that you bring to death the just, is not of yourself: because of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> whom I conquered, they drink this cup.&mdash; 8. <em>D</em>., Lo! Sheol is full of the men of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>: and the giants who <em>were</em> in the flood, who is like me?&mdash; 9. <em>S</em>., These, O Death, all of them, by me were slain: I am he that caused them to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> so that they perished.&mdash; 10. <em>D</em>., Joseph who conquered you I conquered, O <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: in the chamber he conquered you but I conquered, and cast him into the tomb.&mdash; 11. <em>S</em>., <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> who conquered you, O Death, by sprinkling of blood: he conquered you in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, but at the rock, who conquered him?&mdash; 12. <em>D</em>., Elijah who feared you not, O <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: fled before <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel's</a> face, because he feared me.&mdash; 13. <em>S</em>., <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> who withstood you, O Death, with smoke of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>: to him I gave earrings of gold: and he fashioned a calf.&mdash; 14. <em>D</em>., You went down to contend with Job, and he conquered you and came up: but I, after he had conquered you, then conquered him.&mdash; 15. <em>S</em>., David who by his sackcloth stayed that pestilence: him on the house-top I conquered, who had conquered Goliath.&mdash; 16. <em>D</em>., Jehu who destroyed the house of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, the temple of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>: was unable to destroy Sheol, the stronghold of my realm.&mdash; 17. <em>S</em>., Solomon who snatched from your mouth, a child by <em>his</em> judgment: him in his old age I made a builder of idol-altars.&mdash; 18. <em>D</em>., Samuel who in <em>respect of</em> gold scorned you, O <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: him I conquered, the conqueror, who conquered <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>.&mdash; 19. <em>S</em>., Samson who in <em>respect of</em> the lion's cub, scorned you, O Death: through Delilah, frail vessel, I yoked him to the mill.&mdash; 20. <em>D</em>., Josiah from his childhood despised you, Evil One: but me not even in his old age, could he withstand.&mdash; 21. <em>S</em>., Hezekiah withstood you, Death, when he overcame the bound <em>of life</em>: I misled him and he neglected the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, and showed his treasures.&mdash; 22. <em>D</em>., John who conquered you, Evil One, and absolved and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>: I extinguished that torch, which had disclosed you.&mdash; 23. <em>S</em>., Simon overcame you, when he brought to life that blessed <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>: in a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> he overcame you and by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> I overcame him and made him deny.&mdash; 24. <em>S</em>., Apostles and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> with one voice, curse you, O Death: <q>Where is the victory of Death, and the sting of Sheol?</q>&mdash; 25. Your Lord in Sheol you have shut up, O cursed servant: God <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> you and also man, hold then your peace.&mdash; 26. <em>S</em>., It was the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him who gives life to all, that shut him in Sheol: it was you that called Him to this, when you made Adam <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.&mdash; 27. O comrade of Nabal who in the wilderness reproached his lord: abhorred be your mouth which said to Him, <q>Fall down and worship me!</q></p>

<h2>Hymn 54.</h2>

<p>1. Hear, O Freedom, the dispute of two servants: how they are convicted by each other, that they are powerless.&mdash; 2. <em>R., To You be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by Whose humiliation <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was exalted: and by Whose death he was raised, and regained <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a>!</em>&mdash; 3. If then the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a> overcome you, great is the shame: Death his comrade has convicted him, as being weak.&mdash; 4. And if again Death subdue you, lo! What reproach: for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a> his comrade derides him, as but a shadow.&mdash; 5. Their dispute is for you a mirror, wherein you may see: that they both are but as chaff, before your breath.&mdash; 6. Yea and Prophets and Apostles, in their promises: assure you that they like flowers, shall fade at the rising.&mdash; 7. <em>S</em>., You, Death, art he whom they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, the quick and dead: for every combination you dissolve, and destroy.&mdash; 8. <em>D</em>., It is not open death that kills, O <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: your death which is secret kills the sons of men.&mdash; 9. <em>S</em>., My name is not hateful as yours, for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>: showed himself in <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan's</a> likeness to Balaam on the way.&mdash; 10. <em>D</em>., How fit is this your name, O <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: who has erred and made unwary Adam <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, from the way!&mdash; 11. <em>S</em>., Wander not like one <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and lose your <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: dispute, O Death, if you are competent, for replying.&mdash; 12. <em>D</em>., I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are wily, O <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: so that you out of sand can twist a snare.&mdash; 13. <em>S</em>., Your disputing, Death, is ended: for he who is worsted: when his words fail and are ended, begins to rail.&mdash; 14. <em>D</em>., Among all I am conqueror, and by you am I worsted? Let <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> persuade you whom I have overcome, O <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>!&mdash; 15. <em>S</em>., I am he who bound Adam, and cast him before you: the mighty man whom my wiles had bound, you came and subdue.&mdash; 16. <em>D</em>., I am he who have been crowned anew, with a diadem in the world: for Adam, chief of the mighty, I hold captive in Sheol.&mdash; 17. <em>S</em>., I killed him by secret death, even <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>: you, Death, hast slain one that was dead, killed by me.&mdash; 18. <em>D</em>., In your desire to conquer, Evil One, you have made yourself <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>: for you are Death as well as <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, and this <em>seems</em> a little thing to you.&mdash; 19. <em>S</em>., You have then been silenced, Death, as a weakling: for neither in words nor in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, have you strength to stand.&mdash; 20. <em>D</em>., It is for your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> you conquer, O Evil One, if you discern, your crown is wholly of shame, if you perceive.&mdash; 21. I shall be defeated and you shall be cursed, O <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: it is well for me to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and not mischievous.&mdash; 22. Blessed be the Just One who divided them, though they were quite of one mind: Blessed be the Good One who made us of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, when we were divided.&mdash; 23. I will overcome the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a> through Your forgiveness, O All-Merciful: and I shall overcome death through Your Resurrection, O All-Life-giver!</p>

<h2>Hymn 55.</h2>

<p>1. Lo! The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a> reproached Death, and was in turn reproached: from each and to each and against each, <em>were</em> their taunts.&mdash; 2. <em>R., To You be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, Son of the Lord of All, Who died for all: for He was raised to give life to all, in the day of His Coming!</em>&mdash; 3. <em>S</em>., Jonah who conquered you, and returned back from Sheol, became my advocate <em>in asking</em>, why sinners were spared?&mdash; 4. <em>D</em>., Slander not, O Evil One, the son of Amittai: he showed a face of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, that they might praise you more.&mdash; 5. <em>S</em>., Quite powerless is all your persuasion, O tyrant Death: for there pleases me nothing, of all you have said.&mdash; 6. <em>D</em>., For when was the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> pleasing to you? A gulf is between you and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfulness</a>, O lying one.&mdash; 7. I am righteous all my days, with nought to repent: I am he that rescues from you the sons of men.&mdash; 8. <em>S</em>., Proclaim your repentance, Death, you are well come: lo! Saul also among the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, great <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of scorn.&mdash; 9. If you, Death, be justified, then for myself: I cut not off hope, likewise, of repentance.&mdash; 10. <em>D</em>., No idol with my Lord have I made, O hater of your Lord! lo! You by dead <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, slay the living.&mdash; 11. <em>S</em>., That you, Death, art half of me, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and I half of you: if half of me repents, it repents, but I marvel.&mdash; 12. <em>D</em>., Your partner am I in share, but not in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: mine are the slain and yours the slayers, whom you made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.&mdash; 13. <em>S</em>., My craftiness weeps for itself, when I dispute with you: my wiles mourn over me, when I meet you.&mdash; 14. <em>D</em>., Workers of <a href="../cathen/15674b.htm">witchcraft</a> and soothsayers, with all <em>their</em> offenses: the fire that you kindled in the world, in Sheol I have quenched.&mdash; 15. <em>S</em>., You penitent who strainest out gnats, and swallowest the just: the chaste shall rend you, who cry, from within your belly.&mdash; 16. <em>D</em>., It is the treasure-house <em>where</em> I keep all the righteous: their resurrection threatens <em>ill</em> to you, who persecuted them.&mdash; 17. <em>S</em>., The greedy one who carries all creatures, in his bowels: lo! He casts up to me that I am <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a>, of my possessions.&mdash; 18. <em>D</em>., Before the stroke lament not, for it has not <em>yet</em> reached <em>you</em>: the day will come when you shall cry out, and I shall hear and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>.&mdash; 19. The fire will come that shall strip off you your very skin: as by the potsherd you stripped the skin of Job.&mdash; 20. <em>D</em>., The savour of sloth begins, as if to hover on me; it is then a dream that I ceased, for a short space.&mdash; 21. It was not that words failed me, and therefore I was silent: it is for the time I grieve, that has passed idly.&mdash; 22. The hurt <em>done</em> by your speech is very great: would I had not heard it! For my whole mind is intent upon my work.&mdash; 23. This humankind that is lost, was undone by wandering thought: slothfulness, with negligence, brought it under yoke.&mdash; 24. The <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of desire bid for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and bought it: contention with boastfulness, were the sureties.&mdash; 25. With persistence for strength, I wage my <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>: and if I neglect but a little, my sway is naught.&mdash; 26. By continual dropping, I clean the rocks: for continual dropping can dissolve even a mountain.&mdash; 27. Habit even over nature, becomes master: it trains and leads even lions, as beasts of burden.&mdash; 28. Habit, repose, and increase, with persistence; by these is freedom conquered, though stubborn above all.&mdash; 29. If its will be firmly set, it breaks the fetters; but if lax, a fragile net, can capture it.&mdash; 30. If so be that Freedom shouts, we are scattered: but if she be silent we gather together, to mock at her.&mdash; 31. Let us cease from much speaking, lest it lead to much sloth: with one mind let us assail the wall, and lo! It is broken down.&mdash; 32. <em>S</em>., Go and see to diseases, and I to snares: for to me <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and to you pestilences, are great solace.&mdash; 33. And even though I have paused, I have not paused from my cares: for my will at no time rests, but is ready.</p>

<h2>Hymn 56.</h2>

<p>1. With Freedom is your struggle, O Evil One: it can cast on you a muzzle, if it so please.&mdash; 2. <em>R</em>., <em>To You be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in whose</em>  <em>victory we have gained strength: and in whose resurrection we defy even Death itself!&mdash; </em>3. Lo! Again these two exposed each other, how weak both are: Death reminded the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a> of your mightiness (<em>O Freedom</em>).&mdash; 4. Your fire is in your nest, O Death, and you perceive not: the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of the departed, to you is overthrow.&mdash; 5. Lo! Death and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a> proclaim your mightiness (<em>O Freedom</em>): yea, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a> calls to mind your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.&mdash; 6. If then these that were against you are on your side: this is a great thing that your persecutors have become your heralds&mdash;7. <em>D</em>., I confess, O Evil One, that as <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>: I lay up the King's treasures, till His Coming.&mdash; 8. <em>S</em>., I, O Death, rather deny that this belongs to God: this treasure of subtlety, which I have stored.&mdash; 9. <em>D</em>., Your coinage is fraudulent, then, O <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: that into the treasuries of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is not received.&mdash; 10. <em>S</em>., A new coinage do I coin, in kingly wise: lo! My merchantmen bring loss, into the world.&mdash; 11. God created everything out of nothing: and I created great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> out of nothing&mdash; 12. <em>D</em>., Closed and bound be your mouth, Evil One, who art thus bold: to set yourself, lo! In comparison with the Creator.&mdash; 13. <em>S</em>., To me, O Death, it is lawful to dare and speak: your tongue, even yours, is a slave, and under <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.&mdash; 14. <em>D</em>., A gulf is henceforth between us, O <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: for madly against your Lord, lo! You assail.&mdash; 15. <em>S</em>., Wherefore do you doubt, O Death, of our concord? Be to us comrade and member: and lo! We reign.&mdash; 16. Come, draw we our pair of swords, against <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>: I secretly, you openly, and lo! We end them.&mdash; 17. Sin and Sheol they too gave counsel to those two: saying <q>If you be divided, you are undone.</q>&mdash; 18. See the waters how if dispersed, they run low: but if gathered they gain strength, and thus you likewise.&mdash; 19. If divided you perish, as the feeble: but yoked together you reign, as the mighty.&mdash; 20. Love melts down many, as in a furnace: and makes one powerful mass, that overcomes all.&mdash; 21. In it are wisdom and cunning, and force and power: it is greater far than an image of sixty cubits.&mdash; 22. Be reconciled, let us assemble and go, against that party: which if it be at one can never be defeated.&mdash; 23. These things the troublers discoursed, and gathered and came: Your day, Lord, will gather them, into Gehenna.&mdash; 24. Through Your mercy, Lord, will I worship You, when I have risen: at Your trumpet I will praise Your Son, when I am purged.</p>

<h2>Hymn 57.</h2>

<p>1. Listen, my brethren, to Death, mocking the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>: that caused the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">head of our race</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and its <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">mother</a>.&mdash; 2. <em>R., To You be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that by Your humiliation, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> is subdued: and that Your abasement has exalted Adam, who was abased.</em>&mdash; 3. <em>D</em>., Your great nakedness shall be seen, by the sons of Adam; as you mocked his nakedness, when you made him <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.&mdash; 4. Eve will cease from that serpent, and rail at you: for you, O Dragon, wast he that beguiled her simpleness.&mdash; 5. Abel will see him, even, Cain, who has come to you: the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> will blame his cursed master.&mdash; 6. <em>S</em>., <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> who conquered the flood, as it were death: by the mouth of Ham I laughed at, when wine overcame him.&mdash; 7. <em>D</em>., <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> was not harmed, but your garment, wherewith you clothed him: even cursings, he put on, and became a slave.&mdash; 8. <em>S</em>., <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> who overcame <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> which is, your likeness, Death: to his daughters I gave such counsels, as were pleasing to me.&mdash; 9. <em>D</em>., And <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> wife who was your vessel hearkened, to your counsel: may half of you be dried up, as your whole vessel was dried up!&mdash; 10. Gehenna be overturned, upon your head: as your <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> overturned <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, its dwellers!&mdash; 11. Floods of fire be stirred against you, in the resurrection: who against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elijah, stirred the people!&mdash; 12. Let the just mock you at the last, and Joseph <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>! Whose brethren mocked him, set on by you!&mdash; 13. Let vapour of smoke come in, and choke your senses: as the waters of the sea choked, the senses of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>! &mdash; 14. Let chaste <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also mock you, by whose counsel: the daughters of Midian mocked, the foolish people!&mdash; 15. Flame be kindled on your head, for Samson's sake: for by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> you shaved his locks, that lion of strength!&mdash; 16. <em>S</em>., Saul whom I conquered by <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, by <a href="../cathen/15674b.htm">witchcraft</a> conquered you: for he asked for and brought up Samuel, out of his grave.&mdash; 17. <em>D</em>., Slander not the living dead, for he came not up: you were he that came up in the phantom for you were worthy.&mdash; 18. Let the commandment hang you over the flame, you Evil One! For by you they hanged Absalom, upon a tree.&mdash; 19. In the fire may you see yourself humbled, among vile <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>! For Solomon by you was degraded, among profane <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.&mdash; 20. Justice be measured to you, as you inflamed her! even <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel</a> who devoured the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, you kindled her.&mdash; 21. In fire may you <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> burn, who made them drunken! The two whom Elijah burnt up, when they went up and assailed <em>him</em>.&mdash; 22. On you also be coals heaped! May he see and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>: that Naboth in whom you heaped a pile of stones!&mdash; 23. Be clad in scorn in the day of judgment, before all beholders! Who clothed Gehasi in a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, by means of your theft.&mdash; 24. With lightning for a dart be pierced, O <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>! Who in the heart of Josiah, fixed <em>your</em> darts.&mdash; 25. Sink in the dregs of Gehenna, O <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>! Who sank Jeremiah in the mire of the pit.&mdash; 26. Daniel escaped from the pit, whither you cast him: may he have comfort in seeing you, in the furnace for ever!&mdash; 27. Be your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> returned on your head, Hater of man: as his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> was returned on the head, of Haman your fellow! &mdash; 28. May the King's Bride mock you, as did Esther: when you beseech her in the judgment-day, to plead for you!&mdash; 29. Fire released the righteous ones, whom you had bound: a mighty bond be to you, the flame of fire!&mdash; 30. Be torn in sunder, and may the seven brothers, see your defeat: the sons of Shemuni who by your wolves, were torn in sunder!&mdash; 31. May fire triumph over your pate, as you mocked: the two heads of Nazarites, sons of the barren!&mdash; 32. May fire make mock of your head, for mother and daughter: triumphed over John's head, when you maddened them!&mdash; 33. Flame triumphed over your head, O Evil One: for on the charges you triumphed, over John's head!</p>

<h2>Hymn 58.</h2>

<p>1. Lo! Death was prompt beforehand, to mock <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: him who was doomed to become a mockery at the last.&mdash; 2. <em>R., Glory to You Who by Your crucifixion, conquered the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>: and by Your resurrection gain victory, likewise over Death!</em>&mdash; 3. And for our Lord's sake Death spoke curses on him: who was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His shame, and crucifixion.&mdash; 4. <em>D</em>., The fiery pit be your grave, O <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: who blasphemed the Voice from the grave, that rent the graves&mdash; 5. My Lord I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and the Son of my Lord, O you <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>! You have denied your Lord, and crucified the Son of your Lord.&mdash; 6. This is the name that fits you, <q>Slayer of your Lord</q>: when He appears Whom you slew, He shall slay you.&mdash; 7. At you shall every one shake the head, for by you the chiefs: shook their heads at Him, the Lord of life.&mdash; 8. A bruised reed under the feet, of the just shall you be: for through you they put a reed in His hand, Who upholds all.&mdash; 9. With a crown of thorns was He crowned, to signify: that He took the diadem of the kingdom, of the house of David.&mdash; 10. With a crown of thorns was He crowned, the King of kings: but He took the diadem of the king, of those that shamed him.&mdash; 11. In the robes of mockery that they gave him, in those He mocked <em>them</em>: for He took the raiment of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and kings.&mdash; 12. To vinegar is your memory akin, O you <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: who offered vinegar for the thirst, of the Fount of Life.&mdash; 13. The hand shall every man lift against you who strengthened the hand that smote Him by Whose hand, all creatures stand.&mdash; 14. He was smitten by the hand and He cut off the hand, of <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>: the hand of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is cut off, in the cutting off of the unction.&mdash; 15. On the pillar again they stretched Him, as for scourging: Him Whose pillar went before, to <em>guide</em> their tribes.&mdash; 16. The pillar on the pillar, He was scourged: He removed Himself from out of Zion, and its fall came.&mdash; 17. When they put two beams together, to form the Cross: He broke them, even the two staves, the guardians of them.&mdash; 18. Ezekiel put together the sticks, the two in one: in the two beams of the Cross, their staves have ceased.&mdash; 19. The two sticks, as it were wings, bore the people: lo! His two staves were broken, even as his wings.&mdash; 20. The bosom and wings of the Cross, He opened in mercy: its pinions bowed and bore the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, to go to <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a>.&mdash; 21. It is akin to the Tree of Life, and unto the son of its stock: it leads its beloved that on its boughs, they may feed on its fruits.&mdash; 22. Go howl and weep, Evil One, for me and for you: for not one of us shall enter the <q>Garden of Life.</q>&mdash; 23. <em>S</em>., Now that you have confessed O Death, come let me tell you: that all this discourse of yours, to me is idle talk.&mdash; 24. I will go and watch the snares, which I have set: you too, Death, fly and look after, all that are sick.&mdash; 25. Our Lord has brought both to nought, on either hand: the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a> shall be brought to nought here, and Death hereafter there.</p>

<h2>Hymn 59.</h2>

<p>1. Lo! Death for us on <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, inflicts vengeance: come let us hear his shame and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, for he rejoiced in our shame.&mdash; 2. <em>R., To You be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from Your flock, from You: are subdued both Death and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, under Your Feet!</em>&mdash; 3. <em>D</em>., Evil ones shall be hung upright, but you, head downward: for, reversely, you crucified Simon on the tree.&mdash; 4. <em>S</em>., Touching all else I am silent, Death, for my time wanes: Simon himself conjured me, <q>Crucify me thus.</q>&mdash; 5. Were it the just that cursed me, I had not grieved: the curse of Death unto me, is worse than <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.&mdash; 6. <em>D</em>., The shame of our Lord I have not spoken of, it is too great for my mouth: that I should weigh and compare His Passion, with Your torment.&mdash; 7. Twelve <em>judgment</em> thrones shall He set, for His Twelve: for by the twelve tribes you, even you, shall be condemned.&mdash; 8. A halter unbought shall you hang you, O you <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: as that Your <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> hung him, a halter for a price.&mdash; 9. Haply yon <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> in mercy, shall be emptied: and you shall dwell there alone, with Your ministers.&mdash; 10. Manifold are Your curses, and how shall I count <em>them</em>? Lo! The sum of all your curses, is on your members.&mdash; 11. The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the fire shall stab you, who made them <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: they shall upbraid you <q>why did you bring us here?</q>&mdash; 12. Sinners shall rail against you, and haply their threats: shall be worse to you than the torment, of yonder <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.&mdash; 13. These shall be unto you there, all of them Satans: as you have been to them here, the one <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>.&mdash; 14. The Watchers shall seize and hurl you down, calling to mind: how through you men hurled their Lord, from the height to the depth.&mdash; 15. All men will run to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> you, not forgetting that through you the maddened people ran, to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> their Maker.&mdash; 16. On you, Evil One, from all mouths <em>shall be</em>, the spitting of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>: for through you they spat on Him Whose spittle, gave sight to the blind.&mdash; 17. On you, Evil One, from all tongues, shall be all curses: for through you men <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> Him, Who opened dumb mouths.&mdash; 18. Blessed <em>is</em> He Who avenged our wrong, though in silence: and stirred up Death against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>, to fall upon him!&mdash; 19. Sound we Hosannas, my brethren, as <em>did</em> Gideon: <span class="stiki" id="note370353"><a href="../bible/jdg007.htm#verse18">Judges&nbsp;7:18-22</a></span> who when he sounded, the oppressors, fell on one another!</p>

<h2>Hymn 60.</h2>

<p>1. O what amazement befell the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>, of a sudden, my brethren: when the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was corrected, and gained Wisdom!&mdash; 2. <em>R., Glory to the One Who alone, conquered the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>; and to Him yea Him be also confession, Who vanquished Death!</em>&mdash; 3. The Evil One marvelled <q>Where <em>is</em> her laughter? Where her perfumes? Where her dancing and outward ornament, and inward <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>?</q>&mdash; 4. Instead of that light laughter, she is given up to tears: She has cut off her hair to wipe the dust, off the feet of Jesus.&mdash; 5. Naught lasts in her of any doctrine, nor abides in her: from our instruction she has escaped and cast away, all that I taught her.&mdash; 6. She has denied us and our acquaintance, and even as though: she had never seen me she has blotted my image, out of her mind.&mdash; 7. The living leaven of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> flew to her, Jesus was silent: but she made bold to press and enter, though none called her.&mdash; 8. She forgot our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <em>many</em> years, and in the twinkling of an eye: from between me and her she removed <em>it, and</em> set Death <em>there</em>.&mdash; 9. For instead of laughter weeping delights her, and instead of paint: a shower of tears, and instead of ornament, a sad countenance.&mdash; 10. Zaccheus I made chief of extortioners, and her I made: chief of wantons; my two wings, Jesus has broken.&mdash; 11. If so be Zaccheus becomes <em>his</em> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, and if so be she: becomes <em>his</em> hearer, henceforth they fetter, my craftiness.&mdash; 12. Carved images henceforth are a mockery and the carvers: a derision, and the worshippers a laughing-stock.&mdash; 13. I shut <em>men's</em> eyes that they might not perceive, that they are carved images: Jesus opens their eyes to see that they are the works of <em>men's hands</em>.&mdash; 14. If Jesus has chosen for Himself preachers, then our preaching: whereof the whole world is full, is put to silence.&mdash; 15. For lo! The Chaldeans with the soothsayers, and lo! The wizards: with the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a> they are smitten and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, with all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ones!&mdash; 16. You <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are ended and have given up the Ghost from henceforth, depart you <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>! Become husbandmen, the Chaldeans likewise, shall close their books.&mdash; 17. If the Hebrews have become His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who by all <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>: were not subdued, who of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, shall not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> him?&mdash; 18. If he begins to set straight the reverse, He brings to naught our speech: henceforth He will not hesitate against us, He who rebukes all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.&mdash; 19. In that I was worshipped in all temples, our disgrace is greater: than our <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> <em>was</em>, for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> spit, upon our altars.&mdash; 20. Flesh of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> becomes abhorred, into fragments: <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> are <em>broken</em>, and carven images burn, under their pots.&mdash; 21. All our work becomes a laughing-stock, and a ruin: all that we have built, and a mockery, all that we have taught.&mdash; 22. The secret <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> that I taught them, laboriously: are about to be spread abroad, on the housetops.&mdash; 23. Of the Egyptians I was more <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, than of any nation: for they used to worship even, the onions and garlic.&mdash; 24. Lo! I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest even here, where delusion was so great: <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall prevail that there exceedingly, Jesus may reign.&mdash; 25. And if when He was an infant, and fled and went down, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> marvelled: yea lulled him&mdash; this strangler of babes, loved their Babe.&mdash; 26. Was it a pledge He went down to give her, as a betrother: giving assurance that when of full age, He will also take her <em>to wife</em>?&mdash; 27. <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> cannot set his foot <em>firm</em>, for this is no stammerer: that he should deceive Him, and no bondman, that he should lie unto Him.&mdash; 28. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> smote and the Egyptians rebelled, and he chastised the people: and the Hebrews rebelled&mdash; Jesus is smitten, and gives life to all.&mdash; 29. This is hard <em>to understand</em> that not by force; lays He His yoke: on the rebellious: He was rebuked, and He instructs others.&mdash; 30. The spittle of His mouth, wiped off and took away, the shame of Adam: by the smiting of His cheeks, He rooted out our wrathfulness, from His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.&mdash; 31. By the nails which he received, He made me to suffer. I rejoiced when I crucified Him: and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that He was crucifying me, in His crucifixion.</p>

<h2>Hymn 61.</h2>

<p>1. In wisdom let us hearken to Death, O my beloved: how he accuses us for our weeping, and for our mourning.&mdash; 2. <em>R., To you be praise Who came down, to follow Adam: and foundest <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and also in the children of Adam.</em>&mdash; 3. And rightly perhaps  he says, <q>You slay: without mercy and lo! You weep, as though merciful.</q>&mdash; 4. You have made me as a cruel one, O you murderers: for you slay one another, without my help!&mdash; 5. While Death was <em>but</em> desiring to come, the sword came before him: let us see then against whom cries out, the blood of the slain.&mdash; 6. Against you cry out the strangled, who were suffocated: for it shames me of the rope, of their strangulations.&mdash; 7. They take away from me even my rest, for without me: how could the strangled and the slain, enter Sheol?&mdash; 8. Lo! Your infants are cast out, as those in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>: your sons have you <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, O <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniacs</a>!&mdash; 9. While Death was <em>but</em> desiring to taste, of your corpses: Cain refreshed me beforehand, with blood of man.&mdash; 10. While I was but desiring to wait patiently, till <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> should die: before I had power you gave me power, over your bodies.&mdash; 11. Cain with his sword overthrew, the gate of Sheol: for it was closed and before the time, he first opened it.&mdash; 12. He by treading made the way of Sheol, without my help: for in the way you have trodden out for me, lo! I walk <em>therein</em>.&mdash; 13. Nine hundred years I sat and waited, for <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to die: but Cain not even a day, endured his brother.&mdash; 14. Robbers upon the highways, are worse than I: I am slumbering while they, are watching to slay.&mdash; 15. Lo! Your slaughtered in the graves, and your murdered in your ways; and your strangled upon your stakes!&mdash; 16. <q>If I rebelled against my lord, yea and slew him: who was he that slew these here,</q> said Jehu.&mdash; 17. And if I Death have taken, your departed: the strangled, the slain, and the slaughtered, who was it slew them?&mdash; 18. You are <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> to each other, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a> is abhorred: you are pestilence to each other, and Death is blamed!&mdash; 19. Your <em>own</em> will to you is <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, yea and a murderer: but of Death and of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> complain.&mdash; 20. Poison of Death you give also to drink, each to other: lo! How many Deaths have you, beside me.&mdash; 21. Wiles, stratagems, yea and snares, sword and poison: how many Deaths from you and in you, lo! Are there born.&mdash; 22. The judge in the judgment-hall, is a second Death: he slays for secret reward, but I for naught.&mdash; 23. I have seen <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribery</a> and marvelled at it, that ran and outran me: how many slain does <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribery</a>, slay, and none perceives!&mdash; 24. I am ashamed that <em>so</em> unskilfully, I conduct myself: if I take even one corpse, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> perceive <em>it</em>.&mdash; 25. In the houses weeping and in the streets, also wailing: and even unto the gates of Sheol, they groan over me.&mdash; 26. Groan over yourselves that you are thus hateful, and you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> me: Sheol henceforth shall groan over you, O murderers!&mdash; 27. With torture, scourging and fire, yea with <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoning</a>: you <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and you are <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>!&mdash; 28. I am more modest than you and merciful, also reverent: for with reverence I bear away, your departed.&mdash; 29. On the bed I deal gently, with him that is sick: and quietly I lay him to sleep, for <em>but</em> a while.</p>

<h2>Hymn 62.</h2>

<p>1. Lo! Death, the King of silence, complains, my brethren: that we have filled his abode with the wailing, of Hope cut off.&mdash; 2. <em>R., To Him be great praise Who came   down to us here below: and suffered and rose again and in His Body, raises our bodies!</em>&mdash; 3. While we weep like madmen, at the gates of Sheol: hearken what Death says, reproaching us.&mdash; 4. It shames me, says Death, that you, have overcome me: the half of Sheol suffices not, to contain your slain.&mdash; 5. For alien corpses together, lie heaped in Sheol: there are two divisions there, the dead, the slain.&mdash; 6. Whereas I should complain that you have wronged me, lo! You are weeping: you have burst the gate of Sheol, and done me hurt.&mdash; 7. For you are like an infant, which while yet weeping: laughs again as you also, over your dead.&mdash; 8. For there is no discretion in your mourning, and no understanding: in your laughter&mdash; for to me you seem like, to a weaned babe.&mdash; 9. One hour weeping and wailing, and after a little: both jesting and wantonness, as of children.&mdash; 10. For you are unable to become, perfect men: that weep not yea and laugh not, as the discreet.&mdash; 11. Touching your books we are grieved, that they have toiled over them: who should read them unto you, <em>even</em> the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>.&mdash; 12. The readers are crying aloud, for you are deaf: this <em>their</em> crying proves concerning you, that you are <em>as</em> stocks.&mdash; 13. For since the reader and the interpreter, are crying aloud: your ears therefore are heavy, or else your hearts.&mdash; 14. For if there were <em>with you</em> an ear, <em>open</em> to persuasion: it were meet to hear little, and to do much.&mdash; 15. But because <em>its</em> hearing is closed, whoso knocks at it: the voice returns back to him, who sent it forth.&mdash; 16. There is no crying with me of mine, I am not deaf: none that reads or interprets <em>for me</em>, I am not dull.&mdash; 17. The breath that is from Him commands me, <em>sons</em> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: and with the command there follows, also the fulfilment.&mdash; 18. With me is no holding back, no turnings aside: I know no arrow even, could outstrip me.&mdash; 19. But your voices are scorned by me, when you are weeping: over the graves of your departed, in the cutting off of hope.&mdash; 20. Were it possible or permitted, when you are weeping: I would go forth and tell <em>you</em>, to your faces.&mdash; 21. <q>I am endeavouring to give, an account of the death: and your voices disturb me, that I <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in my count.</q>&mdash; 22. You nations, let not your understanding, become childish: like that nation whose intelligence, was never great.&mdash; 23. In which <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> bestows not itself, as in a fool: for its thoughts are darkness, without discernment.&mdash; 24. For your infants and your sons, in the resurrection: they shall be foremost to come forth, as the first fruits&mdash; 25. Then after them <em>shall come</em> the just, as victorious: last shall come forth the sinner, as put to shame.&mdash; 26. For although in the twinkling of an eye, they be quickened: yet is it in order that their ranks, come forth from Sheol.&mdash; 27. Prophets come forth and Apostles, and <em><a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a></em> Fathers: following them in due array, according to command.&mdash; 28. Lo! That which now is sown, in random mixture: is yielded back in great order, as garden-herbs.&mdash; 29. For though one in the sowing, should mix all seeds: that which is earlier than its fellow, prevents its fellow&mdash;30. And not as their going down was confused, so disordered shall be: their coming up from the earth, for its order is fixed.&mdash; 31. Lo! I have been against myself, in what I have said: for secret things which you comprehended not, from me you have learned.&mdash; 32. Instead of the tears that profit not, which are at the tomb: pour them forth in <em>your</em> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.&mdash; 33. For to the dead there is profit in these, and likewise to the living: weep not with a weeping that afflicts, both dead and living!</p>

<h2>Hymn 63.</h2>

<p>1. Who shall weigh the recompense of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>? Whom I marvelled at when he bound, his only son.&mdash; 2. <em>R., To you be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, Voice that bringest to life the dead in Sheol: and they have come up as preachers, of His Son Who quickens all!</em>&mdash; 3. At that time I came forth in haste, to see the marvel: how that his knife was drawn out, against his beloved.&mdash; 4. I gathered my manifold memories, from all quarters: and I collected my spirit to marvel, at that illustrious one.&mdash; 5. How therefore can you read, that great story? You have despised the reading of it, in your very ears.&mdash; 6. The sword of Jephthah rebukes, him that laments: his daughter was to him a mirror of life from the dead.&mdash; 7. She gave herself for her father, so commend ye: your life to the Father of all, in the hope of <em>your</em> end.&mdash; 8. In the womb then did you not make trial, of a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Sheol? Yet in Sheol you had more rest, than in the womb.&mdash; 9. It is stubborn in you to stand up against, my mighty will: for lo! To succour them I take away, your departed.&mdash; 10. By the king of Moab who slew, his son with his hands: he is put to shame who laments, for the departed one.&mdash; 11. He was a profane man, lo! According, to what you read: but you are doctors and teachers, as you suppose.&mdash; 12. He endured, but you are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a>, in your mourning: against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord of all, while you are weeping.&mdash; 13. I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> however to let pass, the story of Job: through this feeble mouth of mine, for I am unworthy.&mdash; 14. So in like manner I turn aside, from <em>mention</em> of their bones: though I praise Him who granted, that they should come to me.&mdash; 15. Dishonour not your members, by your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: for in Sheol the bones are despised, of evildoers.&mdash; 16. Whenever I see the body of one of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: I trample on it and curse, even his memory.&mdash; 17. But wherever I see a bone, of one of the just; I set it apart and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> it, and do it worship.&mdash; 18. You feeble ones understand not, all my ordinances: with you orders are confused, for you are blind.&mdash; 19. It is <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> alone that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, to have honoured like me: the bones of that Joseph whom I magnify.&mdash; 20. But <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, to one pure body: but I to the body and the bones, of all the righteous.&mdash; 21. Brightly shine the bones of Prophets, and of Apostles: a lamp to me in darkness, are all the righteous.&mdash; 22. I worship Him Who lightens for me, the darkness of Sheol: the splendour of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> who was so great, was as the sun to me.</p>

<h2>Hymn 64.</h2>

<p>1. O feeble ones, why do you weep over your dead: who in death are at rest from sorrows and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>?&mdash; 2. <em>R., Glory to Him Who endured all, for the sake of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: yea tasted death for the sake of all, to bring all to life</em>&mdash; 3. I reveal unto you, that even <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, though much content: at your weeping, yet laughs much, at your mourning.&mdash; 4. In mockery he winks at me and nods to me, as a jester: <q>Come let us laugh at sinners, for lo! They are mad.</q>&mdash; 5. Truly they have given up remembrance of that fire, which I have hidden for them: and lo! The fools are drunken with weeping, for their departed.&mdash; 6. Instead of weeping as though, without provision: I had plundered and sent forth their dead, lo! They are mad.&mdash; 7. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are to be afflicted, till the judgment day: and these weep over the graves, like to madmen.&mdash; 8. They care not for their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that haply tomorrow: they must go in shame of face, to join their dead.&mdash; 9. And thus shall all be put to shame alike, <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> by <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>: in Sheol the wretches shall repent without avail.&mdash; 10. Leave the drunken and the madman, until that day: wherein <em>each</em> shall shake off his wine wherewith he was maddened.&mdash; 11. I will go to gather them, like children: that they may play the wanton and the madman, until they perish.&mdash; 12. Lo! I have revealed to you the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, the secret of my comrade: go forth therefore, depart, amend, in repentance.&mdash; 13. Leave me, I too will depart, I will see to my affairs: that with open face I may give my account to my Lord.&mdash; 14. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the wind as it blew, has borne away my words: for you are the same whom I, ofttimes have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>.&mdash; 15. I remember Jeremiah how he, compared boldness: to the Indian who changes not <em>his skin</em>, though it is of freedom.&mdash; 16. For this too belongs to it, even to freedom: that it binds itself by the will, as though by nature.&mdash; 17. For so powerful is the will, in them that are free: that it may be likened to nature, through its workings. </p>

<h2>Hymn 65.</h2>

<p>1. <em>Man</em>, O Death, despise it not, that image of Adam: which like a seed is committed to earth, till the Resurrection.&mdash; 2. <em>R., To you be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> Who descended and plunge, after Adam: and draw him out from the depths of Sheol, and bring him into <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a>!</em>&mdash; 3. <em>Death</em>, I marvel at this seed, and at your words: for lo! After five thousand years, it springs not yet.&mdash; 4. <em>M.</em>, Its present state passes away, as winter <em>does</em>: and as a handful of <em>grain</em> it comes in the resurrection, to the garner of life.&mdash; 5. <em>D</em>., That there is vintage-time, lo! I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but I have not seen: the dead at any time sown, or yet reaped.&mdash; 6. <em>M</em>., There is coming a reaping, O Death, that will leave you bare: and the Watchers shall go forth as reapers, and make you desolate.&mdash; 7. <em>D</em>., When did I become husbandman, instead of vine-dresser? Who has turned Sheol the wine-press, into a tilled field?&mdash; 8. <em>M</em>., Does not the seed then teach you, which decays and dies: and <em>is</em> cut off from hope, yet from the rain, recovers hope?&mdash; 9. <em>D</em>., A dream have you seen you feeble ones, of life from the dead: for in waking time the resurrection, you do not see.&mdash; 10. <em>M</em>., Your drowsiness hinders you, that you see not: the multitudes of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> which cry aloud, of the resurrection.&mdash; 11. <em>D</em>., I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that seeds come to life, but I have not seen: bones that grew in Sheol, and sprang and came up.&mdash; 12. <em>M</em>., All your discourse is like yourself, for lo! Ezekiel: has taught you how in the valley, the dead come to life.&mdash; 13. <em>D</em>., Trees have I seen how in summer, they put on their garments: but bones in their nakedness, are cast into Sheol.&mdash; 14. <em>M</em>., <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> broke by his splendour, your heart, O Death: the son of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> has regained and put on, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Adam.&mdash; 15. <em>D.</em>, Our law in Sheol is this, to keep silence: for you are words and for me <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, O feeble ones.&mdash; 16. <em>M</em>., How are the aged passed over if you be vinedresser? He Who hindered you from <em>taking</em> their lives, the same quickens all.&mdash; 17. The babe in the womb confutes you, which is <em>as</em> buried there: to me it proclaims life from the dead, but to you despoiling.&mdash; 18. The despised flower despises you, for it is shut up and passed over: yet though lost it is not lost, but blossoms again.&mdash; 19. The chick cries out from the egg, wherein it is buried: and the graves are rent by a Voice, and the body arises.&mdash; 20. For a body too is the chick, that is in the egg: lo! Its body to our body proclaims, the life from the dead.&mdash; 21. With the locust your plea is overthrown, and ended, O Death: for in coming forth from the dust it teaches, the life from the dead.&mdash; 22. <em>D.</em>, I had been content if already, the resurrection had been: for the day of resurrection had disturbed me less, than your judgments.&mdash; 23. Merciful is the Son of the Highest, yea good and just: and will not harshly avenge on me, the death of Adam.&mdash; 24. Have you then no understanding, to perceive this: that your father laid on you, this retribution?</p>

<h2>Hymn 66.</h2>

<p>1. Hold your peace, O mortals (said Death), a little while: and be like me who am so silent, in the midst of Sheol.&mdash; 2. <em>R., To You be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, Watcher, that came down, after them that slept: and utter the voice from the Tree, and waken them!</em>&mdash; 3. You are grieving, yea, weeping, for him that has gone: as though he came to grind for me, the mill in Sheol.&mdash; 4. Great is the peace I give, unto the wearied: I wax not weary as you, nor weary them.&mdash; 5. I hear all manner of curses, from thankless men: the sons of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> are like Adam, who was thankless to his Lord.&mdash; 6. Contrary one to the other are <em>your</em> voices, and your doings: with your voices you weep and in your doings, you fight daily.&mdash; 7. I heard weeping and I thought to myself, that none labours: I saw toiling and I thought to myself, that no man dies.&mdash; 8. The struggles of man made me think, that he is not mortal: his great weeping made me think, that tomorrow he is not.&mdash; 9. Hear and let me be your counsellor, if you be willing: for these two, these burdens, are very bitter.&mdash; 10. Cease a little while from this toil, and from <em>this</em> weeping: toil and weep as mortals, who tomorrow vanish.&mdash; 11. You are frantic with weeping, for your departed: and you struggle in toiling, for your possessions.&mdash; 12. It is well with the infants that die, and blessed are they: for they are freed from the misery, whereunto you are cast.&mdash; 13. Allow me to go to Sheol, and there to say: <q>Happy are you silent dead, how tranquil are you!</q>&mdash; 14. Hear the conclusion of our own words, If there be a resurrection: weep not, neither labour as though strangers.&mdash; 15. You straggle as one who was to live, here forever: and you weep as one who never, should rise again.&mdash; 16. Hear my words, if there be with you place for hearing: and prepare you provision that when I call you may answer.&mdash; 17. For I hearken even I, to Him that calls me: and will restore your bodies, with your treasures.&mdash; 18. Let there be peace between us, until that day: and when you come forth I will cry and say, <q>Depart in peace!</q>&mdash; 19. Come, you and I even now, shall give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: to Him that brings to death and to life, that He may give aid.&mdash; 20. Praise from us all be to you, O Lord, the living Sacrifice! Who by the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of Your Body hast given life to quick and dead.&mdash; 21. Praise to Him Who clothed Himself in our body, and died and rose again: He died in us and we live in Him, blessed be He Who sent Him!</p>

<h2>Hymn 67.</h2>

<p>1. Come, let us hear how Death convicts the People: that harsher than Death was their sword, against the just.&mdash; 2. <em>R., To You be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, Who by Your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, hast redeemed our disgrace: and Whose death was instead of all deaths, that You might raise all!</em>&mdash; 3. It was not Death indeed that crucified Jesus, but <em>it was</em> the People: how hateful then the People, that are yet more hateful than I!&mdash; 4. Into the pit they cast Jeremiah, the miry <em>pit</em>: but I in Sheol allotted, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to his bones.&mdash; 5. Naboth they bruised <em>to death</em> with stones, as though <em>he were</em> a dog: how good am I who have never <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, even a dog!&mdash; 6. The Hebrew <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in famine, ate their children: Sheol <em>is</em> good who delivers and gives them up, without difficulty.&mdash; 7. To the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> I gave her son, by the hand of Elijah: to the Shunamite her beloved, by the hand of Elisha.&mdash; 8. The Hebrew <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in greed, ate their children: Sheol gave up the dead and learned, to fast soberly.&mdash; 9. Sheol was not indeed Sheol, but <em>its</em> semblance: <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel</a> was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Sheol, who devoured the just.&mdash; 10. The sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, she slew and cast down: to heaven Elijah escaped, from her fury.&mdash; 11. How many deaths instead of one Death, were among the People! And how many Sheols instead of one, were there also!&mdash; 12. <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> and Jezrael her daughters, in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: and Zion and Jerusalem her sister, in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>.&mdash; 13. Prophets and just men in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: in these two abysses, they were drowned.&mdash; 14. Why then is Sheol <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, and she alone: though there be many that are hateful, rather than she?&mdash; 15. The dead of the men of Judah, to me are right hateful: yea, abhorred by me are their bones, in the midst of Sheol.&mdash; 16. Would that then I had a way to cast them out: <em>to cast</em> their bones thence from Sheol, for they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> her to rot.&mdash; 17. I wonder at the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, that He thus dwelt: in the midst of a People whose savour stank, as their conversation.&mdash; 18. Onions and garlic <em>are</em> the heralds of their doings: as is the food so is the understanding, of this defiled people.&mdash; 19. Through the supplication of all that bow, and worship Your Father: have mercy on Your worshipper, who is thankless for Your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.&mdash; 20. From Hebrews and Aram&aelig;ans, and also from the Watchers: to You <em>be</em> praise and through You to Your Father, be also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>!&mdash; 21. For that I have a mouth to Death, who is without mouth: may the Son Who is all mouths, hold back my offense from His Father!</p>

<h2>Hymn 68.</h2>

<p>1. <em>Man.</em>, O, Death, be not boastful, over the just: the sons of your Lord who at His command, come to <em>dwell with you</em>.&mdash; 2. <em>R., To you be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that by Your command, Death has reigned: and by Your Resurrection has been humbled to low estate!</em>&mdash; 3. <em>Death.</em>, Herein am I exceeding great, according to your saying: that though I be bond-man I trample on them that are free.&mdash; 4. <em>M</em>., <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was chosen and ruler, and under his yoke: you, Death, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a>, your fellow, became bondmen.&mdash; 5. <em>D</em>., This is our <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> that lo! The slaves have become lords: Death, and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, his fellow, have trampled on Adam.&mdash; 6. <em>M</em>., Lo! The humbling of you and your fellow, accurst servants! How <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> trampled on you both, and rose aloft and reigned.&mdash; 7. <em>D</em>., If so be <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> made me grieve, yet have I comfort for on <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah's</a> dust in Sheol, lo! I trample.&mdash; 8. <em>M</em>., Tremble, O Death, before man, for though a servant, the yoke of his dominion reigns on all creatures.&mdash; 9. <em>D</em>., I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> then that they are no mean <em>foes</em> that I have overcome: for according to the greatness of the vanquished, he is great that overcomes.&mdash; 10. <em>M</em>., Well does your voice sing triumph, O Death, over the just: for <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> and Elijah have broken your pair of wings.&mdash; 11. <em>D</em>., I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <em>how</em> to weigh my sorrows with my comforts: in place of two, lo! Many have come and coming.&mdash; 12. <em>M</em>., All that have come and coming to you dwell as sojourners, and depart from your abode as Lazarus.&mdash; 13. <em>D</em>., This your saying hurts me not, rather it heals me: for Lazarus who rebelled against me, I again subdued.&mdash; 14. <em>M</em>., Make answer, O Death, and argue what constrained him, to be raised unless it were a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, showing forth his resurrection.&mdash; 15. <em>D</em>., You are famous in arguing as idle ones, while I labour in my task to discern and perform&mdash; 16. <em>M</em>., You were well prepared for argument, what has checked you? The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of our resurrection has constrained you by its reputations.&mdash; 17. <em>D</em>., You have made me <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by you, though I be not hateful: I am he that gives rest to your aged, and your afflicted.&mdash; 18. You have made me as one that troubles, O you mortals: <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> brought death upon you, and I bear the blame.&mdash; 19. Gently will I expose you, for I am a slave, and you are they that by your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have made me king.&mdash; 20. The will of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> roused me for I was at rest: I was dead and you quickened me, that you might die by me.&mdash; 21. I accuse the lying ones, who slew and denied it: for Adam slew himself and charges me.&mdash; 22. The beginning of strife was the accursed serpent which has rightly been crippled: which crept, entered, and set enmity between me and you.&mdash; 23. <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> is passed by and it is against me that you are roused: go, strive with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a> who made you transgress.&mdash; 24. He is my comrade and I deny <em>it</em> not, but though he be much <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, what need that I be blamed for him. I deny him henceforth.&mdash; 25. Hearken to my words, O mortals, and I will console you: I have afflicted you and I confess the life from the dead.&mdash; 26. For there begins to steal into my ears a voice of preparation: of the trumpet that holds itself ready to sound.&mdash; 27. Hear my words and put much oil into your lamps: for hindrance from my part there is none for you.&mdash; 28. <em>Yet</em>, Know that even although I have said these things, dear is the sound of your voice in the solitude of Sheol.&mdash; 29. For man has been weighed by me, and great is his peace: for snakes and fishes and birds come to meet him.&mdash; 30. But it is a marvel that to the Watchers, too, his converse is dear: yea, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a> in Gehenna, desires his presence.&mdash; 31. You shall have life from the dead, O you mortals, and I who am bereft shall be bereft in the midst of Sheol.&mdash; 32. Let praise ascend from all to You Who quickenest all, and from every quarter gatherest the dust of Adam!</p>
